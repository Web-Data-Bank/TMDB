When Prophet Muhammed gets his first revelation, the slaves are the first to believe him. Mecca’s notable residents torture the Muslim slaves to force them into giving up their beliefs. Ebu Cehil’s daughter, Zehra, is also one of these Muslims. Zehra’s beloved, Mesut, takes her to the quarry along with the slaves to be tortured. But through Zehra’s efforts, Mesut also converts to Islam. Mesut will be of great service, both when the Muslim populace migrates to Medina and when they start to face battles.
