Across the rails of change and transformation, documenting a time that has not been before and will not repeat again.  Heroes of the film have very different fates and experiences, but they are all connected by the place they found themselves in - the post-industrial and post-apocalyptic city, which becomes a part of their story and a hero of its own.  Students, transport, quaters, youth, revolution, local apocalypse, changes and turns - they all mix in a documentary kaleidoscope 'Across the Rails'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lFTBvBsZup36iDR4QJlCLQCBQYZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lodka Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2022-01-12","revenue":1000,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We could have made an anime about it","title":"Across the Rails","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
