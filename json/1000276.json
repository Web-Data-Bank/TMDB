We see ourselves as separate and superior from other human beings, based on race, class, sex, sexual orientation, religion, or whatever other distinction we can find. We see ourselves as separate and superior from the nonhuman animals and the natural world. As a result, we abuse, oppress, and exploit human beings, nonhuman animals, and the environment. This mindset is the root cause of unimaginable suffering and could lead to the destruction of our own world. Animal agriculture and our exploitative relationship with animals lies at the very heart of it all. If this world is going to survive, we need a new paradigm, a new understanding of our true interconnection with all other life, and a new relationship with each other and our world. Until all are free, none are free.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4XIcF8IOOjuNwPFygLCOPghPDDg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Until All Are Free","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
