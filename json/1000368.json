From his westerns and early novels of crime based in Detroit and South Florida, right through his complex and virtually plotless later work, Elmore Leonard dissected an America whose founding sins have continued to haunt it all the days. Leonard’s depiction of America is as real as Twain’s Hannibal, Faulkner’s Mississippi and Steinbeck’s Monterey. The new documentary ELMORE LEONARD: “But don’t try to write” explores the prolific author’s legacy and his influence on generations of writers. The documentary features exclusive images and previously unseen home movie footage, family photographs, and in-depth interviews with both literary experts and those who knew him well, including colleagues, family, and childhood friends.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/mwLzd17Gup6bcXLRVvhTd8RquB9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178855,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transmultimedia Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":178856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch Films, LLC","origin_country":""},{"id":26277,"logo_path":"/uXqiWcZbtSG2G9cQ031fRl2V0gH.png","name":"American Public Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The crime fiction writer who transcended the genre.","title":"Elmore Leonard: \"But Don't Try to Write\"","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
