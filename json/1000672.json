They are at turning points of their lives. The woman has an abortion. One man is getting more politically radical and joins a right-wing party. The other man breaks his ties with the Church and chooses apostasy. Even though they could not be more different in terms of their worldviews, they have one thing in common – each of them is trying to embrace their own uniqueness and understand who they are.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zocl5knFFnMt1ZTjOEi0CHvxp1Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Identity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
