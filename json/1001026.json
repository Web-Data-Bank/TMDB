They are seduced by a house in the middle of nature: space, a vegetable garden, a wood adjoining their garden and above all villagers who welcome them with open arms. A dream come true! But the young couple was soon to be disillusioned: the wood was actually a hunting ground for big game! Although the hunters are friendly, they are not willing to give up their territory, making Simon and Adélaïde's dream of the countryside a living hell. But true to their reputation, our Parisians are not going to let them do it.","popularity":1.618,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77552,"logo_path":"/3aeDaei9tONEGMvWm7W2TKxa1er.png","name":"Curiosa Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":75242,"logo_path":"/pviLhXu8yVavzS2Z1pthpv9Z4w5.png","name":"Pictanovo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":182987,"logo_path":null,"name":"Starman Films","origin_country":""},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":90562,"logo_path":"/qII3jJQ4S32FgJRlfSU267woloF.png","name":"TF1 Studio","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19037,"logo_path":"/tceh2aAORA5JxIZSLQ1GkzTBZDL.png","name":"uMedia","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Chasse gardée","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
