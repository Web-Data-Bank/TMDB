The film focuses on the ways our inner world is expressed in how we move — particularly subconscious movement. And, based on this, investigates the healing effects of liberated movement.  “I wanted to bring attention to the courage it takes to sit with the inevitable pain we experience as we seek to grow,” Furth shares. With this approach, the film further draws on a fascination with nature’s capacity to humble and inspire us, as well as the ways through which we can become more aware of, and receptive to, that innate strength.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/in1Et0kfDWb76PsDSXKZqTluxiq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2021-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WAYS OF SEEING","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
