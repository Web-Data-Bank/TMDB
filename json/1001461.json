One day, they take a look at the monitor to check the child, and then they see the child wearing dog skin and hiding his face. This is not good, the parents think, because they can't send the child to school like this. So they make Auto Mommy peel the dog skin off the child, only to find that the child became a plant without a human face.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ekOSZmjzz6woeMaIhMn1b3K3r9t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sovat Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Auto Mommy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
