But the inhabitants' enjoyment of their local festivals proved stronger, and the little town developed its own brass band. This is the story of that brass band, a brass band that isn't at all like a military band. It's a dancing brass band, an African brass band, that accompanies all the big and little moments of life: national festivals, religious ceremonies, funerals, fetes and celebrations, a musical game involving a football, tunes from the famous Mapuka dance, or the experimental use of sacred drums together with the brass band. A lively debate between the musicians, in which a sense of humor is clearly present, as they examine fundamental questions about their tradition and its transformations in the context of the life of people today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r8aPlYE70oYxfiNHmk62fSI5dcU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CI","name":"Cote D'Ivoire"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An African Brass Band: Traditional Music of Cote d'Ivoire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
