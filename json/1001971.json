The intercutting of the two stories creates a tension between the different world views of the woman and the man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fQs5JHbiGSUn1nile7fsH3bxbAS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jezebel Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":153395,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woman of the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
