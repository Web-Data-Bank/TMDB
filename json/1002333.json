Twice, Sandberg faced future Hall of Fame closer Bruce Sutter as the tying run in the Cubs’ last at-bat. Twice, he homered to the bleachers in left field to extend the game, which was later won on a walk-off single by Dave Owen. Subsequently, the game became known by a simple yet infamous moniker: \"The Sandberg Game.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cWllLqT0pwAE1Pi1YBMEzjEIqPN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sandberg Game","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
