Middle-aged and alienated, he feels the need to be a part of something - to build an orchard, even a home. Although dubious things happen in the village, Ilie only sees what suits him. The moment he gets involved in the village marks the beginning of his collapse. In a vacuum of solutions, he tries to be what he has never been before: the justice seeker who arrests everyone guilty.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/sGaWFDK9kmwxIlmDoGRq0yM0Jyt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13295,"logo_path":"/8cbVW2Fl4SknaBVZL5fNrreVWEK.png","name":"Papillon Film","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":159148,"logo_path":"/lPrQ4Msghtyumwyk09uKTiKEMGq.png","name":"Tangaj Production","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2022-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men of Deeds","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":5}
