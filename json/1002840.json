But during their 2019 Christmas getaway, they receive a call that shatters their sense of safety: their London home has been hit by burglars.  Evading a 24-hour security team on one of London’s most secure streets, three men have managed to penetrate Tamara’s jewellery room and Jay’s walk-in wardrobe. They’ve gathered more than 400 items of jewellery and watches valued at more than £26m. And they’ve disappeared into the night.  It’s the biggest home burglary in British history. But as the Metropolitan police piece together the events of 13 December 2019, they realise this is just the tip of the iceberg. Their investigation connects the theft to even more raids of celebrity homes.  Racing against the clock to gather crucial CCTV material before it’s erased forever, they uncover a trail that leads them first to Italy, then the Balkans. An international police operation is mobilised to locate the suspects.","popularity":0.932,"poster_path":"/zDZdP6RgK5eKfgRsd9ZjQWH8HU1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99697,"logo_path":"/uViS1T7QdziBUQ7wnDoAHdgKRt6.png","name":"BBC News","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Stole Tamara Ecclestone’s Diamonds?","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
