But It Did Happen develops the story in a very restrained manner in which the characters’ emotions are not exposed; the beautiful melody of Chopin’s “Tristesse”, which is the only music used in the film, successfully adds to the film’s profundity. Yuichi Suita is an emerging filmmaker whose short films have been selected at numerous film festivals, including How Beautiful Japanese Morning Is (11) at the 23rd Sao Paulo International Short Film Festival and the 43rd Tampere Film Festival, and The Day She Commits Suicide (13) at the 43rd International Film Festival Rotterdam. What exactly has happened to the characters? And why did it happen? Yoshiko Tatsumi, in the leading role, and the other four actresses, express their characters with subtle facial expressions and movements, which shouldn’t be missed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h2qiXGG1zYgEB1rNLk8E0A2AxSU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"But It Did Happen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
