Children are playing, running around, laughing loud and enjoying their time. The sudden death of a pigeon is the start of a destruction to all these beauties. Time goes on and people get more and more cruel. An intimate warm space turns into a low quality, black and white world which reminds every spectator of a cheese game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5XxCFkMBlTyr1MprZoxY8l10m08.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2022-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gambit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
