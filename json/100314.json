Molly Duggan is determined to discover a treatment, because in rare cases, it can kill: Her mother was one of its victims. But what science can't explain is why Molly suddenly starts experiencing episodes herself and during them, feels a sinister presence surrounding her. So she turns to legends, and that's when her real nightmare begins. Haylie Duff stars in this pulse-pounding chiller.","popularity":1.996,"poster_path":"/2hISTFqNC3CmaK6W9xpe5ItHIQa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightmare","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":4}
