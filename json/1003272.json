He busied himself building forts and bridges, winning the support of the local population and making plans for a return to France. When he did return, it was to an ecstatic welcome from his former troops and it was not long before he was reinstated as Emperor and at war once again. But there was to be no glorious ending to the tale. Instead it ended in spectacular and bloody failure in June 1815 on the famous battlefield of Waterloo. Napoleon's old enemy the Duke of Wellington once again beat his forces and this time there was no way back.\r Napoleon died in exile on St. Helena just six years later, but the legend of his military genius had only just begun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3fYuZPa0S6TQOcrR2CqnlRnkx0q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Napoleon: Waterloo: The Final Curtain","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
