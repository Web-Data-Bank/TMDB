John Funn, a lonely Missing Persons detective at the frayed end of a once promising career, hitches his wagon to the rising star of a strange and impressionable young sergeant named Snookie. Computo, a World War II Army surplus robot, and Crazy Legs, an horrifically injured streetfighter, eke out a desperate living hawking mislabelled narcotics, while patiently awaiting happier times. Woven throughout the unraveling of these two dysfunctional partnerships is the story of a bizarre Missing Persons case involving a mysterious half-drowned man living one foot below the surface of the Atlantic ocean. A tale told in a cycle of interlocking absurdities--played almost alarmingly straight--MISSING PERSONS is an entirely CGI-generated 3D animated film, rendered in \"toon-style\" using custom software.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missing Persons","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
