Encircling the mountain, they killed thousands of Yazidi men and abducted an estimated 5,000 women and children to be sold at slave markets.  With no help forthcoming, a Yazidi smuggler named Abu Shuja used his skills and network to steal back the people languishing in ISIS captivity. His success of rescuing over 500 people lead to ISIS placing a $500,000 bounty on his head, eventually pitting him and his family against the need to flee their country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v5cdCTj82H4Dww6eG3Dr43ekLwY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Victims of ISIS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
