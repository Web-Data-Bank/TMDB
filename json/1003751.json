The work is created from two basic compositional premises; pulse and feedback. The backbone of the composition is a stream of visual and sonic pulses, leaving its intervals to be explored and brought to life by a feedback generating a network, consisting of envelopes, gates, compressors, and masks. The intertwining layers provide the experience of an elaborate audiovisual time-space-continuum. Running almost entirely without input from the outside world, the system becomes a magnifier of its own rudimentary functions and algorithms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g9lALqNzPn4nWiWeP0LDwalLeM0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Semaphore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
