Newspapers are piled on the benches and blow around the chamber when they are caught in an unexpected breeze. Headlines charting polarised opinions across the political spectrum are seen clashing and scattering amid the general mess and chaos.  The work was filmed in darkness at night and in daylight the following day, using two cameras, a drone and a wind machine. One camera acts as passive observer and the other (on the drone) acts as an agitator that disrupts the familiar space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j9ZcUYhEiN37KWuMzkq2gOMm4kg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left, Right & Centre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
