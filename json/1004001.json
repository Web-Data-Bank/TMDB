One widowed father finds out that answer when his son suddenly disappears while playing in the backyard. The boy's abduction is linked to the mysterious disappearances of the Anasazi Indian tribe, more than 70 years ago. Jim Cole's (Derrik Woodbury) search is aided by his former high school sweetheart Meg (Nicola McGillicuddy) and an ancient map of Indian petroglyphs. The couple are prepared for their jopurney by a Native American woman (Linda Ianella ) who knows of the Anasazi, and perhaps why Jim's son was taken. Following the map in the scenic Castle Rock area of southern Utah, they discover a sacred stone arch, recently revealed after a long drought. With time running out, Jim and Meg face a climactic showdown in the battle to rescue his young son.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aQnklHt9xNGPiEpn2HWsYzptlIL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fairfield Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A mysterious stranger...A Missing Son...A desperate search before time runs out...","title":"Legend of the Magic Arch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
