As part of his campaign he is backing the building of a holocaust memorial near parliament square, to help the campaign gain traction Steve and his campaign manager Dan invite social influencer Leah on board as a one woman focus group. As Dan, Steve and Leah try and persuade the divided community to back the memorial their own motivations are challenged as the political and personal ties between them are tested to the very limit. A powerful, funny, intelligent political drama, that looks at the stark contrast in views and voices in and around our capital, the ever-growing divisions between the generations, and the challenging task of mending and learning to ensure we do and are better.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/otLgI1NvDQeksbTM0VWJfFKHhlx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Original Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tikkun Olam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
