This work, A-Su-Ra-Bal-Bal-Ta (2021), juxtaposes the space represented by digital technology with the repeated sound \"Asurabalbalta\", a kind of magic spell derived from a film. Exploring the different meanings created from the gap between what is represented by advanced technology and the aspirations of blind human desires, this work addresses issues found in modern Korean society that relate to space that is both limited and shared.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/huoN1G94c1r7QmiD8L9YukB4p1Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A-Su-Ra-Bal-Bal-Ta","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
