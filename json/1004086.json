The test employs a series of ten inkblot cards, and the test taker is asked to provide their perceptions or perspectives on the presented images. The test was considered effective in identifying and diagnosing schizophrenia and was administered to Nazi war criminals in an attempt to understand the Nazi personality. Often criticized as pseudoscience, the Rorschach is still used and remains controversial. The test is often referred to as Ro-sha (short for Rorschach) in Korea. The film Rosha tells stories spoken by a girl named Rosha. It is a photogram of the ten inkblot images on B&W 16mm film. The images overlap and break apart, leaving impressions on the film surface. When the film is projected, the printed inkblots turn into Rosha's glossolalia,* which lies between language and non-language.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tZjjDNumkVzLH5UF6cUFpLeEH9T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
