Adam Ashburn's Showreel is an experimental dark comedy that takes the form of an amateur Malaysian actor's showreel, dissecting and exploring the bizarre Malaysian filmmaking landscape with great cynicism and poetic justice. Adam Ashburn's Showreel is a love/hate letter to Malaysian cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/teXhLOqbSPnOiwUtaGABc6hbhGt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumidor Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2022-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adam Ashburn's Showreel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
