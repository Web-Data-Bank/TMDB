Socorro - meaning 'aid' or 'help' - was given its name in the 16th century by Spanish colonizers as a token of gratitude: as the Spaniards emerged from a very barren stretch of desert, native Piro Indians offered them food and water. More recently, the area has been physically imprinted with the history of atomic bomb testing and hypersonic weapons research.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wwdHXh0W8guq2Dg5PXWXw9o2Qtl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demolition of a Wall (Album 2)","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
