This work is the first stone of the major project named Cell Worlds that brings the microscopy images where they never went before. Far from the laboratories and the scientists’ hard drives and as close as possible to human cells. Here, everything is genuinely real and above all alive. Each image of the exhibition consists of true cells: from the electrifying neuron to the fragile embryo to the melancholic blood flows of the brain. Visitors discover a shimmering-coloured world of an unbelievable variety.  Cell Immersion also stands as one of the major science research showcases, bringing together numerous teams, laboratories, and institutes worldwide. A demonstration that sciences and arts have no borders. Enthralling, this journey will arouse the visitors’ scientific curiosity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cell Immersion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
