He remembers the pre-production of his first film, a Class-B movie with ghosts. The young queer scene of Medellín is casted for the film, but the main protagonist dies of a heroin overdose at the age of 21, just like many friends of the director. Anhell69 explores the dreams, doubts and fears of an annihilated generation, and the struggle to carry on making cinema.","popularity":12.329,"poster_path":"/dKCZEMCctYEaM30ResU2BqJkqJL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97760,"logo_path":"/4ZKbXGBg1aR6PuNjw8SGf55USq7.png","name":"Dublin Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":48477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amerikafilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":132383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Film","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2023-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anhell69","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
