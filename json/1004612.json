Several critics saw in Albertine Proust’s driver Alfred Agostinelli, a young Italian with whom Proust had been madly in love. The novel and Proust’s life become the excuse for a contemporary love story – where Marcel, Albertine and Alfred hide, bluff, swap genders and roles, experiencing love as an eternal question, aware that the heart of things cannot be captured, but only glimpsed at.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p0L5CtBFCbiDhladrqiJQOychWX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182159,"logo_path":"/hWbdYJW26HLpyrpdroXXCKNGOoD.png","name":"Guidone Apulia Factory","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albertine Where Are You?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
