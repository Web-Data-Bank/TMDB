He is a “ghost” to his peers who know him only for what they see: someone different, labelled by simplistic stereotypes. Sayid, on the other end, is a young migrant, one of the many teenagers who, like ghosts, leave traces on those same paths. These two creatures meet in a magical place and help each other make themselves less invisible in their own eyes, through a short journey through the woods towards the real world. On this journey, the two get to know each other and learn about the other’s fears and passions, realising they are not as different as they seem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zQnOlqTcM7pZ7RSVEbrt3FqBGii.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like Snails","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
