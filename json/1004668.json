The boundaries between dream and passion are very elusive.  Life is full of physical deprivations and, of course, sensual pleasures, and the deep meaning of that all is Love.  The deeper the feeling, the more intense the emotions. Each girl dreams about meeting her love one day.  An experienced man helps her discover the world of passion and senses, and brings her to ‘heaven’s gate’ where the two of them will prevail.  One can only imagine how many hearts were broken along the way to master the science of love.  But passion blinds and soon the man becomes slave to the young woman’s sensual body.  The carnal knowledge makes the girl try to subdue her love object.  This is what the last film by Kim Ki-duk, shot in summer 2019 in Kyrgyzstan, is all about.  The film was finished by Kim’s friends and colleagues after he unexpectedly passed away in December 2020.","popularity":0.917,"poster_path":"/6PuUuAjiNU1kztaoTwaFURr7qcM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":684,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kim Ki Duk Film","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":200401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Estofilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"KG","name":"Kyrgyz Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2022-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kirghiz","iso_639_1":"ky","name":"??????"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call of God","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":7}
