Increasingly concerned during 1944—with Germany clearly losing the war—that a U.S. post-war monopoly on such a powerful weapon after the war could lead to nuclear catastrophe, he decided beginning that October to start passing key information about the bomb’s construction to the Soviet Union. After the war, at the University of Chicago, he met and married Joan, a fellow student with whom he shared a passion for classical music and socialist causes — and the explosive secret of his espionage. Living under a cloud of suspicion and years of FBI surveillance and intimidation, the pair raised a family while Ted refocused his scientific brilliance on groundbreaking bio-physics research.","popularity":2.165,"poster_path":"/bAauKbpcr7ja6fAM752zcJWjwHW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6735,"logo_path":"/pAQW38WU8ychBvYU2aGPTEbynEN.png","name":"Participant","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13042,"logo_path":"/k57hcv8sELrZCf1j33FDBNGDpF6.png","name":"Kartemquin Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":161595,"logo_path":"/vVjYeWNqsFe8imr2n0qNawMupyR.png","name":"Mitten Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Did he betray his country to save the world?","title":"A Compassionate Spy","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
