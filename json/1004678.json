The film poses existential questions to influential jazz players such as Bill Frisell, Lee Konitz, Midori Takada and many others: How does it feel to play, and what does it mean to listen? What is it like to be a human being and spending your whole life trying to express something through sounds? The characters wake up, rehearse, record, perform and talk about music. In some moments they are on the edge, the edge of existence, constantly challenging themselves. They listen. They devote themselves to finding a space to create a connection to something bigger than themselves. Something that will outlast all of us.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/aBs52Jw58yUOlZtjR8GeMT9tbhr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anorak","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music for Black Pigeons","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
