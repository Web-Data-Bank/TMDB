The film lays bare the ‘banality of evil’ and is devastatingly relevant today, as Ukrainian people are once again being subjected to the violence of barbarian invaders.","popularity":1.192,"poster_path":"/tYu0dXVPPwrtO1c91f29xPqG1sN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109618,"logo_path":"/hHgwcVNXh3WE1UbtIOu8EcU7j3d.png","name":"Atoms \u0026 Void","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kiev Trial","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
