They discuss the events that led to their breakup 7 years ago, while a robotic camera autonomously scans the apartment. The video is edited to look as though it is a seamless single take, a time warp in which Fogel and Lee appear in multiple places in the apartment at the same time.  Commissioned by Visual AIDS in 2014 as part of ALTERNATE ENDINGS, a program of seven videos that bring together charged moments and memories from their personal perspective amidst the public history of HIV/AIDS.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":139738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual AIDS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7 Years Later","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
