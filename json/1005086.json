Advertisements dominate the spectator with appeals to buy products that have military as well as domestic uses: spray the life out of garden pests with insecticide, make your clothes whiter with bleach, and think of cowboys and Indians while you do it. On the other side of the world, another form of domination holds sway. A Great Way of Life is a horror film as relevant today as it was in 1970. [Overview courtesy of William E.
