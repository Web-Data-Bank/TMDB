Something that changed everything. Well, actually, it was a lot of different things, and he can’t really tell them apart that well. It’s as is if everything happened at once. Some fragments stand out; a car, a gust of wind, sunshine reflecting off that building. Feet on the asphalt. And Mads, his intrusive, abusive friend, with some kind of grand plan to fix everything. And someone so perfect, you’ll always remember them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sCLB1XosdPdtwdY70DOaKBWcz6E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything At Once","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
