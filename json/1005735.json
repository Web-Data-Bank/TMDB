No tour dates, this time: she is simply setting out to see her fans, her loved ones and all the places where she became a star, once again. For the occasion, Olimpia has hired a young woman, Maria, as shy and awkward as Olimpia isn’t, to be her driver.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wUvlL69JfOQiAruLwMANTEVTjeu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127967,"logo_path":null,"name":"K+","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olimpia's Way","video":false,"vote_average":6.875,"vote_count":4}
