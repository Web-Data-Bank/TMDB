There are two generations who went through that experience, in one way or another, and twenty years later they cannot consider the case closed. The dream behind the protests at Genoa 2001 is still alive: the issues then addressed are today’s issues, only more urgent. And the violence of Genoa 2001 is not over, since although that violence has been recounted many times, from different sides, and celebrated or condemned, it has never been understood or resolved.","popularity":1.247,"poster_path":"/5emuwT4X7LgWz9BfvF1ydG2FUsG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dream and the Violence","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
