Consequently they were \"canned\" by the management. A brilliant idea; one would play the wild man in the village square, a real live show of their own. Rooly and Pooly then basked in the society of fair country belles, but Dooly at length was rescued by Miss Smart, looking for excitement. She was not disappointed.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope \u0026 Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almost a Wild Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
