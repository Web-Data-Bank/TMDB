The title is the combination of two essential reference points: Notes From Underground (Dostoevsky) and A Cyborg Manifesto (Haraway).\" -Connor Parsley","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/78OwXxTFpQknpoJc54dQAldl9la.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes From The Integrated Circuit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
