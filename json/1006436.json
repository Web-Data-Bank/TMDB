Authors, directors, actors who have proved that imposture could be an act of creation. Convinced that any so-called “new” cinematographic production was in fact a rehash of what had already been made, these pirates of images snuck as forgers, liars, tricksters, usurpers, … Outlaws of the cinema who falsified its form. From the filmed imposture of Man Bites Dog to Jan Bucquoy’s fabulist biopic, everything participates in the dynamiting of institutional language through simulacrum and absurdity. This free journey in the “cine-belgitude” has for vocation to approach these marvellous eccentrics followers of a overexcited and stripping situationism.","popularity":1.195,"poster_path":"/zDN2dZNA7VVYq0BnGj1smc4HPE1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34069,"logo_path":"/i8ALsnHxQ5JsQdoiHY1vxEmoEnJ.png","name":"Panique!","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":94321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beall Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mad in Belgium","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
