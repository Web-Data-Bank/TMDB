Funded by Dixie Evans' social security checks, the Exotic World Museum is a Mojave Desert haven for burlesque legends of the 19040s to 1960s, and ground zero of the latest burlesque revival. But as Dixie's health declines, County regulators threaten the operation, and the desert assails the museum's aging collection of 8x10 portraits, hand-sewn costumes and memorabilia, will Exotic World survive?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exotic World and the Burlesque Revival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
