Jarret, a firefighter from Pittsburgh’s historic African American Hill District, and span nearly three hours. As you watch family members and neighbors’ lives, from weddings to living room dance parties, a storyline emerges. Following Jarret’s death, years of neglect caused chemical decomposition of the image, resulting in a kaleidoscopic effect that evokes experimental filmmaking techniques. The Museum’s preservation of the film resulted in its return to the Jarret family descendants; it appears here with their approval.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cQBM2Pr3MrvfgA2o90AoFpR1RQy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jarret Family Home Movies (1958-67)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
