After two hundred years as an independent nation, Peru has many forgotten struggles in different territories and from different times. Marking the country’s bicentennial anniversary, this super 8mm film brings together activists and families in a compilation of speeches from history’s B-side. A beautiful, stirring expression of liveness, agency, resistance, and the intergenerational obligation to renew and refresh our communal commitment to rights and democracy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c8ZLZBbwcs8KtRyPLE1XKmiUop.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mano Alzada","origin_country":""},{"id":32759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bergman Was Right Films","origin_country":"PE"},{"id":164652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineclub de Lambayeque","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2022-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After The Dust","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
