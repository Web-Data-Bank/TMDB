Father, mother and son. They are no different from thousands and thousands of other families, except that they are happy. They love each other. The sudden illness of the son drives through them with an asphalt roller. Parents are ready for anything, they lose their home, and sometimes their human form, trying to save their child. At some point, even the mother breaks down. But not the father. The most ordinary person. A provincial carpenter.","popularity":0.968,"poster_path":"/fRNGzBOo9kUHFSrXARiSj5HN756.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71156,"logo_path":"/jnYrp67FATgZgyP5Qvy9VgxvBR.png","name":"Hype Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carpenter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
