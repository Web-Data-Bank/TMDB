Perpetuating the critique of consumerism initiated with the deformation of bodies by the deformation of goods , the artist explores the excesses of a consumer society where we seek to consume more and more through the imagined life of our homes . It is also the subject of a video . The house is seen in the midst of an identity crisis ( Am I a house ? Or just a work of art ? And why am I fat ? ) . Using a fat house as both a sculpture and a video space to explore , he physically reclaims the identity of living space : houses feel and speak , they are also bodies and voices .","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fat House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
