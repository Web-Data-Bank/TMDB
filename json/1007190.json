Given the number of protagonists, it is also the story of a tragedy.  Only 14 years after the premiere of Hernani, Giuseppe Verdi adapted Victor Hugoâ€™s play into an opera to premiere at La Fenice, Venice in 1844. Ernani was an immediate and lasting triumph for the young Verdi, marking his prowess at adapting an historical event (the crowning of Charles V as emperor at Aachen Cathedral) to a psychologically convincing musical drama. The backdrop of three men paying court to one woman was the perfect foil for Verdi to explore the expressive qualities of three types of male voice. The tenor, the bass and the baritone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5QJy521xikwiWZAG62tEtCMWVKL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ernani - ROMA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
