She is a writer for and founding partner of the media company Puck. She previously reported on politics and world affairs for The Atlantic.  This interview was conducted by FRONTLINE’s Mike Wiser on March 3, 2022. It has been edited for clarity and length.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"“because he is losing and because the sanctions and the Ukrainians are humiliating him, because he is backed into a corner, he is the most dangerous he has ever been, because it is now existential for him.”","title":"Putin's Road to War: Julia Ioffe (interview)","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
