During fertility rituals, like rain ceremonies, women in their songs and dances demonstrate obscene behaviour while they behave like men. These are secret performances open strictly for elderly men and women. Still, we were invited to record the rain making ceremony in the land of Chief Chassuka, Manika Province in Mozambique, in order to document the ritual for the younger generations. These rituals are a fading tradition probably due to the special character of the songs and dances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yqRvokrSG7SXO3suGb7Ru1wRfr1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"MZ","name":"Mozambique"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Shona","iso_639_1":"sn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If Vagina Had Teeth: The Shona Rainmaking Ceremony in Western Mozambique","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
