Raised on the raw and isolated Canadian coast, Raph Bruhwiler, Sepp Bruhwiler, and Peter Devries have been at the forefront of surfing’s progression into cold and hostile environments. From backyard beachbreaks to empty barrels slabbing over wilderness reefs, the second film from photographer Jeremy Koreski continues their surfing story. Off the map on Canada’s Clayoquot coast, storm swells surge onto the reefs and beaches of Vancouver Island, creating heavy weather, heavy seas, heavy wildlife, and some of the world’s most futuristic surfing in the world’s most primordial landscape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bCMQ4LLTNKO6lQ5GsUiPsAEgn3z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shrink","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
