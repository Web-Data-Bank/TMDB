The film follows Grammy award winning Roy Hargrove from Los Angeles, Paris, New York, Vienne, Perugia, SÃ¨te, Sorrento and Marseille during a summer European tour in what would be the last year of his life. An epic love letter from first time director Eliane Henri, the film features interviews and live performances by Roy inclusive of musical icons Erykah Badu, Herbie Hancock, Mos Def, Robert Glasper, Wynton Marsalis and Sonny Rollins who reflect on the magic of his music, Roy's impact on the next generation and his place in the history of jazz. Key conversations reverberate beyond Roy's personal story and enter the terrain of what it means to be an artist, particularly in the American context.","popularity":0.689,"poster_path":"/vn4WRukOZGhtt41bMCgPKP3F9pO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hargrove","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
