To follow this art historian, curator of the cinema collections at the Centre Pompidou, is to go from the oriental carpet to the film, or from the first fireworks to the cinema. And everywhere the animation of the images - projections of Antony McCall, or of Paul Sharits, Column without end of Brancusi, Pasolini's Accatone - everything moves!  Under the tutelage of Aby Warburg, the great art historian of the early twentieth century, precursor of iconology and image comparison, to whom Philippe-Alain Michaud was the first in France to devote an important essay, eleven images are placed on the table to describe the singular journey of this art historian.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1kK4PGDR4EKT1FitzBzgCnTwhwM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18740,"logo_path":"/11dLmhNuO6Pgd8tSDvktsOkP94R.png","name":"Zadig Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philippe-Alain Michaud, le réel traversé par la fiction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
