Invited by “Pig” director Mani Haghighi to go through The Report, the Iranian maestro details his working methods and approach to this deftly crafted, semiautobiographical domestic drama, while revealing the solitude of being a director, and his unparalleled views towards suicide, a concept later realised in Taste of Cherry. This candid, intimate conversation delving deep into Kiarostami’s craft provides remarkable insight on his artistry and worldview.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":185,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Conversation on The Report","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
