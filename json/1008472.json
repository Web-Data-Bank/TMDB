With exceptionally beautiful choreography by Lynn MacMurrey, we see Brian \"being born\" in an array of multi-colored patterns, finally bursting forth into life by discovering himself alone on top of a mountain. Upon seeing himself for the first time in a clear mountain pool, he becomes keenly aware of his loneliness and ventures forth in search of love. Dancing nude up and down streets, he finally comes upon Erik Carlson. Immediately the scene changes to an all black background as the two perform a pas de deux of love and lovemaking that must be seen to be truly appreciated. This is the first known nude ballet performed by two males that has ever been presented on the screen - and it promises to be one of the most successful films to ever come from Pat Rocco's Bizarre Productions.\" (https://calisphere.org/item/18d4ac513859aaba7a783758ecc24915/)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Breath of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
