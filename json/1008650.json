It would not come around again. They were artists who sought each other out and used politics to engage with society and change lives, in a season that started with the post-war economic boom and ended in a reaction against the upheaval of the 1968 protests. Stock footage, film clips, and interviews with the leading figures of the day, all collected over the years, make Era Roma the distillation of an amazing, turbulent era when the arts blurred the borders with real life and tried to turn reality into a work of art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Era Roma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
