Her filmmaker daughter Rea Tajiri is also her caregiver. In this fond portrait, she visualizes Rose’s spiritual, philosophical and sometimes surprisingly specific stories in the order they come: a non-linear sequence illustrated by her own footage shot over many years, accompanied by snatches of conversations and images from the family archive. Rose’s eventful journey through time is rich with memories and sensitively accompanied by a fitting soundtrack.","popularity":0.664,"poster_path":"/pLV2p5N2ST0bKpFWauWUtbuQNrz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180031,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ghost Pictures Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":139944,"logo_path":"/AhidH8FFYTAzexStLcJNQg2Tree.png","name":"Center for Asian American Media (CAAM)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":185967,"logo_path":null,"name":"Farthest Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wisdom Gone Wild","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
