The lens follows the work of the Citizens' Movement of Thessaloniki and their struggle to prevent the government's decision to detach and dismember the antiquities that were excavated at the Venizelos station, during the metro works. It covers the 15 months from the birth of the Movement to Christmas 2020. In addition to amateur videos, which selectively capture this entire period, the filming took place during the second lockdown and imposed different filming conditions and the use of material from online interviews or online House meetings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AsqN539XNCwrowQYWRvXuKIcy6F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":182679,"logo_path":null,"name":"ΕΡΤ3","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crime at Venizelos Station","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
