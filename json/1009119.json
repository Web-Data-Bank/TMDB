She has everything going for her: she's popular at school, she's got a great job at the local diner, she's got college to look forward to in a few months. What more could a girl ask for? Love? She has that too, the two people Emma loves the most: her step-brother, Chad, and her best friend, Brittany, also love her. She lives the ideal life in a suburban neighbourhood, surrounded by love and acceptance, but she has one problem that keeps her from being seen as \"normal,\" she suffers from insomnia that distorts reality from dreams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/keK5IL7SXnrJvWy4MqcrR35ewSv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111525,"logo_path":"/gbY2zC7Pp2lAXoDTQPKJKyISUwf.png","name":"MissaX","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insomniac","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
