An amusement park is set up in an alana in the fall, the plot is deserted in the winter, and in the spring it serves as a stadium where the school's gymnastics demonstrations take place, which during the Junta become another tool of disorientation from the regime. A composition of moments of life as it flows in one of the then less glittering corners of the capital, where a space acquires its own essence. The passage of time sculpts the character of a piece of land, leaving its marks on it, just as it would on a person. Moments of joy and vitality give way to a rainy melancholy, like mood swings at the change of seasons. Until interest, an external force, dissolves everything during the construction of a building. The end is inexorable and inevitable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oIIPVzZtxPDB0EwKZjyMaKP8Bbu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1971-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
