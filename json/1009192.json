When the beautiful chanteuse Hung (Law Yim-hing) is forced to marry Commander Lau (Lau Hark-suen), her brother (Cheng Wai-sum) interferes but is brutally beaten to death. Hung also falls to her death when she tries to escape. The siblings are only hastily buried in a coffin home, which is haunted soon afterwards. Hung's lover Wong (Wong Chiu-mo) later sneaks into the haunted house hoping to see her for one last time; Lau, meanwhile, insists on inspecting the coffin home and the corpses to prove that ghosts do not exist…The film creates an eerie and uncanny atmosphere with its well-designed camera angles, sound and editing. The haunting looks of the two ghost characters are a nod to Hong Kong's typically told horror stories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":180073,"logo_path":null,"name":"Changxing Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1955-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stealing the Beauty's Corpse at Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
