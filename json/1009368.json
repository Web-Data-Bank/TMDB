While Howe first made his name with classical depictions of life in the American West, after he came out as a gay man, he began a series of paintings which focused on images of the male form. Howe returned to his home town to show \"Stations: A Gay Passion,\" a collection of paintings that blended biblical images with depictions of homosexual eroticism, at a local museum. As might have been expected, the exhibit was the subject of protests from the Christian Evangelical community, and The Truth or Consequences of Delmas Howe is a documentary which explores Howe's life, his work, and the controversy it has generated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zv7Y8CqhKYBaAGJjwj6NCycMtO8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Truth or Consequences of Delmas Howe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
