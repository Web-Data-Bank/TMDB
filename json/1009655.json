The pair live together, they love to do the same things, they're the best of friends, but lately Paul has been distant.  He's been brooding and sullen, he scrolls his cellphone and ignores his stepsister who's standing in front of him in a towel.  \"What are you looking at?\"  Gracie takes the phone away and sees that Paul is looking at his ex-girlfriend, Lola's social media page.  Gracie rolls her eyes, \"I thought you were over her.  You said yourself she was all wrong for you.\"  Paul confesses that he's not.  It looks like she's dating guys again, just six months after their relationship ended, and Lola has been on Paul's mind every day since the break up.  Gracie encourages him to get out of the house with her, to play a round of tennis, have fun and live life!  Paul agrees until he gets a text.  It's Lola!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rDELXrfDXc0dHehMzbvP7sIFscG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111525,"logo_path":"/gbY2zC7Pp2lAXoDTQPKJKyISUwf.png","name":"MissaX","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Great Catch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
