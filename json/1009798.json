A murderer whose statute of limitations is about to expire is shown on TV, and detective Kiyoshi Atsumi heads to Tokyo, but... The upstart Keiju Kobayashi, his old friend Etsuko Ichihara, and Atsumi. The postwar experiences of three people who were tossed about by the war overlap. The screenplay by Satoru Hayasaka, the music by Kousuke Kanno, and above all, the performances of Atsumi and Ichihara make this a masterpiece in the history of TV dramas. A two-hour version was later created as an art festival award-winning work.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/tpZCsp70qeB2wduiSb0hEv8rEhU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73591,"logo_path":"/1y1nlmPPWqFwGkTSoKMVvwjNzBr.png","name":"TELEPACK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1977-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"田舎刑事　時間よ、とまれ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
