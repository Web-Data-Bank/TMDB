The wedding photographer wants Darren with all his groomsmen outside in the garden for photos. John calls out, \"Darren... DARREN!\" He hears music coming from upstairs. He follows the sound until it gets louder, and louder, and then he sees Stella, his stepsister, standing in front of him in lingerie and a veil. Her eyes are puffy as she's been crying. He shields his eyes politely. Stella scoffs at him, \"it's not like you haven't seen me in my underwear before.\" John asks for Jack and Stella could care less, she has so much more on her mind, like should she even be marrying this guy? John assures Stella that they're perfect together, but she doesn't want to hear it. Stella's main concern is the big question of how can she sneak around and have naughty sex with her stepbrother when she's married?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rQg7goqKKND66b0YMLWKWcKlxjl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111525,"logo_path":"/gbY2zC7Pp2lAXoDTQPKJKyISUwf.png","name":"MissaX","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something Borrowed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
