Boris Petkovič explores in great detail the evolution of a music style which, from the very start, has intimately reflected the social situation of its artists. Hip hop has always absorbed the \"vibes\" of the place where it is taking root, and Slovenia is no exception. According to Petkovič, in today's Slovenia, rap is the one and only form of music that discusses the state of our society and of human relationships without any inhibitions. If rap is not your cup of tea, this film can make you change your mind.","popularity":0.667,"poster_path":"/9xiBIlXFArBhs4T8j1CdVbd5cbj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luksuz DZMP","origin_country":""},{"id":180202,"logo_path":null,"name":"Katapult","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2011-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Year of Hip Hop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
