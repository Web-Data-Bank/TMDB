He headed the International Longshoremen and Warehouseman Union from the 1930's to the 1970's and was a champion of workers' causes on an international scale.  Harry Bridges (July 28, 1901 - March 30, 1990) was controversial as he was charismatic. He was prosecuted by FDR, Truman and Eisenhower alike, and convicted by a federal jury for having lied about Communist Party membership-a conviction which was set aside. On the West Coast, Bridges still excites passions both for and against the labor movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gUQ9m4JWqNawbE5nJqBXYJqQZ5p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harry Bridges: A Man and His Union","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
