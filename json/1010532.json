How do we build a landscape of an island? By modifying the geography or by spreading its visual representations?  Let’s replace the first inquiry with another one: “Have we ever listened to Matsu?”What would we listen to first? Who would we listen to? What do people in Matsu listen to? As islanders, do they listen to the sounds of the sea or to the sounds of the neighboring country? Is there any document we can listen to about Matsu?  Just like images and the internet conspired to transform our vision and memory, may recorded sounds could alter our listening, and therefore our perception of these islands?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tFpCY9KbDPPlcJEK2KeBxmxcMT0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Have we ever been to Matsu?”","title":"She Heard Nothing in Matsu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
