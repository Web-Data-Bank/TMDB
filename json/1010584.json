Based on the contents of the famous letter by Pero Vaz de Caminha, this is the video version of an “(im)possible film” that oscillates back and forth between documentary and fiction. From the subtracted image, we see only the “film picture,” old, scratched, worn out by five hundred years of existence and overuse. The sound of the words has also been removed, seeing as the dialogue between conquistador and native, strictly speaking, did not take place. All that is left is the sound of the ocean and the wind, witnesses to the events. The account that remains takes the shape of subtitle-text.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pW9RXlsWpsf6ZSVM6yVoLOETsVw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vera Cruz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
