As a child, he was brought to England on a slave ship from Senegal and grew up as a servant of Sir John Phillips. He later gained independence and became a successful coal merchant and a wealthy gentleman who lived in a white house by the River Thames.  A local man comes across this white house during a walk through the town centre. He calls a phone number that he finds on a sign outside the building. At a time of restricted human interaction, this attempt to make contact with the houseâ€™s former inhabitant from 200 years ago takes an unexpected turn.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dqV7J73UcnWGnkVgp2oUlOrkMM5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9,000 Square Feet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
