They examine the impact of society’s stereotypes on their lives in the workplace, in their personal relationships and within their families and in their communities. In the course of their dialogue, they also explore the differences and similarities between racism and sexism – an area that has seldom been researched, but has heatedly become a very important issue needing to be understood and dealt with.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/narC89vso46hJFfZSQaJE35wSs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stir Fry Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Chance for Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
