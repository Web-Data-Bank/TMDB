The ghost haunts this itinerary of places projecting its haunts as light in moving images. As an archaeologist, the ghost portrays the present to uncover the past layer by layer through cracks and reveals, exposing herself with her memories and of others who have come and gone before. During two years of shooting, the filmmaker visits the town she grew up in and the city she later lived in. Starting in the city’s historical peninsula, in the ruinous dungeons she asks ‘is there cinema after death?’ She then visits her childhood town to see her grandmother’s grave, her old family house and school. Filmed entirely with expired/old stock super 8mm film, handmade camera lenses and scratched film technique, the beams of light, dust and aged texture of the film compose the ghost in its emotional state.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/GHNmnw82vxq6hNcNDwvkBJ3t32.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was A Ghost Myself","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
