Expect heart-melting serenades, ridiculous disguises and a fairytale ending waiting just out of reach. From the barber’s opening number ‘Largo al factotum,’ with its cry of ‘Figaro!,’ to Rosina’s feisty aria ‘Una voce poco fa,’ Gioachino Rossini’s comic opera is a riotously entertaining affair. Rafael Payare makes his House debut, and joins Christopher Willis in conducting a cast that includes Andrzej Filończyk, Aigul Akhmetshina, Laurence Brownlee, Konu Kim and Bryn Terfel.","popularity":0.858,"poster_path":"/1aGPJP07aHYgSm6GfYqBwfd4q77.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Royal Opera House: The Barber of Seville","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
