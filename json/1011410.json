With more twists than a page boy’s stockings, the story of Mozart’s comic opera will surprise and delight you at every turn. Come for the music and stay for the cross-dressing hilarity, all unfolding over the course of one crazy, topsy-turvy day in the Almaviva household. Antonio Pappano conducts a truly international cast in David McVicar’s timeless production.","popularity":2.182,"poster_path":"/kjkf40J32qsWLNFpELytJPYiZvR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":215,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Royal Opera House: The Marriage of Figaro (2022/2023)","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
