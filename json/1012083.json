Using documentary footage, a journey into a cave, a dream recounted and formal strategies of color, sound and movement the ReStack’s push experiences and ideas together to see what can yield or reveal. The Sky’s In There proposes a fragmented meditation on the capacity of relation to bring about transformation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sky's In There","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
