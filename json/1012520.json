This is a road movie. this is a rock and roll drama, a tale that exposes the rumors surrounding a mythical festival tour (or is it just the drugs?). The cinematography is stunning, the drug taking shocking and the horror horrific, not for the faint hearted. It's a unique film capturing the true essence of the festival spirit, unlike any British film to date. This movie is the essence of a rock and roll nightmare. It's a must see for anyone who's been on the road.. and if you've not gone on tour before... after this you never will.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kKlvx3lcGl3Njnia13oAJCEnoQa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fish-pot Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"WHAT GOES ON TOUR STAYS ON TOUR.","title":"Rock And Roll Fuck 'n' Lovely","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
