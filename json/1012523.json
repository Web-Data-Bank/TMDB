Live At Firefest","overview":"For the very first time the UK / American AOR legends Strangeways can now finally be seen live in concert on DVD. Recorded at the reunion show at Firefest 2010 in front of an adoring crowd at Nottingham's Rock City, Terry, Ian, Jim, Munch and Warren combined some of the greatest AOR tracks ever written such as Love Lies Dying , Only A Fool and Never Going To Lose It with some brand new tracks from the comeback album Perfect World , such as the title track, Borderline and the monstrous Bushfires . For those that have waited 21 years, this is finally your chance to see the band in all their glory on stage for the first time since 1989, and re-live what was for band and fans a truly emotional homecoming in front of a sold out Rock City, Nottingham.
