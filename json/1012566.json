It is too early to die no matter how old you are, isn't it? Autumn. An old village in a Belarusian remote place. An elderly man is starting to objectify his fight... The director shows a portrait of the man through revealing his spirit, character, willpower in a single act while leaving the details of his life history off-screen as unnecessary. The action on the screen will provoke the viewer to put themselves in the main character’s shoes inviting them possibly to feel and/or possibly to realise their own lifetime limitation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ty5L10VycsLTPegd0cqMBYWIsV5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"}],"release_date":"2014-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"165/60","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
