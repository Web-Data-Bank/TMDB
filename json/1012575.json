In a venerable hotel an elevator gets stuck. The pregnant Irene, the receptionist Mia, the janitor Kristof, and the actress Liz are trapped. On a radio they hear the world outside collapsing. As hunger and thirst increase the elevator turns from safe haven to death trap. As they lose hope they let go of built-in defenses and get under each others skin. Kristof and Mia have a common past laden with betrayal and sorrow. Irene is married to a man who abuses her. Liz is torturing herself over the death of a child. Finally Irenes water breaks and there is no alternative but to cut the cable that holds the elevator and plunge towards an unknown fate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zDgeGjoRvhebO6vA6wGxxtPqjdM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2015-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beginning of the End","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
