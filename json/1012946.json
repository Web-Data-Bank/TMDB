An unofficial music video played to a same-titled track by Taiwanese 80s songstress Lin Ling, it tells the story of a tomboy who tries to change herself to please her boyfriend but is rejected by him for a more ladylike woman.  According to Jack Neo, the music video helped kickstart his interest in directing and was shot using a VHS camcorder that the MDC had acquired in 1985. The talents in the music video were his colleagues at the MDC and parts of the video were filmed at the former Central Manpower Base in Tanglin Camp on Dempsey Road.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being a Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
