Bill Nye explores the science of renewable energy and demonstrates how we can use science and technology to engineer a brighter tomorrow. Using his trademark blend of hands-on demos and humor, Bill explains Newton's First Law. Then, he's off to the Renewable Energy Lab at UL to compare renewable and non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels, solar, wind, and hydroelectricity. Scientists are working every day to develop new forms of renewable energy sources that are safe, efficient, and friendly to the planet. Energy sources that might one day eliminate our reliance on fossil fuels - now that's Safety Smart!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aPNXJoMEwH2xS8rfAxOEmySz5eC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safety Smart Science with Bill Nye the Science Guy: Renewable Energy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
