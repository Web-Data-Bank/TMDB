Through the statements of survivors, planners, politicians, psychologists, and community activists, the film explores the psychology of disaster, the importance of community, and the paradox of a poor people living in a rich land.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1cgKuXjLXWxRSI1oQEOUuipipXh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buffalo Creek Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
