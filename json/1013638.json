In the fifth inning, Carl Mays threw one of his \"submarine\" pitches that hit Ray Chapman in the head. Chapman collapsed at the plate. He was rushed to the hospital and died the next day, the only Major League Baseball player ever to be killed in a game. Grief tore through Cleveland and the pivotal moment led to an explosion on and off the field. The Indians, sparked by the addition of young shortstop Joe Sewell, recovered in time to win their first World Series Title. What resulted was a rivalry that would last 100 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rsqsGiqj5BqePrago0E1vBmE9DA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bronson Park Films","origin_country":""},{"id":180666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Come Aboard Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":180667,"logo_path":null,"name":"SMA Creative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Deadly Pitch That Launched a Rivalry","title":"War on the Diamond","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
