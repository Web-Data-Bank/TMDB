If we talk about blues as all this, then Vili Fajdiga's life was a typical blues one. At that time (1920), in Zasavje and Trbovlje, similar social conditions were evidently established as in the American Mississippi Delta, necessary for the birth of blues music. This is a story about a difficult and varied life, creativity, passion, hope, about falls and not always ups and downs, about love for a woman, for music, for life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/26uHgLpvYtVa795DhIrLBLTH7qJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Staragara","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black District Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
