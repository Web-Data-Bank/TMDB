After the death of her friend Robin Williams, Margaret Cho took to the streets of San Francisco with the mantra \"Don't grieve Robin, BE Robin.\" What started as Margaret busking on the corner with a bag of socks and a guitar case, rapidly turned into hundreds of musicians, comedians, and homeless advocates spreading food, clothes, money, and awareness in an amazing humanitarian street theater experience. The film that captured these events, is not only entertaining, but deeply moving and above all else inspiring.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"#BeRobin the Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
