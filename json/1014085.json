Gus invites him to a lamb-chop breakfast---not an appealing breakfast to begin with---and learns that the sound of a whistle sets bells ringing in Dick's head. Whistles, from one source or another, including Gus' wife who isn't all that thrilled about Dick coming to breakfast, start and Dick goes crazy. After a chase Gus is mistaken for the escaped insane man (Cy Shindell)from a local sanitarium and taken away by the doctors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pardon My Lamb Chop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
