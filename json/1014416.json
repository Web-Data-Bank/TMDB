Traditional ways of life eroded, and many families were forced to move away. Drawing on rare 8mm colour film of Berneray, directors Andy MacKinnon and Kirsty MacDonald offer a bridge between the contemporary citizens and their not-so-distant past. The result is a film of great emotion that speaks to the importance of place and the resilience of culture through language, song and memories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kzOMBMWr2HbNPDY3WbAKJO5uq6x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Gaelic","iso_639_1":"gd","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
