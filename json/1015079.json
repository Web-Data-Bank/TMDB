Together with his father, who doesn’t share their sight, they work as exorcists until one day his mother meets a tragic end, saving Iqbal from an attack by a particularly malevolent spirit. With his mother gone, Iqbal’s father attempts to end the family’s suffering by binding his son’s abilities by using a mystic, but it only half works. When Iqbal and his friends inadvertently unleash a very nasty spirit in a fit of adolescent abandon, he learns that his abilities aren’t completely gone... but are they strong enough to save the people he loves from a fate worse than death?","popularity":0.946,"poster_path":"/uWmlk74p14IV4SoDpckdqUhGjl1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Apparat","origin_country":""},{"id":163804,"logo_path":null,"name":"D'Ayu Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":21361,"logo_path":"/1nkM6TsM8LkCZGrprQotQR6oD3H.png","name":"Skop Productions Sdn.
