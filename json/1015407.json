An artist by the name of Jesús starts his morning getting off with a trick named Zeke, handcuffed to a wall while Zeke's girlfriend/pimp Jezzie waits in the living room. This is all before he goes to a kinky Christmas party at a place called The Cathedral that night where he meets the captivating M. Monroe. Their one night stand will be life and death (death and rebirth)! A sordid resurrection. At times, comedic, sexy and bold; at the core it's a love story: to receive love, one must BE love first.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d3nXIFKL7pyfFFkFNLZcwZmVXiz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.","title":"Jesús","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
