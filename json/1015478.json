On July 12 of that year, Taean Police Station massacred 115 civilians just before retreating from the 'fraudulent reality'. At that time, state power massacred these civilians only through the assumption that they would sympathize with the People's Army, which is about to occupy Taean. The damage in Taean didn't stop here. The People's Army, which occupied Taean, massacred 116 civilians on the grounds that it would punish the reaction. However, this was only a preview of the catastrophe that was to follow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j5IkApNdYLPMRRfhKqZZkz2HQ7n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taean","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
