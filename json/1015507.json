It’s home to a beautiful old Carnegie Library, a great little pretzel bakery and a number of bars and music clubs too. Come along as WQED’s Rick Sebak and his team give a tour of this part of town that’s divided into “flats” and “slopes.” Along the way, we check out some used book stores, visit the huge Terminal Buildings, look for stuff at T&T Hardware, stop for lunch at Cupka’s, take a dip in the Oliver Bathhouse, get a cone at Page Dairy Mart and a coffee at the Beehive. We even spend some time at a South Side Summer Street Spectacular (not there anymore since 2004.)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"South Side","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
