Nevertheless, even in a period like this, it is still men who control the fate of womankind. During that period, the celebrated poet, YU Jen falls for charms of SHAU Tao. However in the long run, he still does not wish to marry her due to her social status. Having a very high esteem for herself, SHAU Tao prefers to remain single for the rest of her life rather than make sacrifice to accommodate such a situation. The plot switches back and forth from the letters sent between SHAU Tao and YU Jen\\'s wife. The film reveals an undercurrent of a homoerotic relationship and the subtle relationship between three of them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hAALzkZ2035xxir25ly7gDfKuQw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fire Sky Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2001-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PROSTITUTES IN THE YEARS PAST - SHAU TAO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
