Siegfried is the third opera in Richard Wagner’s four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.  Wagner broke off composition at the end of Act II of Siegfried to write Tristan und Isolde and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, returning to Siegfried seven years later. Longborough Festival Opera, known as the British Bayreuth, calls on renowned Wagnerian Anthony Negus to conduct and Amy Lane to stage this new production of Siegfried in the bucolic English Cotswolds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fq8gcwnQJFy87PvSb7x1p2esob4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siegfried - LONGBOROUGH","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
