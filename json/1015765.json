They worshipped the Stooges and witnessed the Sex Pistols bring punk to the Great Plains, igniting within them an uncontrolled prairie fire to do-it-themselves. They threw a house-wrecking party and invited “a thousand loving friends” into their secret world of “weirdo new wave freaks” in Wichita and beyond. They played Chicago, D.C., and New York, drawing the attention of influential figures like Allen Ginsberg, John Cale, and Jonathan Demme — but their independence and refusal to sell out sparked tension within the group and kept mainstream success at bay. Through original interviews and restored concert footage, this documentary shows how the Embarrassment rose out of nowhere to become a post-punk legend that's almost been forgotten — until now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4u5gHAv5fzuD27DiO8n8NUNTzp2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70119,"logo_path":"/4jsFTRafuGrdoMlD3XGTqFd4Wgh.png","name":"Factory 25","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ignited by punk’s invasion of the Great Plains, America’s gawkiest and greatest lost rock band battles conformity in Reagan-era Kansas.","title":"We Were Famous, You Don't Remember: The Embarrassment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
