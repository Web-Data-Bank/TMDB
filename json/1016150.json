She had the opportunity to see and touch Jesus Christ and she is in love with him, but for some reason he decided to disappear living her in a mood of anguish and despair. This love for God and the desperate attempt to have him back leads her to a self-destructing behavior: she lays in dirty places surrounded by rats, she whips her back and scream and so on. Her friend, sister Chiara, suggests her to stop behaving like that, to calm down and try to look for God in the harmony of Nature. Sister Margherita accepts her advice and she spent some time in the woods: after a nap she starts hearing scary voices, then she reach a lake and she understand that God himself is calling her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/owdBYFkALhbyuOvMbIL0smeDPJy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125835,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Oaks Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":181051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Director's Cut Picture","origin_country":""},{"id":125833,"logo_path":"/gyJ6pwIwv23eVLk6XSnDPYLI2Xv.png","name":"Materiali Sonori Cinema","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margherita","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
