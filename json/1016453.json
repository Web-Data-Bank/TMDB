Situated 26 miles from Baton Rouge, it may not be the grandest of plantations, but what it lacks in presentation, it makes up for in disturbing history and lore. Owned by the Moss family, it's touted as one of the most haunted places in America. Visitors have reported seeing apparitions, lights turning on and off, faces and handprints in mirrors, vanishing objects; hearing random footsteps, rattling doorknobs, children's cries, and unexplained smells. The Myrtles Plantation has been featured on \"Ghost Hunters,\" \"Ghost Adventures,\" Unsolved Mysteries\" and \"Most Terrifying Places in America.\" But is this plantation the paranormal hotspot it's claimed to be? Does it hold the dark and tragic history of poisonings, hangings, mutilation, murder, and gunfire claimed? Can fact be separated from fiction? Ericka and her team are about to find out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wDNWpnoDZAN4oMQwII2DUEFuWWt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Second Sight Paranormal TV Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Myrtles Plantation: Murder, Mystery, and Magic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
