Cuba is one of the main signatories of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, signed on 20 November 1989, when the country had already made extraordinary progress in protecting the rights of the child, in comparison to developed countries, such as the United States, which as of today hasn't yet ratified the Convention.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gvztx5Rfe7UP8ztDB6roGnMowg5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Resumen Latinoamericano","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"2019-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Voice of Innocence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
