Not only do bones support the body, they also serve to store and release minerals that the body needs, such as calcium and phosphorus. In addition, bones are constantly being broken down and reformed, and this is controlled by vitamin D and other hormones. Vitamin D works on the cells that create bone to promote bone formation. The bones that these cells build support life itself.
