According to producers Santiago Roig and Etam Paese, Mislanded, The Air Disaster is a slap in the face of the sameness found in many films available on the market and brings a lot of action, as well as a disturbed view of the world.  The film features experts in aerial maneuvers such as Fábio Mr. Burns, Etam Paese, Rodrigo “Generik”, Heitor Alves, Marcelo Trekinho, and foreigners like Joe Crimo and Christian Fletcher, in a frenetic mix of disaster and fun that includes scenes with beggars, parties, plane crashes, among other oddities.  The soundtrack features bands such as Motorhead, Alexisonfire, Silvestein among others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jXXaVbwSLQClMxAf37RdrXz659T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mislanded: The Air Disaster","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
