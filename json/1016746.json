Beirut is mentioned, evoked through the driver’s stories and through sound, but never seen, invisible in overexposed whiteness. However, the presence of Beirut is confirmed through the ongoing discourse. Like his driving, Mroué’s stories spin in a circle. He is like a ghost, haunting the streets of a city where a reconstruction project is in progress in a strange postwar period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rounds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
