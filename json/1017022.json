Highlighting the fantasies we construct and investigating the relationship between exploration and exploitation, the film draws into focus how these romanticised stages are in fact borders of conquest, annexed for geopolitical territory appropriation and mineral resources.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Common Heritage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
