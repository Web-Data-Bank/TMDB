No one knows exactly why, but it is impossible to go outside. A couple is forced to live with an unknown family while the world beyond the windows of their house seems to disintegrate forever. But the biggest threat of all might be inside, in the exact center of the dining room table. Or at the bottom of the nightstand drawer. Or in the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5rc88osc9QsFpcQVHseNYqX5OXo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133785,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prointel","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":114310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isla Audiovisual","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La alarma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
