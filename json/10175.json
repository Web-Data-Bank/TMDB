One of the more extreme communes, the Taylor-Eriksson cult, carries its \"quest for self-knowledge\" to a malevolent end, with numerous group members trapped, tortured, murdered and mutilated. Tears of Kali tells their twisted and disturbing story. Mathieu Carriere, Peter Martell, Cora Chilcott, Vronie Kiefer, and Nuran Celik head the ensemble cast.","popularity":1.55,"poster_path":"/qVARY9zCCXw4kETRDlwdj26jo7z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cut and Run Production","origin_country":""},{"id":193692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mainland Media","origin_country":""},{"id":193693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sterling Screen Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":69249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lopta Film","origin_country":""},{"id":193694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reduta Berlin","origin_country":""},{"id":193695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Kitsune Berlin","origin_country":""},{"id":28957,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anolis Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":98784,"logo_path":null,"name":"CG Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":193697,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flamingo Video (IT)","origin_country":""},{"id":193582,"logo_path":null,"name":"IPA Asia Pacific","origin_country":""},{"id":4383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maverick Entertainment Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Revolver Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":193698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ascot Elite Home Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":102314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selecta Visi√≥n","origin_country":""},{"id":193699,"logo_path":null,"name":"e-m-s the DVD-Company","origin_country":""},{"id":4207,"logo_path":"/v5BSFwIXQmZEO16bClILNrbv4Kl.png","name":"Sahamongkolfilm","origin_country":"TH"},{"id":40275,"logo_path":null,"name":"SBP Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Evil has found its way out","title":"Tears of Kali","video":false,"vote_average":5.125,"vote_count":12}
