Filmed in the beautiful natural environment of the wetlands in The Netherlands. With increasing population numbers amongst the otter, they look for new territory to expand. The Province works to protect them on a large scale, by for instance blocking roads with gauze, and creating fauna-tunnels. There's still a long way to go until a full recovery, but the otter is showing us the right track.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rPzzZiQrjbiukusyXh0ufeMJ32Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albatros Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":107563,"logo_path":"/x42HkwWO4sOYSekXbl3LKxRz2Wo.png","name":"EO","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":139324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ispida Wildlife Production","origin_country":""},{"id":181287,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hilco Jansma Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The otter, a legend returns","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
