To be neighbourly the two families propose a dinner, where Delilah’s intentions become clearer as she suggests they sneak off alone. While apprehensive, Freddie obliges. The girl’s absence concerns Xanthia, Delilah’s conservative and protective mother, who goes to find them. She walks in on the girls drawing on each other’s hands, they startle and separate, suggesting to Xanthia their intentions went further. Confronted and upset, Xanthia causes a scene, Delilah confronts her mother and Freddie watches on. Delilah explains her feelings, but afraid, Freddie throws Delilah under the bus exclaiming her feelings aren’t mutual. Later realising what she has done, Freddie paints a gesture for Delilah, and Xanthia concedes to mend her relationship with her daughter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l5eUSr5w1eXoRSXtSXBeuh7QYfS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"For queer kids, for their parents.","title":"Freddie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
