The public uproar caused by the campaign led the heads of the banks, the attorney's office and the police to try to stop the activity of Barak and his friends in any way possible. The culmination of this attempted silencing was the \"trial of the bankers\" which included serious charges, as if taken from the world of organized crime. Barak and his friends did not panic and turned the trial into a serious indictment against the heads of the banking system, a move that was hailed as a resounding success and has since inspired all civil struggles in Israel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nxxATIvnTQWxOWhfoNPNS4MSzpT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pardes Films","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2022-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Going for their Heads","title":"The Bankers Trial","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
