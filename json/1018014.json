Liggett. Filmed over the course of 20 years, this documentary is an unfiltered look into the unbelievable and unapologetic life M.T. lived.  We began this film in college in 2002 as a thesis project for a documentary class at the University of Kansas. Over the next 20 years, we painstakingly filmed hundreds of hours of footage and audio to ensure we told the real story of M.T. Liggett. The challenges we faced during this production were many, but I am certain as a friend of M.T. myself, he would be proud of this film. I cannot wait for audiences to see it. Thank you.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/diMzl6QTtOKHH9zAVvTfiZ5EFAz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Only You Can Make You Mad","title":"It Started with a Horse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
