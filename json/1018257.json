But it's all going to be fine. Instead of getting the therapy he clearly needs, he's made a cracking show about it. He's lost enough weight to almost get his wedding ring off and, while he may be flying solo, he's far from alone; he's got his grown-up daughters, his dogs and his divorce lawyer. The fickle finger of fate has turned Hal's life upside down but he's sticking a finger right back at it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qTfUWL3GWeMi3xm4X7luEiYs7F6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100057,"logo_path":null,"name":"NextUp","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hal Cruttenden: It's Best You Hear It From Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
