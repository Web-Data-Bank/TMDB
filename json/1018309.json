A welterweight bout between Khamzat Chimaev and former lightweight title challenger (also The Ultimate Fighter 5 lightweight winner) Nate Diaz was originally expected to headline the event. However at the weigh-ins, Chimaev weighed in at 178.5 pounds, 7.5 pounds over the welterweight non-title limit and the bout was cancelled. As a result, the organization opted to shuffle a trio of fights: a new main event featuring Diaz against former interim UFC Lightweight Champion (also The Ultimate Fighter: Team Lesnar vs. Team dos Santos welterweight winner) Tony Ferguson, who was originally scheduled to face Li Jingliang in a welterweight bout, was then set.","popularity":4.09,"poster_path":"/aUxvsLaFJsqbFWFIC4cgnB5exD1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72685,"logo_path":"/pGU8jiv3XnHPVKUR3bBIirB8XjG.png","name":"Ultimate Fighting Championship","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UFC 279: Diaz vs. Ferguson","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
