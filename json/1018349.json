Featuring stories from across the AA/PI experience, Stories Within showcases 14 individuals who speak to their younger selves about the acts of racism and discrimination they’ll face as well as sharing messages of empowerment to bring with them to the present. The film shatters the notion of homogenous experiences and backgrounds across the AA/PI diaspora­ and highlights the indelible mark that they have made not just on the sociocultural fabric of the United States, but also of Texas specifically.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jyVpHAtmOAqh2DqcWgqLuAzgoXX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stories Within","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
