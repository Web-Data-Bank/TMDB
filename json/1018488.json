They discuss their differing tastes, definitions of class, frogs, and other qualifiers they consider in their evaluation of the space that they live in: a suburban-like outcropping of identical housing units. Through direct quotation and phenomenological relation to Bill Greavesâ€™ seminal film, Still A Brother: Inside the Negro Middle Class (1968), 71 navigates the temporal gaps in conformity and respectability politics between 1968 and 2022.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yHF4bI7Q0TE2gMKJAmcZ04kzijU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"71","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
