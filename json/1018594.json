Maggie, now an adult, doesn’t remember those events and doesn’t believe her father’s book. But when she inherits the old family home after her father’s death, she starts to question if there’s more to the house than she believed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2575,"logo_path":"/9YJrHYlcfHtwtulkFMAies3aFEl.png","name":"21 Laps Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":34,"logo_path":"/GagSvqWlyPdkFHMfQ3pNq6ix9P.png","name":"Sony Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Home Before Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
