Upon his return home, he committed suicide, leaving behind nearly twenty hours of video diaries recorded over nine months as evidence of his actions. The diaries not only captured the building of the letter bomb, but also López's personal thoughts on his life, his family, and his sanity. Twenty years after these diaries were discovered, they shock and fascinate curious viewers in an online world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k246I9vImsmPdlzbcCd8Wzl3ThS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89763,"logo_path":null,"name":"Method M Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is for you.","title":"The best of me.MP4","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
