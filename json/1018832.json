His wife Diane, abused in childhood, depressed, drinking and fearful, files unfounded charges of abuse and David's world shatters. Evicted, friendless, and emotionally battered, his career crumbles and the courts bar him from his children. David's struggle to rebuild his life carries him to brilliant psychiatrist, Rebecca Miller. She nurtures abused children but conceals her own shadowy secrets. Katherine Avery, gifted, idiosyncratic Downtown artist, offers David a refuge and shares her bed, but she'll sacrifice anything for success - even love. Despondent, David is drawn to cyber sex by submissive Internet incarnation, Sublimate. She uncovers his darkest fantasies but frees him to take control of his own life. When his Web fantasy woman enters his real life, the truth, especially about himself, becomes startlingly clear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kzGnQGRYu7zgVyfKkMSnniG0dts.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A love story for the grownup in all of us","title":"Absolute Trust","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
