Lewin takes you into the world of Sacred Hearts. The following footage was captured in May of 2022 in the aims of creating a five minute documentary for a university assignment. After realising hours of footage was captured, E.C. Lewin decided a more comprehensive version of this story needed to be told. This is the definitive version of “Glamour Girls” with Lewin and Maddie Lefebvre using an additional shoot in June, as well as archival footage to tell the in-depth story. Following June, Josie and Bella as they navigate and influencer the resurgence of goth within the  Meanjin (Brisbane) underground music scene, “Glamour Girls” is testament to the impact and necessity of passion within artistic circles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xNtWDfyaMRkDukfUVL35AUlKfg8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92871,"logo_path":null,"name":"Queensland University of Technology","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"be passionate or die","title":"Glamour Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
