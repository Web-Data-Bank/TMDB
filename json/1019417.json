Inspired by France's Grand Guignol style of horror theatre, and utilizing a lyrical language both visual and verbal to capture the strange poetry of the Mojave land and soundscape, Serpentine Pink follows a reclusive biker woman and her John Wayne-obsessed exotic dancer lover's disturbing fallout after a violent acid attack. An ethereal psychic and her aspiring healer companion converge with supernatural forces in an attempt to confront and then heal the women's - as well as their own - deep-rooted, personal pain that comes from trying to break the cycle of possessive love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vSihHZdrQ3wHKvMwC3qbgBOUiFg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hard Knock Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":144518,"logo_path":null,"name":"1157 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love is a wild animal","title":"Serpentine Pink","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
