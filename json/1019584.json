She was worrying about entering junior high school. After spending a few days with her, I returned to my city but promised her to come back again when I parted. Two years later, I decided to go back and look for her based on the limited information in my hand. With her mother and sister going out to work, the family economy has improved, but new problems have swept across the face-the popularization of 12-year compulsory education has made her no longer worry about enrolling in middle and high schools, but because of her poor grades, she may be forced to marry Be a woman.  13-year-old Droma strives to improve her studies in a remote Chinese village. She knows that if she doesn’t, she’ll be forced into a traditional role as a housewife and mother.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/odkr5FXeZWcYEdmobE551jwr8ht.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
