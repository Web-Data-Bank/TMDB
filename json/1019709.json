Dorothy melting the Wicked Witch of the West. A bruised and battered Rocky crying out 'A-DRI-AN!' Thelma and Louise flying off a Grand Canyon cliff in their airborne T-Bird. From our seat in the darkened theater, movies have miraculously transported us to other places, other times, other worlds. We've followed Indiana Jones on his quest for the lost ark, fallen in love with Ingrid and Marilyn and Meg, and battled a fiery Balrog in Middle Earth.The images emanating from the big screen have seared these moments into our hearts and imaginations, becoming memories that last a lifetime. Nearly everyone can name a favorite film and any number of beloved scenes, and Now Showing: Unforgettable Moments from the Movies makes it possible to relive those special movie memories again and again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Now Showing: Unforgettable Moments from the Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
