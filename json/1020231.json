Thaterʼs subject matter was simple and the use of structural methods helped to articulate the medium of video projection. Thater created a jewel box with footage of Monetʼs garden broken into the primary video colors. The image was not broken apart in post-production but inside the Barco projector. Also critical to the work was Thater addressing the existing architecture of the gallery. She allowed the outside to be present and turned the window into a front and rear screen. The viewer was present, often being projected upon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wBSNigdhd1pRPMGc0NZ161GQBJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oo Fifi, Five Days In Claude Monet's Garden, Part 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
