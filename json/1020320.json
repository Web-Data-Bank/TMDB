Though Lew French first appears as unyielding and imposing as the granite he works with, beneath this artist’s rigid exterior is a naturalist who has spent two decades building his dream home in the Brazilian rainforest, a father mourning the loss of his son, and a deeply spiritual man committed to the concept of karma. Despite waking up at 4am to meditate every day, Lew struggles to quiet his mind. In stone, Lew finds that which he longs for: stillness. As one of Lew’s friends puts it, “Don’t be tricked by the idea that he’s a stone mason. He’s sort of a philosopher, artist, spiritual guide who’s working with stone.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":133044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salt and Sugar Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":181725,"logo_path":null,"name":"Morse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Power of Stone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
