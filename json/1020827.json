The present film has followed those visually challenged actors through different phases of practising theatre. Also, this documentary captures a few scenes of Rabindranath Tagore's play “Raktakarabi” (Red Oleanders), being staged by those visually challenged performers. This is a tribute to an incredible tale of human achievement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kuRBFtAYHurasHRxTG8tW2CWvWL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2022-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8th Day of the Week","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
