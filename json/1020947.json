It was forbidden to mention his name during the years of the Soviet occupation. Only after Latvia regained its independence, his descendants found his autobiography, which reads like a last letter to the future Latvia. This film is dedicated to the inception of the Latvian state and the centenary of its Constitution and Parliament.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studija Centrums","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fridrihs Vesmanis.
