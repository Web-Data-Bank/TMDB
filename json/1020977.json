Derek is a successful musician in Paris and the single dad of a 14-year-old girl named Skyler who is smart, funny, and studious and who has recently been testing the boundaries set by her father. Casey is a lawyer and a married mother of three in Toronto and is quite comfortable setting limits, though her eldest, 14-year-old Luca is constantly crossing them. Both Derek and Casey spontaneously decide to surprise their own parents at their recently constructed ‘forever home’ in rural Ontario but encounter each other instead. Casey and Derek are happy to see each other, but the teenaged cousins —who have barely seen each other over the years (and never really liked what they saw)— don’t get along at all, uniting only to get into serious trouble.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hWpWGWN6RPxXkbrNkSo33pXqpxw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6252,"logo_path":"/9b3MKk54TG6p059z0t9j4bqgnom.png","name":"Shaftesbury Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life With Luca","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
