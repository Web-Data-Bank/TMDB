We meet several groups: The Bigfoot Society, a cell of true believers; the American Hominid Association (AHA), a government funded band of trackers; and the Michigan Cryptozoological Institute, a cult-like organization devoted to welcoming the Sasquatch-American into western society. These and other characters cross paths and eventually converge at an impromptu festival, dubbed \"Bigfoot Bonanza\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4wzgsTA4TZrpPn8NkWcdsh7HCWk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They're Out There ...","title":"The Sasquatch Hunters","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
