Within the realms of Ruijing’s discussions, she hopes for the work to push the boundaries of the marginality of the body, for the work to allow oneself to look at their and others’ body in an objective manner that escapes the ontological. She further wished for the experience of living and the reflection on the mass would help the discovery of the self and its connection with society, while reflecting on life itself by doing so.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nxLectkkPHe0oGiTNnWORISjLXz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RODENTS’ BODY EXPLORATION","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
