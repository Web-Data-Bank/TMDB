The rather bizarre solution she comes up with is to conceive a child behind her boyfriend’s back. Makoto Nagahisa offers the much more impressionistic “Frog.” The story meanders around a bunch of unrelated characters, using experimental techniques like repeated scenes, hallucinatory visuals, blurred shots and disconnected sounds. Lastly, we have “Bouquet Garni,” a much more conventional work from director Junpei Hatano. The plot is centered on a reporter, the relative of a kidnapping victim, and a woman who is obsessed with the case.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pfdgcYjA34dH3fnkccq9EXVYXWz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181791,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cornflakes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero nendai zenkei","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
