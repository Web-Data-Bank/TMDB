A prophecy written by the people since the Five Dynasties Northern Song Dynasty is said to be the proverb of the Tiangongshan Zhigong, Huagong, Yigong, Tanggong and Baogong Wugong Bodhisattvas. The salvation people were robbed at the end, often used by rural secret social organizations, and also banned by the imperial court rulers. The belief in the \"Five Annals\" in the rural society of northwestern Yunnan has abandoned the function of politics, and only pays attention to the practical effect of the Wugong sutra curse on treating and saving people and protecting one side. This film is a field survey of the Wugong sutra as a folk belief in rural society in northwestern Yunnan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dtGJm7sxAJMYw9wJoA8V7qxp9iO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WUGONG SUTRA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
