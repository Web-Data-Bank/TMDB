And along with it, the names of its two authors - Ada Rybachuk and Volodymyr Melnichenko, were erased from the history of art. For many years this story has been kept in the strictest confidence and is known only to a narrow circle of the creative elite. All attempts by the authors to achieve justice and to be heard, just lead to even greater resistance from the authorities against them. Their names are gradually crossed out under all major works, from the lists of Ukrainian artists, and to top it off. In 2004, their studio was illegally written off and tried to be taken away. For 8 years, the film crew has been watching how this story develops, the courage of Vladimir, who, despite his old age and other difficulties, continues his struggle, in the name of Ada and their joint creativity, and how he, with the participation of a new generation, achieves colossal results.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rsplnTjlN9EkqgAeKj87YFSYNXS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ADA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
