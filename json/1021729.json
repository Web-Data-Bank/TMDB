Each of the teenagers in these games forgets about the problems in their family. But adult reality is slowly creeping up on each of them. A reality where dads are fighting with each other for a place in the sun or just getting drunk. And mothers, in pursuit of their fate, sometimes forget about the little ten-year-old happiness left at home. And children who do not know how to pray like birds pray for the happiness of their mother and for the love of their parents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7KysPxMm6vY2w9rcJv62gA74ZKM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KG","name":"Kyrgyz Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kirghiz","iso_639_1":"ky","name":"??????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scent of the Wormwood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
