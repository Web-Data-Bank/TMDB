Shot in Scotland, England, Barbados, Sierra Leone and Italy, the film melds a collection of scenes that give focus to the strength of contemporary Black womxn, whose individual acts of resistance are bound together through the artist’s conceptual storytelling. The artist situates Black love in proximity with historical sites of trauma, re-inscribed with rage, hope and exhaustion. Gestures, rituals and moments of intimacy are poignantly underpinned by a deep reflection on grief, loss and mourning, a resolute reminder of the trauma inflicted upon the Black body and of white privilege and power.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ea4qEostPt6lzXRQG9YAD0L42Sm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"deep dive (pause) uncoiling memory","title":"Lagareh - The Last Born","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
