This movie proves that there must be something in the water, literally, of this Hawaiian island that breeds world-class surfers. Bruce, Andy, Dustin Barca, Kamalei Alexander, Reef Macintosh, Adam Guy and Chava are just a few of the boys holding it down in macking barrels and outrageous free-surf sessions.\r Just for kicks, Kelly Slater, Mick Fanning, Sunny Garcia, Taj Burrow, Joel Parkinson and Cory Lopez join the fun from Tahiti to Pipe to Indo, while Bruce and Andy steal the show. Crossing The Line serves notice that the younger of the Irons brothers is ready for his moment in the competitive spotlight!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2pop0aNBdPl7NlthbCnZgBDTugp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grass Shack","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crossing the Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
