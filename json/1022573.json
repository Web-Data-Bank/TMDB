The film uses this idea in the context of how an artificial intelligence might work: the AI generates optimal solutions to user problems as a form of desire line calculation. The film aims to interrogate the increasingly controversial role of Artificial Intelligence by visualising a statement from a bot about its experience on a Valentine's Day in the near future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v8tmmx7ikzevZtwE0NUwPNuG2RJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DESIRE LINE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
