After a ten-year hiatus, Takuma is attempting a comeback with a very personal project, a straight-up actioner for which he’s already got the ideal location in mind: a shut-down factory on a deserted island with zero cell phone coverage. Once they arrive on the spot though, the island turns out to be a little less deserted than expected. Two rivaling gangs of yakuza sought out a quiet little place to peacefully massacre each other all the while looking for two millions dollars’ worth of cocaine that was hidden somewhere on the island. If the majority of the film crew is shitting their pants out of pure, undiluted fear, Takuma is overjoyed and sees lots of extras in his movie to beat up for free in front of a rolling camera!","popularity":0.638,"poster_path":"/1FhhWzyMJB1DaegiDFrx1q7g1Ap.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One-Percenter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
