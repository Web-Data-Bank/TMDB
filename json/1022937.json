How can theatre question reality when faced with the primary actors of the story told on stage? The intense, cathartic, active answer of the Rwandan audience brings to the fore the current concerns of the survivors. What is life like for them 10 years after the genocide? Echoing the issues in the play, \"Rwanda. Through us humanity...\" allows the survivors of the genocide to speak out, in their current reality, during this special period of mourning. The memory of the genocide is sought out, is established through the traumatic awakenings, the evocations, the disinterment and dignified burial of victims, the fears and worries with regard to the threats that still weigh upon them today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vdYiuSB4CTJjINGVHHT7HSbNV08.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RW","name":"Rwanda"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rwanda, à travers nous l'humanité","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
