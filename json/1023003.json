Laura Grisi travelled across the world\r throughout the 1960s. During her travels, she recorded the\r image and sound of the wind. These various winds make up\r the subject of this film. During the -Teatro delle Mostre\"(La\r Tartaruga Gallery: Rome) collective exhibition in May 1968,\r Laura Grisi artificially reconstructed one of these winds.\r The film ends with this sequence, in which we see visitors\r immersed in this installation, experiencing this confrontation\r with the elements of nature for themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z6DCFiuoKyD5N9DLEf62pALpwtk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wind Speed 40 Knots","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
