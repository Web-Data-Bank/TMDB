In this release, we are up to our old tricks, turning it up a few notches. Nothing is sacred as we race and terrorize the streets leaving only a wake of car parts, rubber, and debris in our path. In an all-out effort to keep ahead of the ever-changing street racing scene we forge ahead with our crews drifting in and out of tracks and parking lots. This is the real deal on real streets with our crew of dedicated drivers and their beasts. Remember Hyper-Street Racing is the voice of the people! From the streets, we venture onto the tracks and the highways! An endless procession of tuners, drifters, and racers steaming forward into the days and nights always on point, always ready for the challenge, and eager to face danger at the risk of our own lives and our cars!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wGYp4Dc2mlE2NcKs2VPQXtaDYI2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mischief: Hyper Street Racing - Type B","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
