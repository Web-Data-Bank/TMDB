Highly symbolic, it celebrates the beauty of the imagination and impossible dreams that come true, the effort that goes into them, the wait, the joy at last. It's a film about songs that is openly inspired by Werner Herzog's masterpiece Fitzcarraldo and revisits the choir \"Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares\", here in the form of a colorful troupe of dancers from Romagna.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La nave sul monte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
