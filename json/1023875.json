Each episode follows a different character as they navigate an important moment in their romantic life - be it saying I love you for the first time, overcoming a small conflict in a long term relationship, or giving in to the possibility of a brand new one. Our focus is always on the positive, euphoric joy of love - with our cast overcoming whatever challenges they might face, to find themselves more confident and happy in themselves and their relationships.","popularity":0.647,"poster_path":"/g5ADW2yznLsTrlF1dXDEqapAwHR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29608,"logo_path":"/hfN4ipPEuJCU94gL8VOGIF0YixG.png","name":"Woo Films","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life in Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
