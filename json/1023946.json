Featuring bits about growing up in New York, the material is neither profane nor squeaky clean – but has a slice of life element obviously lacking in the cuddly Carlin of the '60s. There’s a gold star moment of longhaired George mocking a cardboard cutout of the suit and tie version, and so take-em-or-leave-them musical appearances by BB King and Kris Kristofferson. Certainly, worth a modern glance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pQTEcnQYOoFGABdKrxwiHNZnjkS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George Carlin: The Real George Carlin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
