This film is a question about the reality of the existing epistemology, order and system, reality, and so on. The question is about the facts that we have overlooked. Using archival footage, the work consists of documentaries on manufacturing process of electronics, advertisements for electronics, and images of incinerating the ‘e-waste’ in the Third World. These scenes are identified with a structure in which low-resolution digital images are dispersed and fragmented on the Internet in flexible temporalities. The work explores meaning and methodology of filmmaking in the digital environment using digital production tools and digital archival images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8PwbIPVNkNlmqSdNwrtt3pt2aHx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swarm Circulation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
