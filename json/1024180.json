The film uses a variety unconventional image making and hand-printing strategies to achieve its hi-contrast jittery style including contact printing with a mag-light taped to a sync block and hand-processing in a bucket. No conventional motion picture processes/tools/labs were used. The film is meant to be played/looped at 24fps with the soundtrack provided by the image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4STsnYAca4fHff0HXohGFGfTLBf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ENOLAEMEVAEL/LEAVEMEALONE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
