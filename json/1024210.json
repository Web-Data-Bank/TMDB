Jackpot! Adrian and his clique are lured into an “Escape Room Adventure”. But the supposedly harmless recreational fun turns out to be a perfidious behavioural analysis experiment conducted by two scientists. In order to be able to tailor the games exactly to the strengths, weaknesses and characteristics of the clique, they have programmed an AI. And this starts to play the friends off against each other and confront them with their deepest fears – a fight to the death begins.","popularity":1.583,"poster_path":"/eysGwKUM9ME7xzF80A7hlWXBbgh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Social Experiment","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
