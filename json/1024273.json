It is not clear how they obtained their superpowers. What is certain is that it is also not an ability that can be used easily. There is a fatal flaw in Jang-ah's superpower seal wind, which occurs for just one hour after drinking 88 Coke. After one shot, you have to rest for 10 seconds. The same goes for Chi-Cheong's superpowers. His power is healing power, but he only needs to rub his palms to the point of burning them in order to show that power. The two of them go somewhere with only the original plan that Jang-ah will attack and defend, and Chi-chung will heal him if he gets hurt. Even after they have superpowers, their hard-to-do action drama begins! Not superheroes, but foolish psychics. In fact, each of us may be making our own superheroes day by day, using our own superpowers that no one knows about.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A5ZMZzUtW7W2wY7VshFN4jbpNJH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jangah & Chichung","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
