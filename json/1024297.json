They called it Burgoo. No one knows where the name comes from, but the folks in Western Kentucky around Owensboro declare that the authentic and historical burgoo has to be made with mutton, or mature sheep. Folks in central Kentucky prefer beef or wild game. But one thing becomes very clear – the passion for whatever is called Burgoo, cooked in huge black iron cauldrons, is reflected in the titles given to the burgoo masters- they are called “Burgoo Kings”! And their reputations last beyond their years, as loyal stew masters rigorously maintain recipes and cooking traditions generation to generation. And along with making Burgoo comes a lot of leg-pulling, tall tales, and fellowship around the pot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burgoo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
