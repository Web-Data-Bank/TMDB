Children learn that they can live without air conditioning and television. During the day, they engage in water fights or make numerous visits to the \"store,\" where cold pineapple sherbet is sold. Grownups sit in lawn chairs in the front or back of their \"tent\" and talk about the latest news, how the children are growing up and what has happened since the last camp meeting. And there is plenty of food. Everyone prepares an abundant supply of their best recipes. Nightly preaching is scheduled at the tabernacle, a large, open structure with a tin roof, wooden benches and a gravel floor. Many a young child has kicked the gravel there to watch the dust fly and then been admonished by a watchful mom or dad, in some cases both.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cattle Creek Camp Part 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
