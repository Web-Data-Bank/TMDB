If you mention it, folks in surrounding states are likely to give you a blank stare. It’s closely related to chicken pilau (or pilaf or perlo), except that it’s … well, boggier. It’s moister than chicken perlo, which is more common in Georgetown County, just to the south of Horry County. The name “bog” probably comes from the wetness of the dish, although some speculate that it may come from the bogginess of the area where it is popular.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicken Bog of the Pee Dee Region","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
