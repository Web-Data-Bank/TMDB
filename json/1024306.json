Despite being manifestly unfit to govern, he overcomes each obstacle in his way to seize the crown, as King Richard III. But as those around him turn against him, and as his plans begin to unravel, where else can he turn as the Lancastrian opposition returns to drag the country into battle once more and put an end to Richardâ€™s tyrannical rule. Richard III is a savagely comic analysis of the exercise of power, reminding us of the dangers of tyranny and our duty not to let it go unchecked.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rRNt6POGQTtEBqqymolV4T1WJAf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal Shakespeare Company","origin_country":""},{"id":139109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trafalgar Releasing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Royal Shakespeare Company: Richard III","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
