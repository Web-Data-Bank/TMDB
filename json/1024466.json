This is the story of a family...  This is the story of my disabled brother...  In fact, I think it's the story of a storm...  I was 11 when my brother was born.  It was August 30, 1977.  It was the first time I saw my father cry.  It was necessary to pray and above all, to be very wise.  That's when my dad stopped talking and my mom stopped laughing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7u58wYfqBMMc5sCVrE2FvqdBArh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20181,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coop Vidéo de Montréal","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
