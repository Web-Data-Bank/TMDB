Camp meetings were held nearby as early as 1810. The present ten-acre site for an annual camp ground dates from 1838 and its buildings from a decade later. In the center sits an open-air tabernacle for the revival services. Ninety-nine wooden “tents” circle the tabernacle. These cabins generally have an upper story for sleeping and a downstairs for food preparation and eating and porches for socializing. A tent gets handed down from generation to generation in member white families. The Indian Tent camp meetings are scheduled for the first week in October.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indian Field Camp Meeting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
