Made during isolation in early 2020 this film evolved from a personal ritual, meditating upon a stone through repetitive drawing, bringing one back into the intimate interior world of the self as a place for rest and reflection. The Stone compiles 80 drawn studies made during this time, then filmed on the windows of four temporary homes inhabited in isolation during the early days of the pandemic. These drawings, threaded together incidentally and combined with layers of film from time previously spent across contients breathed life into a stone, and an animation blossomed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
