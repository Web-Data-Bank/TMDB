Although starring \"real people\", it is in fact an \"animated film\" in the true sense of the word. A \"stage\" pulled out by the simultaneous forces of infinite expansion and infinite collapse. Eight \"puppets\" pulled by the \"stage\". Two \"puppets\" with broken strings that appear and disappear. They pull each other's hair, trying to get rid of the \"stage\". They can't do anything. The constant repetition of frustration only strengthens their urge to get rid of the \"stage\". Also, although you don't need to wear any glasses, you can watch this movie as a real 3D or VR movie. Take off the \"glasses\" you were born with and maybe \"you\" can \"discover\" something from this \"world\". \"A little something","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pRinxhl1nieLRBQbxNc1OHcJf6K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":166,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE THE (166 MINUTES)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
