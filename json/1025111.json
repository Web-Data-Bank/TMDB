Both films were shot suddenly. The difference between the two is: \"How Far Are We From the Madhouse?\" was specially made for Yang Haisong, to make up for his guilt that I never used his music even though he suggested it many times. And \"Inner Ear Inflammation\" is 100% black-hearted private goods. Although the filming and production were completed in a very short time, it by no means means that it was sloppy. In fact, \"Inner Ear Inflammation\" is by far the least regretful of all the video works I've done, including feature films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aaPb3rwuSiZ5VR5lkMk9wFTUB9A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"#Music, #Experimental","title":"INNER EAR INFLAMMATION","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
