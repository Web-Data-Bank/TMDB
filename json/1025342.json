Through the lives and beliefs of four generations of preachers, the film reflects on the profound influence of 50 years of social change on the local church. Whether recounting personal setbacks encountered on the serving path or people’s weaknesses, growth, or disputes within the church community, the film becomes a neutral and faithful portrayal of a group of preachers, of the history of the church community and of the status-quo of belief in this faithless era.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5mBciTu6HVY4Sx9JNV5JZnUkp4R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PREACHERS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
