Born and raised in the late Soviet Ukraine, she sees her life predictable and clear. But it doesn't last long. Suddenly, she discovers that her father has a mistress, and her mother knows about it but prefers to remain silent. As Kira's family begins to fall apart —and so does the Soviet State— everything she knew turns out to be an illusion. Kira is searching for love, warmth, and hope for the future, going down a dark path she could not foresee.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/77lsmFGy2owudc1BZpabXJMNsIv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193820,"logo_path":"/ngxP3GmquT5NB6pwSQa0xKhxvng.png","name":"Family Production","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":33384,"logo_path":"/bLV4TDUm4H6UjFSr3d1oidO4rhy.png","name":"Common Ground Pictures","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i Väst","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do You Love Me?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
