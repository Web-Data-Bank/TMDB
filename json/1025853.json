But sometimes we wake up, and what we see, and what we hear above all, is part of another reality in which you are not alone when you understood that you were.  Are you afraid when you don't know if what you are experiencing can be or not? Are you afraid to believe in what is impossible?  Now something terrifying is happening. At times, you want to believe that it's a lie, that you're going to wake up... But no. This year, this is what happens...  Turn off the light, listen carefully and think... Will you let it devour your soul?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Akwr5BD3DMOZeGlU7uLWEdnBu2e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182533,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bezier Pixels","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lilith","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
