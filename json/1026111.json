The main character, whose grandfather was a master of washi (making Japanese traditional paper), gets acquainted with the culture and history of Echizen-washi and realizes her responsibility as a successor. Natsu Iwasaki was born in the city of Echizen and grew up familiar with washi as a descendant of washi artisans. When she was a child, she drew pictures on washi made by her grandfather, and received an award from the governor of the prefecture. However, I did not receive any prizes at the art university in the specialty “watercolor painting”, and now I am not sure of myself. Natsu and her family live in Tokyo, and her 80-year-old grandfather Junji still makes handmade Japanese paper in the city of Echizen alone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ahjVivQXHLqmkjgc50wWbQsJSkW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eternal of Link","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
