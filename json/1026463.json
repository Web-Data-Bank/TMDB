It is a story of wonder and intimacy, of vulnerability and fear and of not being able to let go even when you know it’s the right thing to do. A dual coming-of-age that centres Grace’s inability to leave the past behind or let herself become the woman she could be against Ama’s burgeoning puberty and curiosity of the world. As Grace is forced to confront the truth of her past, she has to come to terms with her trauma and its effects on Ama.","popularity":2.008,"poster_path":"/jHbjO4pmFFZPEnMHruw00fjVPoY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52352,"logo_path":"/dHjAAPaqpjsikkKzmhZ4ofQaEkQ.png","name":"Great Point Media","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":123168,"logo_path":"/6SHZV97AzWqcHwpVixJsQclYz8B.png","name":"Barry Crerar","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":110197,"logo_path":"/hAF2iSJDnOXG39VQQoMeF413SQf.png","name":"Screen Scotland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":288,"logo_path":"/aW0IpM9d4Zjj978EqgDVSxXXhTj.png","name":"BBC Film","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16877,"logo_path":"/pR2SnHFl7BvRIUuauFJrxXFYjeU.png","name":"BFI Film Fund","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The curious relationship between a girl and her mother is threatened by the hostile community around them.","title":"Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
