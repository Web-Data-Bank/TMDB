She is convinced that God will bless her business solely because she faithfully pays tithes and offerings to her church. Jessica, like other members of Abundant Life Cathedral, is experiencing hard times and have yet to receive the financial blessings so passionately promised by her pastor. After witnessing Jessica's dysfunction, delusion, and doctrinal detriment, successful businessman, Michael Juniors, offers to help.
