However, the film is entirely generated by three different artificial intelligences, in fact, the humans creating the sounds and images are simply the vessel of the marvelous machines. As a matter of fact, we have observed their behaviors, their ways of looking at and creating the world, and their films. Now that we have been fed enough, we have copied and ultimately improved the original film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kfEIuJaUjE7qnHkzyNFJNBrTJ2y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Généré Jetée","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
