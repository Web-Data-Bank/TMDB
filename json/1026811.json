The story of an outcast child in a city infested with crime lurking every reeking corner who learns the significance of doing the right thing. The world of Batmania is an amplified version of the real world, making it a nightmarish hellhole in which even the purest of good hearts find no solace and lose hope. The main character, Philos Redd (played by Mazu Sircle) is someone whose ideals and values are completely against the grain of everyone around him, leaving him tortured and alone, struggling to find purpose in a world that seems like it wants nothing to do with him; that disregards his identity, his morality and who he is and wants to be.\r Watch here: https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx2VsCDz0tPh-ADOpUhDSEexeetmcGNSSx","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":182715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banana Bullet Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Doing the right thing can hurt...
