Set against the stunning backdrop of Montreal in Quebec, the four unconnected stories make great use of locations and 'real' looking performers. The undisputed star of the movie is hugely-endowed actor Rod Majors, (in one of his earliest roles) as a sexy streetwise hustler. In the opening story Rod and his partner in crime, Claude Jourdan, break into a luxury penthouse and go hard at it. When the owner (Luc Cote) arrives home the look of horror on his face is is hysterical! But before long Cote soon joins in. A fabulous looking-movie, beautifully photographed and very sexy. The ridiculous French language dubbing proves to be the only distraction, otherwise the film is superb!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ylz65LZjQR03kY2eq0TMA54AsJG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kristen Bjorn Video","origin_country":"US"},{"id":97711,"logo_path":"/jQJ4THh84Ski3S9ijyMKDHRZXHM.png","name":"Sarava Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1993-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montreal Men","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
