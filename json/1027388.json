This is a kind of game that Japanese boys play, hiding one arm under their shirts and moving it back and forth. It is usually just a simple trick used to surprise someone, but Takata wanted to convert this silly boy’s prank into a more romantic gesture where the high school boy is flirting with another boy sitting next to him, using the tentacle-like appendage protruding from his chest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jxObaR07m1uTO7qGu3vLgNwE2GS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Phantom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
