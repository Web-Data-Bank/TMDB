These men, now in their 60s, reflect on what has happened to their generation, why most of their friends and relatives died so young and how this particular apartment block captures the story of a whole generation. The voices and lives of the departed are included in clips from amateur videos from the 1990s. Set against the background of old friends’ attempt to understand their deaths, this film is about nostalgia and how memories kindle a special kind of love for home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l3yKh3Q8unDheTnrvNqgsJH275s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2022-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"12/35","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
