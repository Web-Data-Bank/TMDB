It is of course a parody of the novel by Alexandre Dumas fils, La dame aux camélias . As the press noted in 1942: “…the work is a real revenge of Quebec popular culture on French classical culture” or even “ Fridolin sticks his tongue out at France!”.  The film is like a bomb. We must not forget that at the time of the premiere, Gratien Gélinas was one of the most influential authors in the province. His plays were performed in French in Quebec, and in English across Canada.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1942-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Dame aux Camélias, la vraie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
