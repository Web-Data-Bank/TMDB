To do this, Gustav must re-enact memories from his life, that each elicit one of six pure human emotions: pleasantness, unpleasantness, arousal, subduing, stress and relaxation. Only after performing these memories to a mysterious god, known as the Monad, will he find out if he's reached his goal. But first he must practise; Alma hires an acting coach to help him do just that.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4sMvYJ35jX5Rs3eOEQk7FzPxnLG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Application Process","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
