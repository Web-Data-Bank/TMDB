Their mission is to bring back something of value but what they find instead is an inert, probably dead, man inside. Lee and Sonny are forced to confront their naive notions of masculinity and codes of honour when the dead man turns out to be a wanted criminal in hiding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Honour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
