The narrative conveys that didko is waiting for everyone who misbehaves and will torture them. Only this work doesn't depict them in a traditional way, with little horns upon the pig's face, with goat legs and covered in fur. Instead, it suggests their appearance as humans, implying that anyone could be a sinner and anyone could be a devil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/su7YBTSmzeoqXgZBANEp3SWdi49.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weird","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
