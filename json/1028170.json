Specifically, keirin track bicycle racing. An aging cyclist is too young to quit racing, but too old to keep up. A friendship between two old friends would fall apart, if it wasn’t for the keirin race. In between, a magical realist fable about the bond between a woman and her bike.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qsoP0tswOmaqQ7AuIzKKS0KuaIX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11629,"logo_path":"/bwYUtLEtn2A9lQ3D0Sz7FOftm3C.png","name":"Yoshimoto Kogyo","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tamano Visual Poetry Collection: Nagisa‘s Bicycle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
