Vijay and Kalpana both study in the same college. Vijay wants to groom Kalpana to be the new president of the student body, to which Kalpana agrees. Kalpana is very popular in the college, and seems that the majority of votes will go in her favor. This does not auger well with the rival student body, which is headed by the son of Thakur (Sadashiv Amrapurkar). Kalpana is pressured to resign as head of her student union, to which she refuses. Even Vijay attempts to persuade Kalpana to step aside are in vain. Politics heats up to such an extent, so as to threaten the entire community, the police are indecisive and reluctant to act, and no one seems safe anymore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tflUCK42GyYyDw2hb10S1SxRwSz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaafila","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
