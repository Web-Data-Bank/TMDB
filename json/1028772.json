Mr. Ebitsuka was a teacher at Tama Art University, and he happened to be appointed concurrently to the second department of art, where I work, and we became close. He was born in 1951, so he is 16 years younger than me. I wanted to think about and experience the \"contemporary art\" that I hadn't been to. And he, being selfish, visited his atelier and was shown around his works on an island in the Seto Inland Sea. For me, the year 2000 was a year of Ebitsuka-san's sculptures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2DfrEaPQBb3IixSLcEh3yp5cddF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EBIZUKA in my own field","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
