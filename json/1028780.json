Both venues could be said to be fundamentally community-oriented spaces, which seek to offer comfort and welfare for either the visitor’s mind or body. In the film, the continuous change of scenes between the two kind of spaces with the dancer’s bodily presence, their movements, and dialogues, aims at achieving a sort of almost impossible mergence or coexistence of religious practice on one side and club culture on the other side. In this 18 minutes video, we follow the protagonists’ struggles, passion, and commitment in trying to adjust their choreographies to fit into the new contexts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7nxRq4OD5qiA3OmsCyufhDaktov.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wish You a Lovely Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
