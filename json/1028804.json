Okay, not really, but everyone knows one, works with one or has a sister that’s dating one of us. What makes you African? Is it enough that you’re born there? Do you need to be able to dance? Why does being South African not register as African in most places? You’re thinking about it right now aren’t you? Questioning it. Africa changes people. People who visit game reserves wear ranger outfits... why is that? We don’t wear scrubs when going to the doctor... Africa puts things in perspective, this show will help you find that focus, delivered to you by a Token African.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bUm2gZra9ZpR3LKtD7yz57k7IuD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urzila Carlson: Token African","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
