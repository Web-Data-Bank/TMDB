Filmmaker Marina Zenovich took her cameras to host country Estonia - the winner in 2001 - to document preparations for the 2002 contest, and found a hotbed of jealous rivalries, national outrage and soap-opera-style scandals. Why did winning duo Tanel and Dave break up just weeks after their win? Why is handsome actor Mart Sander passed over for the presenter job? How does Tanel's sister react when she fails to make the cut for the 2002 contest? Through interviews and observation, Zenovich creates what the London Guardian described as \"A Star is Born with extra snow.\"","popularity":1.371,"poster_path":"/617QsBCT1Ze291yAZy784kPk642.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61605,"logo_path":null,"name":"VIXPIX Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Estonia Dreams of Eurovision!","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
