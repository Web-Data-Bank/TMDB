But when handsome network executive Christopher shows up threatening to halt production on her latest movie, Jessica’s assistant, Reena, points out the irony: Jessica isn’t just trying to save her Christmas movie, she’s actually living in one. Jessica must now juggle all the classic tropes—her actors falling in and out of love, a wayward elf dog, and her own stirring romantic feelings for her perceived nemesis—in order to get her movie and her life to their happy endings.","popularity":8.445,"poster_path":"/f8D6dobydMiuabqRDQi0598ghc4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79279,"logo_path":"/gcCJ3eCR1bzw7IPQX3UoxqClpUP.png","name":"ESX Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":186218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lila Lane Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She's directed every love story... but her own.","title":"A Hollywood Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":5.936,"vote_count":39}
