Perching upon his ear, these magical creatures recount fantastic and peculiar folk tales into the teenagerâ€™s mind, as if speaking directly into his dreams. Relating an erotic fable of an Arabian princess who escapes her palace to spend lurid evenings with common men, the birds entice the young man toward his own desire. Their elaborate narrative, which unfolds with ambiguous shifts in genders and protagonists, escalates in intensity until it is suddenly interrupted, just before it reaches the best part of the story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zmiaIovQdNTeGFbvfhOecRCWZVq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Princess and the Magic Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
