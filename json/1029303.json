It was the days of the Fraser River Gold Rush, which saw some 30 to 40 thousand gold seekers flood into the Fraser Valley, culminating in the Fraser River War in August of that year. Many lives were lost, both Native and non-Native, until peace was finally concluded in Lytton through diplomatic efforts of N'lakapamux Chief, Spintlum, and an American miner and militia Captain Henry Snyder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jk1VRVKSR7xn0GWMAppKkM9FI4l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canyon War: The Untold Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
