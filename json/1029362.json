He’s been produced by XTC’s Andy Partridge, and written for the likes of Captain Sensible of The Damned. Though it would be wrong to call him an \"unknown\", he has never been directly in the limelight. This film brings to light the amazing career and life work of the artist, who, on top of being the most published contemporary British poet as well as an established gardener, continues to record and release music today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xPdU8xkqhHtorPPWdxD16h8Lowc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187752,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sharp Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Martin Newell is The Jangling Man","title":"The Jangling Man: The Martin Newell Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
