It alights and blankets the landscape, transforming it into a mythological scenery. Everything sounds differently: steps, children's jolly laughter, bells chiming in a distance, the public announcer at a ski race, even silence. Snow scrunches under the feet, and, after all, one moves differently: on skis, on a snowboard, on snowshoes, or on a sleigh, in a cable car, or, slower than normally, in a car on a slippery road. Being indispensible for the tourist industry, snow produces a linguistic paradoxon: snow guns to secure snow. Snow/Schnee explores the Semmering region in Lower Austria in 23 deep winter motifs: a film to listen to, a soundscape to see.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SNOW | SCHNEE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
