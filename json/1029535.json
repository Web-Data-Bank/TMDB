The Levys of Monticello is a documentary film that tells the little-known story of the Levy family, which owned and carefully preserved Monticello for nearly a century â€“ far longer than Jefferson or his descendants. The remarkable story of the Levy family also intersects with the rise of antisemitism that runs throughout the course of American history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ge8JYZ74SaCUzibGu78yH0ggIyI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Levys of Monticello","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
