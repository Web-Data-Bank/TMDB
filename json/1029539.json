In previous years, we’ve focused our knee-slapping man-reaping sights on everything from vehicular mayhem to gut-busting infanticide. We brought you Vehikills and decapitations during the pandemic years; You sick and depraved fools still couldn’t get enough! We were banging our heads against the warm walls of the Alamo and it must have been the perfect mix of patriotism and stupidity that opened the floodgates to creative genius. For this, my hungry hippos, we said to ourselves, We must bring in Louise Weard, Filmmaker, writer, programmer, and even a Canadian, to join our very own Zack Carlson to help make this the greatest kills of all time. We proudly raise the flag, salute your shorts, and present 100 BEST KILLS : Texas Birth Control, Dick Destruction... A celebration and reliably comforting countdown of castrations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vhdLTudFLradkuTqSfu5BSqM0uu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fantastic Fest’s life-defying show returns from the grave with a dazzling onslaught-er of the finest chills, shrills, and kills in a presentation you never wanted to see, but won’t be able to look away from!","title":"100 Best Kills: Texas Birth Control, Dick Destruction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
