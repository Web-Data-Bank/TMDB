Most of it was composed and recorded in the Ebro Delta (a nature reserve that’s one of the most climate change threatened environments in the Iberian Peninsula) in September 2019. Since then it’s been performed live in different venues and it has evolved to become an hour-long audiovisual piece and an album. Source material includes modular synth compositions, field recordings, and video footage captured throughout the Eufònic/LoPati residency, field recordings from a canal boat in London, and underwater footage from the Mediterranean Sea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wetland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
