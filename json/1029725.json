Captured through the stories of locals, this visual poem shows the modern side of a centuries-old culture preserved through generational traditions.  Originally from New Zealand and now residing in Los Angeles, the director spent the past year and a half with his friend, photographer Ben Kilpatrick, documenting ranches along the rivers of the sprawling city. “We both got fascinated by the area,” says Myers. “One day, we approached a few men riding along the fence line outside their stable and asked if we could take some pictures. That’s how it all started.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q7D5wKUT7cNLKonbvOBGFdMUi9O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Take a ride through California’s history to meet the original cowboys of the West Coast","title":"Vaquero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
