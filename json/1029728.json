The mission is simple: aliens must capture and record living specimens from earth. However a violent earthquake forces the ship to take off whilst a giant robot, used to collect specimens, is swallowed up in the eruption. During quarry excavations in the present day the robot is re-animated, and the mission is still on.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y3pnRJ2FZ0yOfWQhp29JMaevch0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gothic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Specimens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
