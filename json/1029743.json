After the reform and opening up, with the change of policies, a large number of workers in this old factory were laid off and forced to stay idle. Just as China's modern art residence sprouted, 798 ArtDist came into being。Now it has been from a factory number to an art district, which displayed a process of conceptual transformation of the art industry.
