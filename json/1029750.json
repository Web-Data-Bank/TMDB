One day, her estranged older brother shows up, bringing back the pain and grief she suffered when she was disowned by their parents seven years ago. Her brother informs her of their mother’s recent death and sees the loneliness behind her glamorous facade. Touched, she decides to visit her hometown, only to hear that her parents had lied to everyone that she had died years ago to conceal her transgender identity. She turns around and leaves resolutely, with her only hope of reconciliation with her family being through the fantasies she performs onstage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eKLc2sCGVBGqDL2NEW2aPateS7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TRUTHLESS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
