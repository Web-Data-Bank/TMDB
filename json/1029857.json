These are all sides of the same medal. Why do we love others if love can hurt us so much? Wouldn’t it be safer not to love? In this documentary, several people who have been profoundly confronted with love and death in their lives, provide glimpses of the enigma of love, based on their personal stories. On Freud’s famous couch, they are questioned about their experiences. Their stories are interwoven with timeless works from the history of painting and music. When words are not adequate, there is art and music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fosEO3I39jsPyaA6Og1HOaOPnZX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'amour La mort","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
