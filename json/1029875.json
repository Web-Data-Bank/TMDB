In this case he brings an improvised homage to the great silent slapstick tradition. In the idiom of the silent film, but with the absurdist humour of Dada, he presents two brothers who wear the traditional Filipino barong.

The necessary colourful slapstick extras cross their path as well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmless Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barong Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
