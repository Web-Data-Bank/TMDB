Lohengrin's cousin, worried about the stability of his marriage, convinces some relatives who live in the countryside to welcome the dreaded guest into their home and then, to avoid meeting him, leaves. Meanwhile, in the country house everyone eagerly awaits Lohengrin, and envy and spite are unleashed during the wait. In particular, while the young landlady prepares the house, the woman's husband begins to be tormented by jealousy.
