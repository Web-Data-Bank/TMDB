He creates for the love of it with no obvious goal. He sees the world very differently from everyone else. He tends to favor magic over fact. He has a unique spin on everything. Even the most mundane conversations can quickly slip into time travel or how his dog, Teddy, has a magical aura. Aside from all of his wonderful creations, the most overwhelming characteristic about him is his heart of gold. He is a polite, timid soul that would never say a bad word against anyone.  He is a shy character so after he agreed to make the film we were unsure how he was going to react. But he opened up a lot more than what we expected. We recorded endless conversations. He offered up photos from his past and was happy to reshoot the final shot on three separate occasions until we got it right.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yDe1FIkOSIZW4JanspHx8ZJXvFC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Step into the interplanetary imaginarium of a man who spent 16 years living in a bus","title":"Jon The Bus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
