Coming from a working-class home in the East End and also training with the English National Ballet, Jones went on to become a documentary photographer for The Observer, alongside Magnum greats like Don McCullen and Ian Berry. During his career he also shot iconic portraits of British rock band The Who and musicians Mick Jagger and Pete Townsend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/grkTVACl5JX9FLWIjEa0iLIkze9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A look at the ballet dancer-turned-photographer who became one of the most significant voices of post-war Britain","title":"Colin Jones: The End of Photography","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
