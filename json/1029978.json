The wisened Calabrian invites the viewer into his sun-washed world of bright orange sun umbrellas, cool blue seas, freshly baked pastries and fresh vegetables.  Directed by Jan Vrhovnik, written by Ana Kerin and music score by Oscar-winning Nico Casal, Paradiso is less story and more a poetic thought piece. Dipping into a snapshot of life for an aging man from Italy, whimsical moments like the swatting of a fly are interspersed with provocative thoughts on life that can only come with the wisdom of an older man who has seen it all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/89rH21xlg35jQVLxjmXMUKERVFS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Discover the secret to living the good life in this sun-kissed silhouette of the Calabrian coast","title":"Paradiso","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
