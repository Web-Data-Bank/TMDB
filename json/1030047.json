She locks herself in her apartment, determined to rehearse until she achieves perfection. Her compulsion makes her enter a state of growing delirium, to the point of not sleeping and hardly eating. Her rehearsals are only interrupted when she notices a dirt stain on the carpet. Silvia tries to clean it in vain.
