Most of their ancestors were forced to flee during the Japanese occupation / annexation (1910-1945). The name they gave themselves is Koryo-saram. Their language, Koryo-mar, is descended from the Hamgy√∂ng dialect (province of North Korea) and many other variants of Northeast Korean. The documentary sets up a multi-voice narrative characterized by shamanic rituals, digital glitches, voiceovers, texts and sound panoramas. At the same time inter-subjective and deeply personal, the film recounts migration, the diaspora and death with humor and lightness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bRgUFqQrxV2nzr0vhHpjS1IQN0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K-Saram: Tale of the Pig Head","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
