The elderly lady's increasing forgetfulness prompts her son to suggest that she move into a nursing home. But then suddenly a crack opens up in one of the walls of her apartment, through which something enters Mrs. Pospisil's world that will change her life forever. Paul Ertl's highly efficient and picture-perfect The Crack is a psychologically underpinned mid-length horror miniature that transforms into a utopia as casual as it is original as it is gently disturbing, and is ultimately also a powerful plea for the autonomy of older people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xB6FrphRICBWReLEoJtM5q1j72E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rupture","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
