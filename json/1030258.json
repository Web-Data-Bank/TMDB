The three beginner (lunar) and four intermediate (solar) sequences in this program allow you to evolve your practice as well as to tailor your workout to your mood, energy level, and schedule.  Doing yoga daily - even for 20 minutes - can help you achieve power and serenity, strength and composure.  These practices are designed to fit seamlessly with the ebb and flow of your life: try a calming lunar segment on a hectic day, or opt for a stimulating solar workout when you need energy.  No matter what you choose, you'll be sculpting long, lean muscles as you revitalize your spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xE0KixXGYZ4svzsvb9CFEOcSrwa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":158,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shiva Rea: More Daily Energy - Vinyasa Flow Yoga","video":true,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1}
