The girls have got married and have left for the villages. Boys are getting married in villages. It should be taught to children”.  — Gyani Maiya Sen-Kusunda  The Gi Mihaq (also known as Kusunda) was a semi-nomadic hunter and gatherer community that settled in villages around the mid-western Nepalese district of Dang. They have long lost their native language Mihaq (Kusunda), to acculturation and other barriers to active use. The community also lost their 83-year-old elder Gyani Maiya Sen-Kusunda in 2020, the most and the only known fluent Kusunda speaker then. Filmed in Kulmor in the Dang District in 2018, this openly-licensed documentary is a memoir of Sen-Kusunda in her own words and a biography of her people who were forced to leave their language and cultural identity. Kusunda is being revived by Kamala Sen Khatri, Sen-Kusunda’s younger sister, and Uday Raj Aaley, a local researcher who is the key interviewer for this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yzCXxLcBRptMTpsF7wZu7HXvpI4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183314,"logo_path":null,"name":"O Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"2019-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No community can express the pain of losing an elder, especially when one was presumed to be the last fluent speaker of their language and the language is nearing endangerment.","title":"Gyani Maiya","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
