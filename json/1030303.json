Overlooked and betrayed, Banquo had a rough go of it in Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Now, reexamine the “Scottish Play” through the eyes of the title character’s murdered best friend. Banquo considers how he might have responded to the prophesies of the Weird Sisters had he been in Macbeth’s position—questioning his own motives, desires, and temptations. Tim Crouch’s I, Banquo is staged by Marti Lyons, one of the most sought-after directors in American theater with extensive credits at DC’s Studio Theater, Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, Writers Theatre, and American Players Theatre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cWLJp43uTDSgyStDBVsn2f6ISVj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chicago Shakespeare Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I, Banquo","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
