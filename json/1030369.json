Black Daddy: The Movie is a passion project covering a space that is near to our hearts; black fatherhood. I followed the lives of a few like-minded men as they told compelling stories of the joy, pain and the complexity of what it means to be a black father in America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Daddy: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
