As Aaron rose up the Boy Scout ranks, he slowly became aware of Sheehan’s grooming techniques and began to realize he had much more sinister intentions in store for him.  If Aaron’s parents had known that since the 1920s the Boy Scouts of America had been keeping hidden files on dangerous pedophiles in their ranks while failing to warn the public, the police, the scouts, their parents, or even fully removing them from the Boy Scouts program, they would have never allowed young Aaron to be part of such a complicit and corrupt organization.","popularity":1.403,"poster_path":"/zx7qpWxJ2PsJ8RzyVW5IU2scNqQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186297,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.
