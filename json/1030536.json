In short, scars have become a proof, a proof of existence, a proof of alive, a proof of pain, and a proof of a certain age. Beginning in 1949, in this vast land, these various scars, these healing marks, patterns, sad shapes, bring personal memories, collective pains, the marks of history, and come together Gaze, the meaning of the record.
