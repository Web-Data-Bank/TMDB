It consists of three parts exploring a journey through pain to a healing space of self-worth. In the video Prokne is inhabiting three realms of reality and is contemplating on the questions: how can we deal with being socially marginalized? how can we build something new? how can we imagine new possibilities of being and feeling?  Itys, Praxithea and Me is a dreamy queer performance, a poetic narrative deeply rooted in the body as it interacts with the landscape. Nature and demolished buildings are the stage for the performances with words being constantly present and absent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wLWMOzipA9GLAAtNXJm4T0V04h3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Itys, Praxithea and Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
