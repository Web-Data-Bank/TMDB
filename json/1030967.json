In 2020 Eleanor climbed a hill, and that was the only thing she did all year. Sharp, silly stand-up infused with occasional characters and sketch about what it means to fail and keep trying. And climbing hills.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/omtlEsEPZ2NHgdy7PUL0J5dWdMa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Up Comedy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eleanor Morton Has Peaked","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
