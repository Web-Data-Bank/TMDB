This movie is called: Across the Universe. In this film, each street and square was filmed in a single sequence shot and each of the plaques for these streets and squares is placed at the beginning of each street and square.  In order to offer a maximum of views of the city, here is Les Chutes de Saint-Marcellin, an appendix to Across the Universe which is made up of shots that were not retained for this film but which deserve to be kept and shown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zdmYVZi5EP21q4sbdZAKFAsLhZs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Chutes de Saint-Marcellin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
