Mahoney and jonCates direct Silverror’s Saloon, the next film in the 鬼鎮 (Ghosttown) Glitch Western series of films and games. Written by Emily Mercedes Rich and jonCates, this experimental film queers, glitches, and questions the Western film genre. We encounter characters caught in a glitched cinematic magic moment: a love scene. First dance with a stranger. Home and far from home. Flicker, flower, bloom, and dissolve, in a poetry film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yREau5TGev01SO38JRrjOm60fOB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silverror's Saloon, a 鬼鎮 (Ghosttown) Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
