A story of maturation and care. A story of a family that learns to break up and separate without hurting each other and without causing trauma. A family that learns to understand the thoughts and attitudes of others as everything gets more and more tense outside their home. A family that does everything possible to talk and understand each other, because, deep down, they love and respect each other. A family that will find a way to forgive and heal the wounds produced throughout this process.","popularity":0.671,"poster_path":"/6AC0ChQZWscv0U4fnSR7xFYgtwi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5085,"logo_path":"/mPuVc7m1Ki7OQQvAYwYfIlEI3vu.png","name":"TV3","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Catal√†"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alguns dies d'ahir","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
