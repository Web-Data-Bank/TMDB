Then this is probably the first thing you heard: \"wa make?\" The most frequently asked question among friends and neighbours. With friends it rather means: how are you? What are you doing; or just, do you actually already have a job? But both Georgette and Meryem are now asking each other: wa make? Do we always say how we are really doing? In this comedy show, Erhan finds out how we interact with each other.
