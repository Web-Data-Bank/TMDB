The Kurds are the largest ethnic group without one; Kurdish-inhabited areas reach into Iran, Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. The documentary takes us to the battle lines between Kurdish forces and the Islamic State in Kirkuk and the Sinjar Mountains (Iraq), and Kobani (Syria). In December 2014 and January 2015, Erik Valenčič made it to the front lines of the fierce offensives and interviewed key figures in the struggle for an independent Kurdistan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mAFeC004Xl0jrk6l9euCqBVqqIP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Front Lines of Kurdistan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
