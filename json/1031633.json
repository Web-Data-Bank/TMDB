The story revolves around folklore and folk songs narrated by Nani Ma. Born in the 1920s in pre-independent rural India in a coastal village in the Balasore district of Odisha, she never got to go beyond the first few days of school.  The film is an alternate history of a society broken through colonization, Brahminical patriarchy and a post-famine (Orissa famine of 1866, killing nearly 5 million people, one-third of the population), and the dominance of formal writing over spoken tongues. Three academics -- Damayanti Beshra, PhD (recipient of India’s fourth civilian award, “Padma Shri”), Panchanan Mohanty, PhD (noted linguist), and Laxmikanta Tripathy, PhD, DLitt (anthropologist and author) -- also appear in the film to provide contextual commentary on patriarchy, oral history and the sociolinguistic diversity.","popularity":0.702,"poster_path":"/z0kbaVY26ubVdOobr0c3TrTZIok.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183314,"logo_path":null,"name":"O Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2022-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Oriya","iso_639_1":"or","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Musamoni never received schooling, and her early marriage brought her an early widowhood.
