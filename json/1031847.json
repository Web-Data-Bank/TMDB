Abbey Road Studio 2 will subsequently see an explosion of creativity and innovation in song writing and recording techniques the likes of which has never been seen. It will herald one of the most productive periods ever in the history of pop music. Revolver, Sgt. Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album, Let it Be and Abbey Road: these six iconic albums were recorded in the short space of five memorable years. But...they were never performed live. Until now! The Analogues perform all six of these albums in their entirety, precisely as the records were made at the time, using the same vintage instruments, amplifiers, sounds, live strings and horns. This is The Analogues performing the amazing Magical Mystery Tour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gJ2cjiuVIG8KdAxzJzF5EMqSzV7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Over Easy B.V. - Amsterdam","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Analogues Perform The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour","title":"The Analogues Perform The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
