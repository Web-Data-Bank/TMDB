If we wish to heal society, we need to heal ourselves. Our society, and consequently us as individuals, operates on a worldview based in separation, in seeing and feeling ourselves to be separate from nature. Separation is an illusion. In reality, we are far more connected than we could possibly imagine. This film explores the topic of our unity and shows how spiritual traditions around the world have understood this for millennia, and how modern science is beginning to understand it now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dm6wjKQdTxAD4OuEZjPaTF9eF9B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Is Self","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
