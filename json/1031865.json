For him, Erich Honecker is an example for \"forced stoicism\". Müller agrees with the following quote by Goethe: May God save me from self-awareness! For Müller, it represents a stoic attitude. When asked about \"patriotism\" in the sense of \"What would you risk your life for, if necessary?\", he can only come up with something \"silly\" at first: his daughter. But Müller is also a patriot of theater, in the sense of \"maeeuticism\", of putting-effort-into-it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rigor Was His Mark of Quality","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
