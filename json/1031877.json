The Adagietto is a revelation, a spiritual oasis. It is not an expression of pain, but rather Mahler's declaration of love to Alma a song without words.\" With the Gewandhaus Orchestra, Chailly gives the piece an unsurpassed intensity of sound and emotional expression. He achieves a compelling arc of tension in which the symphony's unique fascination unfolds. The Wiener Zeitung characterized Chailly's interpretation as \"impressive with powerful and unreserved intensity.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vLOilRyYrq3A8xOTePbSD7bsxRu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gustav Mahler - Symphony No. 5 (Gewandhaus Orchestra Leipzig, Riccardo Chailly)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
