This is established through the identification of chronological events that are similar to the story of Shakuntala authored by Kalidasa. Adaptations have been made to the Indian story, transforming it to the Malay version and prominent differences are notable. The principal story of Dewi Murni remains the same whereby the main characters meet in unlikely surroundings, woo and get married. Both King Dushyanta [in Shakuntala] and King Indraloka [in Dewi Murni] lose memory of their wives (in different ways), the heroines lose their signet rings and are rejected by their respective husbands at the palace court.  In both stories, the rings are discovered in a fish’s maw and upon its re-emergence, the kings’ memories of their respective wives are regained. In the end after a period of separation, the lovers are reunited. - Sumathi Maniam Raj & Raja Morgan Veerappan","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vEgI2ECcJwvX4NjNz5FOCcwa2lt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malay Film Productions Ltd.","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1950-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dewi Murni","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
