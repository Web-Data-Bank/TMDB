Like many young girls, Frances dreamed of being a movie star - a dream that came true when Rolf de Heer cast her in the lead female role of Nowalingu in Ten Canoes. Her journey from traditional tribal life to red carpets and awards ceremonies is unlike any other. It's a fascinating and unique story as Frances learns to overcome huge personal and cultural challenges. River of No Return is a story of change and transformation as Frances learns to move between the ancient life of the Yolgnu and modern world of the balanda (white culture).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3HX1ixDSjPe9mf3PvYiJiR7IT6u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of Frances Daingangan, one of the stars of 'Ten Canoes' and her journey from traditional tribal life to the international red carpet.","title":"River of No Return","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
