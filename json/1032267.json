With the help of her mischievous alter ego, she searches for the animal within. Over three years in the making, its mutable clay characters negotiate an eerie Australasian landscape (created with multi-plane paint-on-glass sets), inhabited only by strange birds and roving creatures of the night. Feline investigates the possibilities for changing oneself in a world where physicality and identity are fluid. It is a tale of denial, sexual awakening, and self acceptance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
