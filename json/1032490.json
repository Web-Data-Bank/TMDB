Amanda has suffered from two heart attacks already, and Edward believes the third time will be a charm. To help induce another attack, Edward hires an ex-con nurse, Esther to \"scare her to death\". However, Esther becomes less than enthusiastic about killing Amanda, but becomes increasingly more curious about the secrets held in the house, including a mysterious third sister, Meredith. An eerie secluded mansion, a tormented recluse, strange psychosexual perversions, a macabre family and a ghastly secret locked away in the attic combine to tell a chilling tale of greed, deceit and murder!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Go6nSl8S7Z2UAU6MKwyEvaD3sG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83309,"logo_path":null,"name":"42ND street films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Screaming Won't Help You, Amanda!","title":"Die Sister, Die!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
