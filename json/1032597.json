The viewer gets to know her in the last weeks before her release from the general regime colony, where she gave birth to a daughter at the age of 18. The way of life, customs, customs of the women's zone, in which the painfully familiar features of our \"free\" life manifest themselves, where Olya is so eager, make up the background of the heroine's portrait. The warm, kind intonation of the film awakens what we all lack so much – sympathy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Olya in Captivity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
