Why is his work at the factory a great joy rather than a boring obligation? Why does he turn on the lights after sunset? He has been through a lot. Bullied and beaten in his childhood, Sasha was often very ill. Why does he never complain? It's a miracle he can hear at all. So he listens to the world around him, to what his fellow passengers on the bus talk about. Through these conversations about minor or important, private or global, fleeting and eternal things alike, Sasha gets to know people, as well as himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":117526,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belsat TV","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short documentary about a blind man living in Belarus.","title":"In the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
