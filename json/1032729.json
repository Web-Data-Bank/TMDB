As a joke between friends, he ends up getting stuck between two concrete columns placed in front of his bar. However, the joint is so perfect that no one is able to free it anymore. The mayor arrives with the brigade, then the ASL nurses, the firefighters, but there is nothing to be done: Ciccio gets stuck and demolition projects are even made that arouse the terror of the tenants of the building. The only possible evolution of the story is that Ciccio, now known by all as \"Cicciocolonna\", gets stuck between the columns and becomes \"a coincidence\". In fact, the TV that spreads the news arrives: Cicciocolonna becomes a point of reference for the whole country. A kind of living monument, but also a sort of essay to which people go to ask for advice and even the numbers to play the lottery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2xDVdc7kwJ9QkW8LK0V1UHG0kRP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruvido Produzioni","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":183751,"logo_path":null,"name":"Max Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ciccio Colonna","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
