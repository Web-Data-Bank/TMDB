Her beaten face is discolored, one eye is swollen, and she is bleeding from the edge of her mouth. The headlights of a car approaching from behind frightens Maika, and she loses her balance and falls. Just as she is about to get up, her cell phone rings. It's a call from Masayoshi, her abusive husband. Out of fear, Maika knocks the phone to the ground and breaks it. Slowly, she picks herself up and continues walking down the street at night. She arrives at a love hotel hidden in the suburbs of a provincial city.","popularity":0.63,"poster_path":"/7BxuKmSh5iS4dUNzey8ZpOkFeOf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164697,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rights Cube","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Break in the Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
