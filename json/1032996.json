Shot on an ever present handheld camera, the reality of the (non)passing time of the pandemic slowly reveals itself. As the protagonists mutually confess and unmask each other over past unfulfilled relationships, we witness how they naturally complement one another in the household. The look inward, at ordinary events, gradually transforms the apartment into an autonomous world of imagination and song. The film thus serves as a manifesto of creation as an escape from an otherwise closed-up world. With giddy exaggeration, the emerging friendship opens up more general questions of the human need for social interaction and sharing life.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":"/cynFQCJ3ippo06cX1i7jwXz8AxJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92467,"logo_path":"/2036VCDrFeZtxm7cm3xLHZNST22.png","name":"Film Kolektiv","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
