Twenty years later, her search for a specialized medical treatment leads her to the door of someone who was once exceptionally close to Josh. And so it is that she finally has the chance to truly know her brother through his chosen family. Captured over five years in which synchronicities continually manifested, Platzerâ€™s documentation of these encounters gently asserts that both grieving and healing are meant to be communal experiences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/afqaJbaymrDWr3QxqlDXL67pb2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Back Home Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"back home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
