After her death in 1996, her music was only widely picked up and sold. The American was at home in all markets, as can be seen on this DVD; she plays jazz, pop, country and folk together. Covers like What A Wonderful World, Time After Time and Autumn Leaves are beautifully performed in a unique way. The performance was filmed somewhat amateurishly with one camera, 9 months before her death on January 2 and 3, 1996, at the Blues Alley Jazz Club in Washington. The sound is perfect and Cassidy sings flawlessly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eUB5UWZN9bmMnA3WqsyFEjTqk5P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eva Cassidy - Sings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
