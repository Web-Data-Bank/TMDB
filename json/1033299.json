The largest of them is Bering Island. A small settlement, Nikolskoye, is perched on its edge.  Protagonist Arkasha [hypocoristic for Arkadiy] is 17. He’s been living his whole life on the island but this summer he graduates from school and prepares to leave home. He likes making cakes, which is why he decided to pursue further education as a food technologist in Smolensk.  With only a few days left until Arkasha takes off, his best friend breaks both arms quite badly, while the Island becomes overcast with thunder clouds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Into the Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
