Mike Haggar, former champion wrestler, street fighter, and newly elected Mayor of Metro City, ushers in a strong political stance against the Mad Gear gang. Going public, Haggar quickly realizes the threat is far more ingrained than he could have ever imagined. On the street level is Cody Travers, a young man tired of living his life in fear who has reached a point of no return. Cody's answer is to fight fire with fire and bring fear and violence back to the Mad Gear gang. Will their tactics to save their city root out the gang problem ? Or is it just a catalyst that will envelope the city into chaos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nxLSUynKWvXuJ8AisZWi5ojCKn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183852,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epic Rival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Broken Gear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
