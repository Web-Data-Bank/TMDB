It is then the search for different landscape signs, natural signs, human signs or the same unusual signs, which allow us to know in depth the country we discover, and thus to better love and understand it. Castles having passed through the centuries with more or less happiness, Romanesque art, frescoes, churches, thermal baths from which mysterious patients arise, figures petrified under the moon, and Vichy, the most exotic of the cities, constitute some-one of the stages of this journey where the strange is born from the simple vision of beings and things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dIlSPsCjj6Q8u5fQYW2Tt6UBNHP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volcans endormis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
