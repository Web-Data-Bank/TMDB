It is not part of the anthology and is therefore out of collection. However, he has all the characteristics of an official Cinématon but the filmmaker, who had just lent himself to the cinematon game a year earlier, on the occasion of the 2000th portrait of his collection, did not want to overload his fetish series with new portraits of him. He preferred not to integrate it while ensuring that this portrait has a real existence, that it is visible and that it is a film in its own right.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5QyiUcapLyOJ9SB9l4VV7RThmSo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encore Cinématé !","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
