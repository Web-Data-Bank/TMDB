The characters belonging to the world of fiction become credible reality for the spectator thanks to the actor's technique. In Traces in the Snow the technique itself becomes the protagonist. The actor carries on a dialogue with the secrets, which precede and follow the building of a character and the creation of a performance –  and its process, she exposes these secrets.
