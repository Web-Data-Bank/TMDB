There's also wall-to-wall absurdity, a cross between Ricky Gervais, Monty Python and Sam Raimi. On the lineup are three short films (MOJA, VISITORS and COEXISTENCE) and one surprise: TWIST (the tantalizing teaser for a film to be released in 2023). Gore that makes you laugh and laughs that make you think in one bizarre package, guaranteed to send you on a gleeful trip through the frenzied mind of a world-class artist who is now single-handedly redefining genre cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tHnLFWSc5jcNioeay3GwbfLgvbi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Made in Ugana: The Very Special Seance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
