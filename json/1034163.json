After settling there more than 70 years ago, the Hasidim are a rapidly growing minority group which today represents about 23% of Outremont’s population.​Thanks to unprecedented access to this self-isolated community, the film lifts the veil on its practices, traditions, music and life as they had never before been seen on Canadian television, without ignoring the community’s expectations, fears. and hopes.","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/zr4vDkB7g7PIXZ0W0AJADOAMe2V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":183961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Menemsha Films","origin_country":""},{"id":9115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Radio-Canada","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":183964,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions des Quatre Jeudis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outremont et les Hassidim","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
