The video consists of a  series of long and fixed shots in which it is possible to perceive a mysterious  and elusive creature. Observation soon becomes contemplation and  meditation in which the gaze is lost in the image in search of the enigmatic  presence. The title of the work and the name of the (non) protagonist derive  from the dialectal name of the rat snake, a very common non-poisonous  snake near water courses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n5sFQFshQy2eZAPL34olc6Tw1dx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"il carbonasso","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
