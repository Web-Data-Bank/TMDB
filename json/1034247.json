The film is structured as a long walk through the city in  which the exit from the scene corresponds to the total disappearance of the  person. Sometimes the subject is more evident, other times it mingles in the  crowd or appears in a few pixels in the distance. The edges of the picture  are also the limits of the image, which can be easily crossed but which, in  the case of these videos, become openings to the unknown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fsFAqBGwnUcztvq9IcyAZOb2F63.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last seen walking","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
