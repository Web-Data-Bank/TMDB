It was the the Carnegie Hall magic all over again and this time we had a camera crew to capture the entire event -- available now for the first time on this DVD. The repertoire is mostly from the We'll Be Together Again album, with the special bonus of the newly-constituted Basie band. This was to be Lena's final concert performance and in every respect it's a stunning summation to a most extraordinary career.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gvQzNbNMvWGsmcQc56KgCTxGPFU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening With Lena Horne","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
