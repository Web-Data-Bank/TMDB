This is followed by a range of subjects, mostly shot with an unmoving camera: hermit crabs on a beach, strips of paper arranged on the bed of a scanning photocopier, bare feet moving among metal rods on roughly poured concrete, the city of Los Angeles at different times of day, someone playfully maneuvering a power washer, a disco ball casting confettilike reflections, bodies touching, a worker at a construction site, and light on the surface of water, abstracted by darkness.
