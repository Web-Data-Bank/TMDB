Bressan, Jr.","overview":"In Passing Strangers, a closeted gay teenager (Robert Adams) finds love, community and a political awakening when he decides to answer a personal ad from an older, jaded man (Robert Carnagey). One of cinema's first coming out stories, Passing Strangers is a romantic portrait of gay liberation-era San Francisco that still resonates today.  Robert Adams returns in Forbidden Letters as Larry, a man trying to pass time on the day his older lover Richard (Richard Locke) is set to be released from prison. Unable to clear his head through casual sex, he reads through his letters to Richard - letters he could never send out of fear that his outing would lead to a harsher sentence. As Richard's release draws nearer, the question remains: will the spark still be there when he gets out?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ovX6FP5GizucHVNuj19yb5Lw1c7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Altered Innocence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Films by Arthur J.
