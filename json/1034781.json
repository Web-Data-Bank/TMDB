When Reg and his beautiful French Canadian wife Claire have their “miracle child”, Viviane is raised as an heir to the historic Winthrop exceptionalism and finds pride in her career in dentistry. After she is contacted by an unknown relative through their Ancestry DNA test, Viviane embraces her new identity, where she finds peace after facing powerful themes about love, blood and family.","popularity":1.189,"poster_path":"/riXb2aiFbIsUVSg89FOEaKMZ07H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if everything you believed about yourself was a lie?","title":"The Last of the Winthrops","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
