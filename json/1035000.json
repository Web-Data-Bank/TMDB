For two friends, Nina Faure and Yéléna Perret, it starts with an awareness. With a few others, they ask themselves why, in a society that claims that gender equality is already there, access to pleasure is so difficult. They organized discussion groups, discovered Our Bodies, Ourselves, a historical feminist manual that opened new doors of analysis. They met with teachers, educators and sociologists to draw up step by step what would end up being a real plan of attack. More and more involved in the struggles that are taking place everywhere, at the heart of this feminist movement that is sweeping the world, they discover a pleasure that was unsuspected until now, that of pursuing a collective emancipation. The pleasure of abolishing patriarchy, quite simply.","popularity":0.725,"poster_path":"/vkLeObQMxlqzyLYLLW3rcWxKbHF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Chronicle of a feminist revolution.","title":"We Are Coming, chronique d’une révolution féministe","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
