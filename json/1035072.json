His failures in the baccalaureate and in the competitions to become a steward or postman opened up another path for him. Inspired by the music of Laurent Voulzy, he used the words that floated in his head and became the poet of life. This mixture of sweet melancholy and humor, his imagination and his sense of observation, this strong bond with the public have given him, in fifty years of career, a special place in the French musical landscape. It is his story and his repertoire filled with hits that his relatives, friends and musicians reveal here, including his sons Pierre and Charles, Laurent Voulzy, Michel Jonasz, Louis Chedid, Thierry Lhermitte, but also Jane Birkin, Vincent Delerm and Edward Baer.","popularity":0.671,"poster_path":"/Am0hZ4BeVwsqDe5Yv4QvITfRzom.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105852,"logo_path":"/8496jx3PA1EABhAO33sRy7zN49P.png","name":"Magnéto Presse","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The soundtrack of his life","title":"Alain Souchon - One Day, One Fate","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
