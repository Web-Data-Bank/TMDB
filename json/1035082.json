We see local residents, some homeless; junkyards and empty lots; the facade of a bar. Footage from a medical training film and images from an exercise video, filmed off TV, are intercut. The sound track is a similarly dense collage of music fragments and spoken texts from various sources. The film is divided into seven numbered and titled sections.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poverties","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
