This fast-paced tale centers around the lives of three beautiful seniors and the individual men in their lives in an era where European-made cars and designer clothes not only defined a generation, but also their very social status. Mya, Takia and Raven form a unique friendship, each girl from totally different backgrounds come together and make a united sisterhood, but it gets tested to the core by the allure of the streets and handsome young drug dealers with enough money to make every materialistic fantasy come true, but dreams quickly turn into nightmares as each girl is brought in deeper into the violent, cold hearted world of the Philadelphia streets where pretty young things can quickly get squashed like a grape.","popularity":1.497,"poster_path":"/j1aZrl6QDA6BHwUSxxSoJxuqQpy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fatally Flawless","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
