A sign that there was something in the village at the far east. Widya, Nur, Ayu, Bima, Anton and Wahyu never thought that their KKN activities would lead to disaster.  Often heard the sound of gamelan and the appearance of a beautiful dancer who began to disturb Nur and also Widya. \"Badarawuhi\", the village elder (Mbah Buyut) mentions the name of the dancer who continues to be unemployed Widya. An even scarier incident occurred when one of the KKN students was entangled in an agreement with the dancer, so that they were threatened with not being able to return home safely from the village known as the Dancer Village.","popularity":4.598,"poster_path":"/9looDRc5E3nR8pusInJEZoBYCYO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5344,"logo_path":null,"name":"MD Pictures","origin_country":"ID"},{"id":104856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pichouse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Javanese","iso_639_1":"jv","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KKN di Desa Penari: Luwih Dowo, Luwih Medeni","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
