These persons are between 17 and 70 years old. The film highlights their stories of life’s different journeys. One describes themself as a binary trans person, another as a man with trans experiences and a third as neither a man nor a woman but non-binary, beyond gender. One may dream of the day when the gender confirmation surgery is complete while another feels it’s enough to express their gender using hormones.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c95eVhpxC8OfjA2xNjYxdZv1P0U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Just Want to Come Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
