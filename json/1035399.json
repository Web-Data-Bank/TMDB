The story follows Sean, who is, as he says, “new to this whole open universe.” When Kai, Max’s “hot little dancer hook-up,” unexpectedly shows up at Sean’s door to help with the move, Sean finds himself going through feelings of intimidation, attraction, and skepticism toward Kai. As Sean moves through his conflicting desires, the film moves through different film genres—film-noir, ‘70s gay porn, and period melodramas—until we shift to Kai’s perspective at the end.","popularity":0.699,"poster_path":"/bHa9I4ASrksghwmpXSKf5eB6t6T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moving","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
