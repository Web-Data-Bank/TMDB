Mesmerized and curious to find who his girl is he aimlessly wanders around Chicago to find her. He asks friends and strangers. And comes out with no answers.  On the verge of giving up, he starts to follow a person who he thinks resembles the girl that is in the photo. The pretty girl holding a peace sign in the photo is the girl he starts following. The boy is run over by a car because he was so distracted by the photo.  In the end, the girl in the photo disappears as she is a ghost and the peace sign she was holding in the photo changes to her holding three fingers up, as the hand was never making a peace sign but showing a count.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9K5fZRGafXLpG5aKhfmWmq9lidH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193767,"logo_path":"/AcxtPZwMl0qc3BpFzeIvafC6V99.png","name":"Carlos Lerma Original Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A photo finds a boy.","title":"Wish We Never Met","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
