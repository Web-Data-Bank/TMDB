A home atlas of wonders that are sometimes misunderstood and of places known, loved and often lost.  And of people cultured in their living in a highly stratified territory, between the still usable grandeur of the past and the apparent stasis of the present.  A country marked by strong inequalities and nevertheless in continuous transformation in the difficult race towards sustainable development, problematically suspended between the old and the new and the increasingly difficult search for a balance to safeguard its Ã©thos.","popularity":0.616,"poster_path":"/8Wdt6zGCHVhFuGlLDWUG3VajdXX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amate Sponde","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
