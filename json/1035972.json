It’s exactly what you think it is. Every year we go through thousands of dog videos and put together a 75 minute reel of the best, funniest, most touching and most surprising canine vids we can find. This reel plays in theaters around the globe and raises money for local dog shelters and animal welfare organizations. Then at the end of the year, we start all over and do it again!
