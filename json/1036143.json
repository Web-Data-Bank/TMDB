For various reasons, separating victims is difficult or impossible, whether it's financial dependence or fear of the unknown. The principle of indebtedness — divorce through the fault of the partner - is still a current topic in many divorce proceedings. Many fathers struggle with the injustices (high payments, manipulating ex-wives, estrangement of the children, existential problems) after a divorce, to which they are often exposed for no reason and which are neither a support to the parents nor their children. Violence knows no gender, faith, origin, age, social class or professional group. It can happen to anyone!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shards of Our Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
