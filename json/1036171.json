In his documentary STOP FILMING US (2020), set in the city of Goma in DRC, Dutch filmmaker Joris Postema examined the link between stereotypes and this skewed balance of power. After a screening of STOP FILMING US in Goma, the audience wondered if the film could tell a different story using the same footage. Together with producer Ganza Buroko, filmmakers Bernadette Vivuya and Kagoma Twahirwa re-edited the footage to make a version that better reflects their perspective and does justice to their own experiences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stop Filming Us But Listen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
