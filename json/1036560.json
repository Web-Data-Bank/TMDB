The film is based on the personal narratives of six individuals who fled their native countries in response to a range of difficult situations: Sarah Ezzat Mardini, who escaped war-torn Syria; José Maria João, a former child soldier from Angola; Mamy Maloba Langa, a rape survivor from the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Shabeena Francis Saveri, a transgender activist from India; Luis Ernesto Nava Molero, a political dissident from Venezuela; and Farah Abdi Mohamed, an idealistic young atheist from Somalia. Breitz filmed each of the six participants telling their stories in the places where they were seeking or had been granted asylum (Berlin, New York and Cape Town). Fragments from the six interviews are woven into a fast-paced montage featuring American film stars Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
