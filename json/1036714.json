Over the next three decades, untold thousands of children (and adults too!) were thrilled by a mix of innovative, exciting and stunning extravaganzas!  For many fans, these exhibitions were their first and only real chance to get close-up to their favourite TV programme … and the memories they share in this innovative documentary series are bound together by interviews with experts and people who actually worked at them!  The museum re-opened in 2021 after extensive restoration work and we tell the story of that opening … and the incredible journey that led to that memorable day!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/44LJ47Bj29dz0rTKR6bobrJd9Cz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor on Display: The Museum of Classic Sci-Fi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
