The film ends on the esplanade of Boulevard de la Croix-Rousse and the Gros Caillou of glacial origin that is climbed by children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j2RCqHCIrmJNvZhmWN8mpbOCGzE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Deux Lyon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
