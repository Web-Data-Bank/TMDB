The film is a farewell to the vanishing world of the traditional Ruthenian community in the hills of eastern Slovakia. Metaphorically, a farewell to the personal worlds which are fading with the death of each of our ancestors. Visually highly subjective, dream-like black and white imagery brings the audience into the world of memory and inter-looping past and present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strigov","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
