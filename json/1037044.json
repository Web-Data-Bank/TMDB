His family now care for his every need 24 hours a day. This intimate documentary starkly illustrates the love, support and challenges faced by his wife Lindsey, children Macy, Maya and Jackson, and parents Geoff and Irene.  There are moments of intimacy as Lindsey takes Rob for a swim or carries him up to bed, and there are moments of humour as Rob uses his voice box to tease his mum as she feeds him. Rob is seen discussing his treatment with the NHS staff caring for him while best friend and former teammate mate Kevin Sinfield continues to rally support in Leeds, the home of Leeds Rhinos, and from the wider rugby league community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cOPqUUwqgeVffjIWzw3wgBDBhfN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rob Burrow: Living with MND","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
