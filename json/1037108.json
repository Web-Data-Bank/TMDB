The plot is organized around a ‘heist’ narrative in which the data extracted by data capitalist and bioeconomic platforms is re-appropriated and redistributed as visas and passports. This project dialogues with and pays homage to a lineage of cyberfeminist, blackfeminist, queer marxist and net.art works that have visibilised and appropriated reproductive work as a site of struggle, creativity, love and resistance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2U7F9SSzYlX1gYGTDYU8BoPttgw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wife of Them All","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
