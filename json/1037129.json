Set in the American suburbs, the film follows a neighbourhood through these years as consensus reality disintegrates into conspiracies and other political contagions. Part political satire, zombie stoner film, and Greek tragedy, the work is also informed by the encrypted memetics of contemporary internet culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rBmRPh8CnOwkqQqjzGccZ6jhmSh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soda Jerk","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello Dankness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
