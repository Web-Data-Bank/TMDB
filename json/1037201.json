For millions of people; however, the Soviet dream became a nightmare. After all these years since its collapse, what still remains of the Soviet Union? How can one approach the complex history of the mighty Soviet empire today? Henrike Sandner (*1971 in Dresden) answers these questions in a very personal film. Her film episodically follows the history of the Soviet Union and the Soviet myths of greatness, heroes, new people and a new Soviet culture, based on her own story. The film lasts 52 minutes and spans the years 1917 to 1991 - a story of contrasts that juxtaposes different perspectives and realities. Private archive footage and photos contrast with \"official\" news, Soviet film material or DEFA film classics. A \"short\" and personal history of the Soviet Union.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Bye, Sowjetunion!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
