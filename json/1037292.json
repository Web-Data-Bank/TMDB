Yes, it will be a completely different movie, but it will be.  Returning home, Maxim discovers an extremely unusual phenomenon: instead of a mat in speech, he hears a piercing \"piiip\", and instead of naked body parts — black \"patches\" and a fuzzy image. And even alcohol has lost its taste and degree. It seems that Maxim has become the main source of censorship for himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/S59LFD8KBoW2F0vd4ZVttkGEP6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How the F(pip)ck Happened to Maxim","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
