Here, we meet one particular polar bear, who has rented out a freezer to live in. The freezer is cold, silent and dark – almost like the arctic. Only if it wasn’t full of food in plastic packaging. One day the freezer is too full, and the polar bear has to escape his new home. The warm, heated kitchen is not a suitable habitat for a polar bear. It is up to a little girl to help out the poor bear. Will she be able to find a solution to fix the problem?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":199995,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sun \u0026 Moon Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bearly Functional","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
