Luck? Power? Wisdom? Or maybe all this individually does more harm than it helps? The God of Wisdom comes to a Person who has given up his hands and his life and promises to fulfill any desire related to wisdom. But, in the heavenly office, something was messed up (not without the participation of the God of Fun) and instead of one person, the God of Luck, the God of Fun and the God of War also come to the person.
