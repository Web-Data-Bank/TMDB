A veteran journalist father, a policeman son and an activist daughter are living in a torn society of Hong Kong. The trios in the Suen family are caught off-guard by the teasing of Moerae, or the Goddess of Destiny. In philately, \"tête-bêche\", or head-to-tail in English, is used to referred to a pair of generic stamps which is inverted in relation to one another, either through a printing error or intentionally. The stamps are of special value only when they are unseparated. Metaphorically, \"tête-bêche\" can precisely reflected the portrayed family's tricky situation, that different role-plays or value judgments can lead to sparkling tension among family members, yet somehow the old saying of \"blood is thicker than water\" prevails.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yUrrcrUK9j21VYmi7gnCzfl2IKe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head-to-tail","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
