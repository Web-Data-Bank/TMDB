Four colorful characters meet in necessarily bizarre circumstances. After a period of mutual distrust, they gradually get used to each other and even end up finding a common passion, music. No doubt because music knows how to give a soul to our hearts, strong bonds are forged between the characters. Along the way, they try to manage the present, finding \"original\" ways to deal with material necessities. But the past is not always so easily forgotten. So many things escape us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vrXgqk0qI5XyDBEJCub4HMlQDRN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les choses qui nous échappent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
