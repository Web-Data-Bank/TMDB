As the party continues, she retreats and climbs the roof alone. Memories from last year's Birthday begin to flood her thoughts and the trip down memory lane begins. How much something that has long since ended can hurt us. Because we dwell on thoughts of things that don't exist. Acceptance of the past and reconciliation with what happened is now all we ask.  PS: \"I take pictures to remember. I write to remember. I don't like to forget, I often reminisce, I always try to remember.\"\r The film was made in the context of the 5th Panorama Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with the theme DEACTIVATION.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/76ymfuLbnoWkyhb4KU9iHOVG2WS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178672,"logo_path":"/8joqZUDTpKoP3fNlUgIULcCZueX.png","name":"Panorama Film School of A.U.Th.","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":178474,"logo_path":"/AvEu3FUJOiul65MTD74MQmQckQi.png","name":"Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birthday Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
