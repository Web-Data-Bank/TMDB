Yu Kai's weaponry prowess and renowned female comedian Tam Lan-hing cross-dressing as a male general are also brilliant in this gem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":184571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gin Lei Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1968-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Heroine Fan Lei-fa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
