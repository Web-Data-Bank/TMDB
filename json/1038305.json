Ahead of his time in many ways, especially as an environmentalist, he is the longest-serving governor in the history of California, who eliminated the state’s billion-dollar deficit and enacted historic environmental and criminal justice reforms. From his early days in San Francisco as the son of Governor Pat Brown to his current work around climate change and nuclear threats, Zenovich’s timely film proposes a hopeful alternative to the current political morass.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wOY6u5IpeaI5WcsdbOR4q6FEh1t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jerry Brown: The Disrupter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
