A radically imaginative film that uses all possible cinematographic means to make the romances, conflicts and questionings of these actors palpable with lightness, literally sucking us in with them in a baroque drama with fairy-tale overtones. Through the themes of homosexuality, eroticism and the relationship to the body, Inside My Heart questions the way we look at things and what we might take for granted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fPQJOsiZdfEaNh1C4IgAPNzVMWg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Witfilm","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside My Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
