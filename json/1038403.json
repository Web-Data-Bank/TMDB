It culminated in an album released worldwide on October 11, 2005,[1] entitled The All-Star Sessions. Four \"team captains\" were chosen to lead 57 artists from 45 past and present Roadrunner bands, and produce and oversee the album's 18 tracks: then-Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison, Trivium frontman and guitarist Matt Heafy, Fear Factory guitarist Dino Cazares, and Machine Head frontman and guitarist Robb Flynn. The project was the brainchild of Roadrunner UK general manager Mark Palmer and Roadrunner USA VP of A&R Monte Conner. The album project was coordinated by Lora Richardson and was mixed by Colin Richardson and Andy Sneap. The All-Star Sessions spawned one single and music video (\"The End\"). The DVD included with the CD purchase is a documentary of the \"Making Of\" the songs. It features the sessions of the four team captains making their songs.[2]","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oSD6khJICJOSAa7gcD3LpefN7qr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roadrunner United: The Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
