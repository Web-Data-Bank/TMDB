The format of actuality filming using hand-held camerawork, was ground-breaking for its time and many future series developed the idea in years to come.  The premise involved taking children to see the kind of careers they could take on when they left school. From oil Rig Workers to Air Crew - the list was endless!  This pilot programme, featuring a vet Francis Anthony and a soundtrack by composer Mark Ayres, was submitted to Carlton television and the series so nearly made it to commissioning!  Buried in the Reeltime Pictures archive for over 20 years, we’ve now brought it out, dusted it down and present it here, with a brand new introduction from Sophie and Keith.  Sit back and enjoy the pilot - and wonder at what might have been!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AmzrfzcZImlQpLvwLWhdl6k9hlo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sophie’s Choice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
