He was born on March 10, 1917 in Yuzovka, now Donetsk. The real name of the photographer is Yefim Khaldei. He was called Evgeny at the TASS agency, where he began his career as a 19-year-old boy. He went through the entire Great Patriotic War from Murmansk to Berlin with the legendary Leica camera in his hands. He was fired from TASS in 1948 on the grounds of “the fifth paragraph”. He worked in obscurity, so that that time would not be forgotten. And it seems that he forgave the time everything, the murder of his parents, humiliation and indifference.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside the Photograph","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
