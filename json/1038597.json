His reflections are connected by songs that address miscellaneous news and social issues with egalitarian verve, sung by hot guys in a public toilet. A film full of meandering associations and unexplained references, it's at the same time a political musical and the taking stock of a romantic revolutionary. Anti-religious, anti-authoritarian and somehow also a bit anti-everything!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v4F0q9F2J99qLIPtB0noOd90u7I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klappe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
