She would soon become a key figure of the Harlem Renaissance, best remembered for her novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God. But even as she gained renown in the Harlem literary circles, Hurston was also discovering anthropology at Barnard College with the renowned Franz Boas. She would make several trips to the American South and the Caribbean, documenting the lives of rural Black people and collecting their stories. She studied her own people, an unusual practice at the time, and during her lifetime became known as the foremost authority on Black folklore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zora Neale Hurston: Claiming A Space","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
