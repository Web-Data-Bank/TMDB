Первый после Гагарина","overview":"Gagarin's surname is known all over the world. The name Titov is not familiar to everyone today. But it could have been the other way around. Herman Titov could become the first cosmonaut of the planet! But just two days before the start, he was appointed Yuri Gagarin's understudy. Before that, they were on a par and, according to experts, Titov was ready to fly better than Gagarin. We will learn about why the world fame did not go to Titov, but Gagarin from the person closest to Titov — his widow Tamara. We also learn from her about the Titov family drama — the death of the firstborn, which could influence the decision of which of the two worthy ones to fly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74087,"logo_path":null,"name":"VSTRECHA Studio","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":1039,"logo_path":"/vTDwphEW5Ikiqu6UxrRCzhfFcVo.png","name":"First Channel","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2010-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herman Titov.
