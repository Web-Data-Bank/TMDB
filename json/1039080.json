Here, in the district of Alamar, a 26-acre farming co-op provides employment for dozens of workers, while producing vegetables and medicinal plants for the local community and beyond. TIERRALISMO introduces us to everyone from agronomists and senior management to workers who plant, plow, and propagate. The film also covers non-farming aspects of the operation, such as human resources and accounting practices where transparency is paramount.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uLu6OZJ8nTBLdcYCcAC6YF2HmET.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tierralismo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
