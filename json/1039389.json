This song was originally intended to criticize the blind obedience of Nigerian soldiers and their actions were to censor his music, which was considered too controversial and too critical of the political power of the time (1977). What interested me with this work was to immerse myself in a universe where the representation of my body could be a victim of projections from an imaginary specific to Africa, specific to the clich√©s linked to the colonial era. And at the same time, to find strategies of appropriation of Afrobeat, a genre linked to the music of Fela Kuti, rich in terms of musical instruments, in spite of the limits that my deafness could cause.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2R6MvWVPcQ1rTwvVWYwpmA71jIX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ZOMBIIIIE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
