This poem will become a play performed several times at the Grand Théâtre and in Moorea by the Pupu Arioi. In 1978, the Matarau cinema unit was created at the Maison des Jeunes et de la Culture. The first film in this department will be an adaptation of the play.  In his book \"Autonomous Tahiti\", Philippe Mazelier defines the piece as follows: \"The theme is classic, the parabola transparent: as long as it was faithful to ancestral convictions, Ariipaea passed from the world of men to the world of gods, and Maohi culture was alive. When she converted, the gods stopped speaking to her, and Tahitian culture died. To revive it implies for Henri Hiro to fight Western culture. He calls for a return to basics against the consumer society while the latter, at the same time, is working twice as hard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1YEDdYLtTQmmIiKmza6QSdOgoZD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PF","name":"French Polynesia"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tahitian","iso_639_1":"ty","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ariipaea Vahine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
