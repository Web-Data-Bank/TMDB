The film opens with the family in Brooklyn, but following the death of one of Frankie's siblings, they return home, only to find the situation there even worse. Prejudice against Frankie's Northern Irish father makes his search for employment in the Republic difficult despite his having fought for the IRA, and when he does find money, he spends the money on drink.","popularity":9.001,"poster_path":"/3Zzcys11nAPP14sKW9l97fIHhkK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1382,"logo_path":"/sOg7LGESPH5vCTOIdbMhLuypoLL.png","name":"PolyGram Filmed Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":903,"logo_path":null,"name":"David Brown Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":81128,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dirty Hands Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scott Rudin Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-25","revenue":13042112,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angela's Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":7.251,"vote_count":261}
