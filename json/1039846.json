It was an oppressive situation, as if she were in a box that prescribed the limits of her existence. She has been living in the Netherlands for two years now. She has found a way out of her repressed existence and now stands in the spotlight with her own choreography. Allen takes you into her story with her dance: This is me. She wants to show people that you donâ€™t have to let people decide for you what they have in mind for you. Instead, you should show who you are and follow your own heart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
