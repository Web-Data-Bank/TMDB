The first shot of BILDWERDEN frames the Austrian artist Isolde Maria Joham, now 90, off-center, her hands shaking. Christiana Perschon (SHE IS THE OTHER GAZE) allows her a new gesture: to climb a stair frame and pose, smiling in front of her large canvases. Isolde trembles a little, but so does the bird we see alighting on a branch, as do the stairs themselves; nothing in this world is fixed rigid. As the filmmaker says to Isolde, happily: “Now you’ve outgrown the frame”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zhFEfrqoiKmKNtK9K4AvgObiNlI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2023-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bildwerden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
