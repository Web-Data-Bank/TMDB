It is an endearing story about two friends, Jon and Josh (played by Jas. Townsend & Sonâ€™s very own Jon Townsend and Joshua King), who unwittingly serve in the Continental Army in the Ohio wilderness under the command of a tyrannical commander. Jon is begrudgingly bound to Josh by a childhood promise to keep Josh safe from the trouble that seems to hound him at every turn. The tension between this promise and self preservation finally reaches a breaking point as the two find themselves falling deeper into danger.  Crimson Bond is a fictional tale, not a documentary. Its theme of friendship, loyalty, and redemption, combined with a bit of lighthearted humor in the midst of darker circumstances, is intended to entertain the entire family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tormented by a memory.
