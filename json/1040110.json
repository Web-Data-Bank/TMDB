It is said that you can get rewards from suspicious real estate companies and owners. Kureki decided to live in the room where the murder occurred. The former resident was a woman who was an office worker and was stalked by a certain man. He seems to have consulted the police several times, but he was repeatedly stalked by a man without any proper measures, and it seems that he was finally killed. One night, about two months after he started living in the room, Kureki was finally attacked directly by a spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v6l5hAQpRQHUGbvA6KR7LEIhzwW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184894,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMG Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curse [Noroie] House 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
