These motifs frame eight intertwining tragic love stories, the setting of which are modern Russian fishing villages of old believers on the border of Estonian-Russian settlements and cultures by Lake Peipsi. The spiritualization of everything living and inanimate from Japanese animism, the eroticism of shunga and the humble language of prayer merge into a spiritual and magical world of a small community, where one still believes that one is connected with everything.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":79811,"logo_path":"/jSzhkuSGhdQtKulhYDGNS4Ig01E.png","name":"Bufo","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"8 Views of Lake Biwa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
