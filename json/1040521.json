In this cinematographic essay, Rolf Orthel looks for the meaning of creating, with reality or the memory of it as a starting point and a train journey as a meandering ribbon through the film. We see the first musical steps of primary school children and youngsters at Jeugdtheaterschool Zuid-Oost. We see what talent does to you when a conservatory student practices for his graduation, when someone paints a remarkable self-portrait or when Konvooi creates a thrilling play. This is high-level creation which makes you wonder how on earth it is possible that you can suddenly be enchanted and moved. The conclusion of Orthelâ€™s search? Creating things is the best.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xDZeXCQ7BLf00FO9LPJW9Aqjpz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doc.Eye Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creating things is the best","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
