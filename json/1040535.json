The film was based on a musical show of the same title that opened at the Lewisham Hippodrome on 19 March 1928, in which Jack Buchanan also starred. The music was written by Joseph Meyer and Phil Charig, with lyrics by Douglas Furber. The film omitted much of music of the original show, but popularised one song in particular, Fancy our Meeting. The song remained a Jack Buchanan favourite and a version of it was also recorded by Al Bowlly shortly after the film's release.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1933-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That's a Good Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
