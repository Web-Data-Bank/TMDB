The Ukrainian village of Stuzhytsya is situated in the Carpathian Mountains in the border triangle between Poland and Slovakia. The three elderly female protagonists – a farmer, a post office clerk and a biologist – are firmly rooted in a place where hardly any young people are left in 2019, the year of Zelensky’s election victory. Over time, the film crew also becomes, at least temporarily, a valued part of the village community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jY2Ond2Hd9VqE6fe9c5XiB2x8TO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86782,"logo_path":"/zuXKoPd9apgEOvy6rHthcEjJkR7.png","name":"Filmuniversität Babelsberg Konrad Wolf","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Women","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
