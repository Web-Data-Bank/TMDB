The Furnish Collection includes trains and planes, cars and zeppelins, stuffed animals, games and banks, toy soldiers, robots (He plays with one worth $25,000), Erector sets, a fleet of boats and more.\r Bill takes us on a tour, making the toys come alive by telling stories and relating the toys to the times in which they were made - all with great style, wit and Ã©lan. Bill believed toys were important because they perpetuated the joys of childhood.  \"Bill was fantastic,\" remembers Dale Kelly, publisher of Antique Toy World, \"He lit up a room. He was a great storyteller and he loved to share his vast knowledge of the toys.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/saEfyOm634T2DPqN1Og6qSXLn7K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toys of the Past The William Furnish Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
