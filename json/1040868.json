This situation allows the author to demonstrate the conflict from a broad tour of the occupied territory, with the freedom of being a foreigner. Above you can hear Palestinian descendants from Chile – home to the largest Palestinian community living outside the Middle East – who from their own subjectivity reflect on the future of Palestine, as well as on their own memories.","popularity":0.846,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2015-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ana men Chile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
