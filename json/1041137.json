In Nun and Deviant the performers come to happier terms with their identities both as women and as artists. As Angelo and Compton don and dismantle stereotypical guises before the camera/viewer, Nun and Deviant explores how repressive representations circulating in our culture are formulated as opposites such as Madonna-whore (nun-deviant)â€”cliches that force women to assume restrictive, paradoxical roles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nun and Deviant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
