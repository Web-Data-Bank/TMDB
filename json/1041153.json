The documentary follows Benedikt in his working and living environment, exploring the relationship between tools, the body, and the material world, in a sensual, haptic exchange, influenced by Hartmut Rosaâ€™s concept of resonance: what might a resonant relationship to the world look like? The notion of listening gives an important clue: listening to the world as a whole, hearing voices other than human ones. Benedikt is a quiet, documentary portrait that gives the viewers time to reflect on themes such as life plan, loneliness, connections, and romance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3rBes8lkJfXcJSLB5Oudc9RAJ0E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benedikt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
