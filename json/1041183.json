The men around her, whose lives she forever alters, are Johan Reuter as newspaper publisher Dr. Schön; Daniel Brenna as his composer son, Alwa; Paul Groves as the Painter; and Franz Grundheber as Schigolch. Susan Graham sings Countess Geschwitz, and Lothar Koenigs conducts Berg’s landmark score.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6j6BZGlHa2CWkLTIpbaB0tFE2US.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"},{"id":180947,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Metropolitan Opera High-Definition Production","origin_country":""},{"id":5033,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nonesuch Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":182,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berg: Lulu","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
