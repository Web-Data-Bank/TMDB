In 2019, Hong Kong government plans to introduce a law permitting the extradition of criminal suspects to Mainland China sparked a mass protest movement unprecedented in scale. The people of Hong Kong marched - 1 million strong, then 2 million - to save what they saw as the city's eroding freedoms and rule of law. When their demands went unheeded, the protests intensified, and the streets of Hong Kong became soaked in tear gas and blood as valiant frontline protesters clashed with riot police. Behind the frontliners stood a peaceful silent majority, committed to a hard-won solidarity as they attempt to save the city that they love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9eFieEakjkhMiqF4VCHxVVyDnvk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2022-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love in the Time of Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
