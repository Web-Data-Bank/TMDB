Featuring Super-8 films Charlie shot as a teenager in the 1970s up to the last film he made about his battle with AIDS related lymphoma. Charlie AKA Clublum was a much-loved and valued member of our queer and film community, whose films defied the taboos and stigmas of sex, sex in public places and sex with HIV. His films embody a quirky earnestness and a wacky and wicked sense of humor and always the utter delight and pleasure of another body.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eR8s7MLqW10vOvR8unA2Z3uHBbT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-28","revenue":500,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Where I Get Off","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
