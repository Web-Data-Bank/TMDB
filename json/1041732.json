It's a great Easter story, an animated fairy tale about a witch kid and what she's up to in the orphanage while the mother witch whips around with her broom. An excellent animated fairy tale about diversity and tolerance, made in Camilla Mickwitz's typical funny way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":141788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epidem Oy","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1983-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mimosa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
