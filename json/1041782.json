The saga of the Bergers continues as Puscifer pairs the duo’s ongoing melodrama with a live, track-by-track re-imagination of the band’s critically-acclaimed 2011 album, Conditions of My Parole. Visually, “Parole Violator” is evocative of Keenan’s North Arizona homestead, with Puscifer’s performance married to striking visuals, dramatic lighting, and in a nod to the band’s 2011/2012 tour in support of the collection, closes with a campfire sing-a-long.","popularity":1.499,"poster_path":"/iO8RkcPCShfJjlYiuMuJwkgjCE1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puscifer - Parole Violator","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
