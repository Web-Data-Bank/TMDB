The documentary is about the rarely known stories in the social movement in June. At first the clips of videos were kept for sorting out my feelings, but after being edited, they were made into a documentary and became a record of history. Six scenes and voices were used to tell what happened during that month.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4xXZX9HFUs2p94klI26eJQ3gvWp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"June","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
