Moments later, a diamond thief with a voice similar to Heiji's accidentally calls the Mouri Detective Agency asking for a ransom. Soon realizing that he has dialed the wrong number, the caller hangs up, but not before a familar voice says \"Good morning!\" on the other line. Conan deducts that the caller had meant to dial a similar number, and calls Heiji over to mimick his voice and call a list of similar numbers. Only one person responds; Iwatsume. The detectives approach him and question him to discover that the man had paid 10,000,000 yen to retrieve his stolen jewel. After realizing the meager ransom, which was a tenth of the value of the diamond, it is discovered that the returned gem was a fake.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Follow the Vanished Diamond!
