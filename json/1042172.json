Central is a range of anthropomorphous characters voicing their conflicting perspectives on consent and complicity. An adaptation of Millais' Ophelia comes back to life through karaoke. A white male default 3D avatar generates empty buzzwords to apologize for being involved in issues of harassment. A singing ensemble of oysters share their concerns about the abuse of power, allegorically hinting at their gendered, art-historical, and ecological connotations. The Aquatic Apes are depicted as otherworldly mid-evolution creatures with sexualized and animalistic features, and vocalized dolphin-like sounds translated into subtitles. Connecting all characters is the reference to water as a unifying element, exposing its undeniable sexual, biological, and environmental interpretations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dQ2EntEv3wD4mN8GqFnhYUneDDN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BAIT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
