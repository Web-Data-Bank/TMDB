Her mirage has so besotted him that he roams around Manila hoping he would find her. He enlists the help of his best buddy Ruval (Oliver Lacson) who keeps reminding him to seek clues as to Diana’s whereabouts, “Maghanap ka ng mga palatandaan sa iyong panaginip para malaman natin ang lugar.” He then gathers his clues: lush vegetation, spring, bridge, and a lookout point where buildings are seen from a distance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p3nGdKEsn0FeZNa5jX5Owwdb10G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28413,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stallione Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imahinasyon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
