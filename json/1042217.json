As homicide detectives unravel the case, they discover the victims all have one thing in common: they’re crooked ex-cops who escaped justice. But they didn’t escape the sting of the Black Widow. As the investigation hits ever closer to home, the police must consider that the killer could be one of their own, a vigilante who is taking the law into her own hands, and tracking these murders will take them through the dark and seedy underbelly of Los Angeles where they soon discover that revenge is a dish best served hot.","popularity":2.731,"poster_path":"/ygZdi5lPWUOqVR2XYYnivnuGN0P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Surrender Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":4867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Full Moon Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You never stood a chance","title":"Sweet Sting of the Black Widow","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
