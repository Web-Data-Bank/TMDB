The daughter of an Orthodox Jewish peddler, Jonas was ordained in Berlin in 1935. During the Nazi era and the war, her sermons and her unparalleled devotion brought encouragement to the persecuted German Jews. Regina Jonas was murdered in Auschwitz in 1944. The only surviving photo of Jonas serves as a leitmotif for the film, showing a determined young woman gazing at the camera with self-confidence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/65BZc9KUhEWgbAilfEBEqcc99Eg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Katapult Film","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":185208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malcah","origin_country":""},{"id":185209,"logo_path":null,"name":"Time Prints Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2013-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regina","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
