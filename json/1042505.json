Since 1987 dialogues between Francisco Varela, other Western scientists and the Dalai Lama have been conducted regularly; with topics like healing and destructive emotions, the state of consciousness during sleeping, dreaming and dying etc.. These dialogues open up new paths of knowledge building bridges between Western scientific and Tibetan buddhist thinking, which are highly relevant and meaningful for today and for the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aZne7Hlq6eERpq3ohOVY0ieL7il.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ethics – Identity – Experience","title":"Mind & Life - Early Dialogues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
