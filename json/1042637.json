A bubble that bursts in the torrent. Thousands of birds shake the air. The storm rushes over the camera. How to represent a territory in our eyes unfathomable, in which everything changes and at the same time remains? Right there, between the detail and the panorama, between the short shots and the shots that seem to never end, the well-trodden “Argentine countryside” emerges in its elusive condition. A space filmed almost outside the human presence, in which words would be expendable except to mention an absent God.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How to represent a territory in our eyes unfathomable, in which everything changes and at the same time remains?","title":"The extension","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
