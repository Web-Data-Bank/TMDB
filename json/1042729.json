In this film, named after Vasari’s biography of Giorgione, man and woman reenact Manet and Titian, switch places, and in so doing, exchange their nudity and the gaze that seeks it. In voiceover, a woman reads a letter telling of her efforts to sign up her daughter in daycare ; other kafkaesque situations follow, drawing wth humour the picture of a life of submission to an absurd administrative power. In the frame, birds and their choreographies echo the wanderings of the two characters in the Camargue countryside.
