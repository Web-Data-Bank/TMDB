Before becoming a politically committed filmmaker, Mario Marret had been a resistance fighter, an anarchist activist, a radio operator, an explorator. Making his way in French anti-colonial activist circles, he moved closer to the PAIGC (the movement for independence in Guinea and Cape Verde), who was then interested in cinema as a combat tool. He will be the first director to join the struggle. “It was a testimony. Never mind the format, the camera, all these things, a filmmaker was present. The filmmaker must be at the place where the world is made, when it is made.
