It’s also a fascinating study of a psychological power struggle between a character comedian – Graham Fellows, and his long-standing creation – John Shuttleworth.  Father Earth is also about family relationships – specifically between fathers and sons –  and it explores the paradox: how in the battle against extinction we are often distracted by personal and family issues, as they appear more important and pressing than the future of the planet.  Funny yet moving, and filmed mainly in the Orkney Isles over a 10 year period, Father Earth is Graham Fellows’ most thoughtful and accomplished movie to date.  Previous work includes It’s Nice Up North filmed by Martin Parr (2004) and Southern Softies (2008)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
