Even with their limitations, they can unite into a solid and creative community to conquer all negative views of the general public in the past. All challenges and obstacles were overcome together to later grow into a music industry that we know today. It is this long-standing concern that is trying to be revived through the inspiration of previous successes.  GOR Saparua is a complete proof of the unyielding spirit displayed by Bandung music activists. Even Alvin, the director noted that the music event in Saparua had existed since 1963. It was started by Aneka Nada, a band that was strengthened by Sam and Acil Bimbo as well as Guruh Soekarno Putra. Until then its use is maximized by the next generation. Especially the 90's.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uwhXlG1uM2HCpzOct77jLT1dSD1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rich Music","origin_country":""},{"id":185292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hazed Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gelora: Magnumentary Of Gedung Saparua","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
