The Interrogation explores a mind-bending and often-psychedelic world where an all-powerful media company sets all the rules and demands religious-like devotion from its employees. In just 6 minutes, this short animation takes the audience on an unexpected ride full of twists and turns.  Based on the award-winning The Cloaked Realm Universe created by Peter Issac Alexander and Marisa L. Cohen, The Interrogation features hand-drawn animation, an original score by John Baxter, and sound design by Dara Crawford.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sHp0c4T4iPmqh0E34NASy46gdli.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Interrogation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
