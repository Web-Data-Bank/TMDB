The director uses a big range of forms and approaches, including slapstick, to build these crabs’ lives into an existential metaphor, which expands the method she already mastered in the previous film Dans le regard d’un bête. A modern poetic parable, between reality and fiction, open to the fragmentary diversity of reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Such a Long March","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
