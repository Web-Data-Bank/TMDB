This film documents his 2019 performance of Se (‘back’), a live poetry reading set against accompaniment from avant-garde rock group Kukan Gendai. Blindfolded and wearing a facemask, Yoshimasu plays audio recordings, growls and rasps his way through a rendition of a poem, and channels every ounce of his energy into drawing, using a pane of glass as his canvas. Kukan Gendai sculpt shapes of sound in response: an entire universe thrown into sharp relief by an uncompromising contest between voice and music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dPSDaiQ7AfiDm6Fjneuv69Cj4e2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"'Se'-back","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
