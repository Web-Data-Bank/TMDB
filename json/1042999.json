Focusing on the relation between the spoken word, the literary text and the act of listening, the film explores the writerâ€™s work with her own tools: words. As the war intensifies, the dilemma increases: to speak or not to speak becomes a central question in the film. But if the filmed conversations are interrupted, who will tell the story of the voiceless? A pertinent poetic and political testimony of our troubled times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Fields of Words","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
