From Ellida Geyra - Israel's first female fiction filmmaker, to contemporary female directors, the film weaves together a conglomerate of women's voices, as they echo each other, clash, and come apart, then culminate in a fiery speech by Ronit Elkabetz. Their stories create a diverse and cinematic patchwork quilt of female directors, providing us with a multifaceted reflection of any woman who wishes for her story to be heard. This is a moving documentary, that will motivate you to get up and do something about the glass ceiling, both the real one, as well as the imagined.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fq19RptU0iY0JVxINpNa7ZHSBoE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Director's Chair Sits a Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
