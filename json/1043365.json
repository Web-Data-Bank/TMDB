Every step must be perfect, every movement automatically leads to the next. Heavy chains have to be secured, nets reeled in, fish swiftly gutted and packed with ice into large boxes. A cigarette is always dangling from the lips and hopefully there’s always something left in the jar of chocolate cream. The camera moves in the same rolling beat as the ship in the waves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Days of Fishing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
