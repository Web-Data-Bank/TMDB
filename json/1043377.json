During his ordeal between depression, writer’s block, anger and urban loneliness, a story-teller is accompanied by three weird birds who sometimes appear as annoying neighbours, sometimes as inner demons. Jung, Freud and the psychologist Dr. Breuer in the shape of a grey cat promote self-reflection, but the most helpful thing is probably a beer with friends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World Is a House and There Are Rules in This House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
