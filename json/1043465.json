Angelika Andrees is interested in the individual acts presented in the ring, but even more in what happens before and afterwards. Or what the audience look like from below, when various bottoms are squashed on the wooden benches. Sometimes there’s clacking and knocking, or the pattering of rain, and in the end, Bob Dylan sings. “Travelling Circus” was made when Andrees was still at the Babelsberg Film Academy. She experiments with different elements, switches tones and thus captures the moods crystallising around the travelling attraction. A portrait emerges, without commentary and with very few, short interview sequences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travelling Circus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
