Whether melted down as tools of war or warning of danger – “Vivos Voco”, which also teaches us about the craft of bell founding, envelops us in an eery, monumental and epochal way. In her auto-fictional biography, Schütz writes about the collaboration with Osite-Krüger: “The two of us and the film, we were a team, we and the co-determinant images.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivos Voco – I Call the Living","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
