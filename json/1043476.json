Judging from my own example I can say: it’s been nothing but work, really nothing. I can really say that about me, stark and stiff.” Stralsund as the focal point of socialist conditions of value creation: A ship may be completed every two weeks, but housing, let alone leisure facilities aren’t. The diagnosis: The quality-of-life to performance ratio is less than ideal. The brigade’s team spirit, though, is still strong, even if, as some think, there are some shortcomings on the “ideological side”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Be Young, and What Else?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
