In this autobiographical documentary, Peter Mostovoy takes us on his journey from impoverished childhood to award-winning filmmaker. Naively believing that his art could be free from demands of the regime, Mostovoy nevertheless became entangled in the absurdity of Soviet-era politics as an “untrustworthy” Jew. The Red Scarf is a smart blend of animation, archival footage—including clips of Mostovoy’s films—and a healthy dose of humour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Scarf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
