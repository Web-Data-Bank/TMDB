It also has the unique distinction of having saved all 275 of its Jewish inhabitants during WWII. In this compelling story, Haim Konstantini, one of the survivors, narrates how the islanders united to ensure the survival of their Jewish population. Two key figures instrumental to the story were Mr. Loukas Kerreri, Mayor of Zakynthos’ capital, and Bishop Chrysostomos, who both refused to list the island’s Jews for the occupying Nazis. They have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations at Yad Vashem for their bravery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Will Smile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
