This is a club that has tasted just a brief touch of heaven and more than its fair share of hell. From the glory of that famous 1966 premiership through to years in turmoil, Heaven and Hell traces the story of one of the AFL’s great football clubs. On field heroes, off field battles. The great players like Baldock, Stewart, Ditterich, Smith, Barker, Lockett and Harvey playing against a backdrop of political tension. Originally released in 1997, this is an updated version produced for DVD. It now contains Harvey’s Brownlows, the 1997 finals campaign and the coaching crisis that saw Stan Alves, Tim Watson and Malcolm Blight leave the club.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rn8v0pVaGz0ANjKABLCtmz9JIBK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beyond Home Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2003-07-14","revenue":10000,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The History of the St Kilda Football Club","title":"Heaven & Hell: The History of the St Kilda Football Club","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
