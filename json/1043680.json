Described as \"...one of the greatest American dancers of our age,\" Lewitzky became a strong advocate for the arts, and the development of Los Angeles as a global dance center. Lewitzky's childhood was spent in San Bernardino, California. Surrounded by mountains, the desert landscape of this area will be used as a metaphor for her physical and emotional development as an artist. The wide-open spaces, textures, colors and sparse vistas mixed with a social consciousness instilled by her parents set the stage for her work and life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bella","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
