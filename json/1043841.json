Well, technically I made this film. Also, Grandma Sally is not my grandmother, I have actually never met her in my life, I don’t even know her last name. This film is composed using clips from a RCA Small Wonder camcorder that Sally filmed videos on between 2009 and 2010. I bought the same camcorder at a flea market in 2022 for five dollars, she never cleared the memory card.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ApyLrXSBOjFYkGKOz9lu9ZJOgYU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We wish you were here... but you are here— in spirit!","title":"Small Wonder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
