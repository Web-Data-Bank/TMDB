At 82, Eric is still at work in his studio making books and creating art. As he methodically layers a tissue paper collage of the caterpillar, he describes the feeling he achieves working in his studio, the sense of being at peace, all alone, when everything grows quiet and it is just himself and his work. The film taps into that deep creative need in each of us, a spirit that started in Eric as a very young child and is unceasing today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/thV1I75MplJtjbMlU1vaWtleyBN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eric Carle, Picture Writer: The Art of the Picture Book","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
