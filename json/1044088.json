He sat by the edge of a lake and asked the universe to send him a “story worth telling”. Two month later, he was admitted to Bellevue Hospital, while searching for Ani DiFranco. Was this a vision quest? A mental health issue? Was this all an elaborate art project?  For twenty years Keith Wasserman has made and delivered elaborate art mail packages - all in the hopes of befriending his muse. Dear Ani explores what can happen when you present your truest self, and risk total failure. It is an intimate account of psychotic mania, personal mastery, and creative triumph.","popularity":1.586,"poster_path":"/qEES7HNdZazFWAG5CsfnNjyB6vx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movie Magic Media Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Ani","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
