Two dance ensembles separated by many differences and yet their members speak the same language. The director spent two years with his camera, attending dance rehearsals of the Vienna State Ballet and the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre from Taiwan. He has captured how small gestures, steps and figures create a performance that we will not see in the end and his film shows more than just the final work. We can see a living matter that is being squeezed and shaped into an ideal form under the guidance of a choreographer. Art is like life and life is like art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Be There","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
