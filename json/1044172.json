All were born in Slovakia, but after the country joined the EU, they took the opportunity to work elsewhere in the Schengen zone. During week-long work shifts in Austria, Germany, or on European motorways, they try to get used to their foreign environments while struggling to maintain contact with their children and partners. For their future, they left for better-paying jobs. Now they are losing them by their absence. They don't know what awaits them when they return home. A trio of saddening stories compose a laconic portrait of a globalised labour market that allows people to fulfil their dreams, but often at great sacrifice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zY9Y615CftlaajHuQfGyRElMKCd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shift","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
