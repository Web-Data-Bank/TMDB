Fourteen accused communist functionaries stood before the Supreme Court in Prague. Among them was Otto Šling. The court sentenced eleven to death, forfeiture of property, and loss of honorary civil rights. All defendants waived their right to appeal. Karel Šling is the last direct descendant of all eleven executed. Even at 75, he doesn't give a happy and composed impression. He is still dealing with traumas that he had and could not have had any influence over.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Son of a Public Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
