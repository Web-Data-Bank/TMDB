Bill Haley and His Comets were the leaders of this short-lived musical movement. By 1962 Rock-A-Billy was all but gone. But in present day London the fashions, attitudes, tattoos and music of the Rock-A-Billy era are alive and well; if you know where to find it. In venues like The Tennessee Rock and Roll Club, Teddy Boy society still perpetuates the mores of Rock-A-Billy culture. Visually arresting in its approach, The Teddy Boys of the Edwardian Drape Society offers a glimpse into this little known world of late night London.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o61QUkZJ1PV0EuxofbAoiDHAVJT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Teddy Boys of the Edwardian Drape Society","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
