He was violent as well as kind, beloved as well as feared. This short film highlights these contrasting aspects of his character as he wrestles with his own larger-than-life legacy.  This short film is a proof of concept. We hope to tell the whole story of Porter Rockwell in a coming full-length feature film. We love Porter and his history, and this short film is a tribute to his faith, passion, and determination to do what is right - no matter how hard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8uqtw8KJasEgJmoulZkwf2kibl9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porter Rockwell: Gunman and Saint","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
