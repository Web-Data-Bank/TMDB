A wayside stop for the road weary, the infectious sensuality of the place promises to relieve more than the thirst for water. Beckoned by the siren song of the historic hot-spot, visitors find themselves overtaken by the sultry spirits of this enchanted corner of the desert. It is here that the humble Psychology professor (Tabitha Stevens) loses herself in the hedonistic heat and, through a series of erotic encounters, becomes Queen of the Oasis, luring any who venture near into a steaming cauldron of sun-soaked ecstasy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qlJXIc66Osz9Jj4rZtUfT4ZQel2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Full Moon Features","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Surrender Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Times at the Lost Oasis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
