It maps the architecture of the six bridges that connect Manhattan to the rest of the world by using an artifact to cover the lens of the camera: the colors and flickers of the videos are a result of the interactions of the artifact and direct sunlight being interrupted by the different architectural features of the bridges.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6kUycTkDyAbbnK1DNjvinJcUCsg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crossing Bridges on Sunny Days, Eyes Closed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
