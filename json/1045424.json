Their story has come down to us thanks to the letters exchanged by their social worker, Julie Duval. Louis Clergeau, an artisan photographer, whose pictures are scattered throughout this film, gave them a face and a body. This film bears witness to this little-known part of French immigration and tells the bitter fate of these immigrants in the Touraine countryside, whose story still shakes us today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kTpd1YyfTjsPIN2jTvTIdFKFS2V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76104,"logo_path":"/9aF2Hw6dnKrhmnADmqWUf65wfUC.png","name":"Novanima Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S’il vous plaît madame, répondez-moi !","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
