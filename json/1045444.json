Mouse hopes King will choose her, so she starts to make the cave as cosy as possible, but that just causes a disagreement with the overprotective Dragon. The pair even fight at the Christmas market, and go their separate ways. Mouse hangs out with the foul-mouthed Brother, while an unfortunate spell renders Dragon invisible and inaudible. Which makes a reconciliation difficult, of course.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Can Mouse and Dragon resolve their differences in time for Christmas?","title":"Sir Mouse Christmas Special: Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
