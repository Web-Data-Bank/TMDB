In each scene, the performer has an exchange that begins with the same words—“I didn’t think that I’d see you today.” For a conversation partner, there is only the subtitles, which converse with the performer back and forth.  From the mundane to the erotic, See You Today finds meaning in the process of conversing, rather than in the narrative context that surrounds it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":185487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Strange Trace","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See You Today","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
