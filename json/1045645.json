Egyptian temples, fortresses, pyramids and palaces forever redefined the limits of architectural possibility. They also served as a warning to all of Egypt's enemies-that the world's most advanced civilization could accomplish anything. This two-hour special uses cinematic recreations and cutting-edge CGI to profile the greatest engineering achievements of ancient Egypt, and the pharaohs and architects who were behind them. Includes Djoser's Step Pyramid at Saqqara, Senusret's Nubian Superfortresses, Hatshepsut's Mortuary Temple at Dier el-Bahari, Akhenaten's city at Amarna, and the temples of Ramesses the Great at Abu Simbel.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/uhVpn5eNZ9ScmJ4l3LJYZrtOHUx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Egypt: Engineering an Empire","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
