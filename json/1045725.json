In the slum, children are able to survive today by picking up refuse that others won't, selling vegetables and other things. There are no books, no toys, no study, and no school in their world. There are no dreams.  One day, people came from a place called Korea. These people set up a \"school\" on this abandoned land that no longer cares for its own, and the school is totally out of place. Hope School is where the Korean Principal Lim Man Ho and the Cambodian school children will meet.  This film is the 8th year of their story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aNSrYosKZZcLgms7udbAWfOaN6G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Hopeman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
