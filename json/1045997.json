She is also an actress, an aspiring mountain guide and hopes to be the first in her family to complete secondary school. These are significant ambitions for anyone; in Uganda, they are nearly unheard of for a young girl. If Mbambu becomes a guide in the Rwenzoris - an impressive accomplishment in its own right because the mountains reach to nearly 17,000 feet - she would break all sorts of cultural and societal barriers for women in West Uganda. As this film tells the story of a hopeful Bakonzo girl, it also examines a culture transitioning from harmful poaching practices into more sustainable livelihoods.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mbambu and the Mountains of the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
