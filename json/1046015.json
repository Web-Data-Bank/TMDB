The film deals with the political impact that the Castro regime had on these people, their lives and their culture. It also profiles the community still living there – looking at their fight to maintain closeness to their Jewish roots and practice their Judaism, as well as tracing how they arrived in Cuba. A fascinating and fresh portrait of a little known group in a country fraught with political turmoil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cuba: Beyond the Pearl of the Antilles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
