Even though it quickly takes the form of a diary, the film also mutates into other forms, such as the epistolary, but always through collage, through the superimposition and juxtaposition of figures, colors and lights. Narrated from that melancholy, familiar sense given by the texture of 16mm stock, Lockdown Diaries explores fears, illusion, disillusion and, especially, the great changes in the life of Jeff and his family. From the uncertainty of that March, 2020, including a series of existential crisis and finally reaching a radical change in his life project, the film takes us, through a frenzied, consciously chaotic and, at the same time, intimate montage on one of the many lives affected by these strange times we’re still trying to figure out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pULZqL3PuSYGqBcT19VUmFEtpKg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Felix Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An explosion of gritty 16mm images tells the personal moment by moment journey through the experiences of growth, exile, and fatherhood during a global pandemic.","title":"Lockdown Diaries","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
