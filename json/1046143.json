Posing as \"B\" movie characters, she cast herself as director, producer and protagonist, masquerading as a startling range of female identities. The stylized scenarios of these photographs were the inspiration for the staged talk-show interview format adopted here by MICA-TV, in which Carole Ann Klonarides plays the role of a quasi-talk show host/art dealer handling Sherman's photographs. As they talk, Sherman metamorphoses into the different characters that she assumes for her photos. The cinematic backgrounds are created — as in her photographs — with rear-screen slide projection, a device that conveys the visual and conceptual themes of Sherman's early work. Muzak film scores accompany the transitions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cindy Sherman: An Interview","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
