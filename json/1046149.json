He gives the money away to help an old man, a kindness witnessed by the young woman To (Fong Yim-fun), who is impressed and smitten. Needing to introduce his ‘new wife' to the in-laws, Leung seeks help from his cousin (Tam Sin-hung), whose husband Wong (Poon Yat On) had just bought To as maid, lusting after her. The cousin loans the maid to pose as Leung's wife but the jealous Wong poses as their servant to keep watch, creating hilarious havoc that fails to hinder the love developing between the scholar and the maid.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":185797,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wing Tak Motion Picture Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Follows Fortune","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
