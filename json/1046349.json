This film is a fascinating look at secular, non-affiliated Jews and their connection to Judaism. Many of them grew up in homes that had a Christmas tree as well as Chanukiahs. They often celebrate the rituals and observances of Christian holidays as well as Jewish ones. Are these assimilated Jews a vanishing species, or do they simply have a way of looking at their Judaism through a different lens? Jules Feiffer, father of the filmmaker, offers fascinating observations and comments on his own upbringing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matzo & Mistletoe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
