A continuous relay of projected slides comprises an iconography of Goddess symbols, taboo and sacred, including images of animal attributes. Schneemann reacts spontaneously to the questions; she channels cogent answers triggered by the unpredictable images and finds herself physically activated, turning into a howling wolf or crawling across the projection area, squealing like a pig.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6vgIaAZSfCSYjdvp2aQrLMyjlQx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ask the Goddess","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
