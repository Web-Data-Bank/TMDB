She later invited the evaluation committee outside and asked them to board a rented bus. The bus then made a full three-hundred-sixty-degree turn on top of the flower bed, involving all of the participants in its destruction. The graduating artist thus confronted herself, the thesis committee, and the head of the studio, Michael Bielický, with the question of the relationship between the students and the institution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"360°","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
