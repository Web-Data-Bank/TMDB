She later edited the triptych into a kind of promo video, which highlights her central theme as an artist, namely the sexualization of violence in a political context. The protagonist of the film is Liad, a twenty-six-year-old Jewish citizen of Israel who studies Middle Eastern political science and also makes a living as a dominatrix. Due to her political beliefs and free thinking with regard to sexuality, she often finds herself in conflict with the laws of her own country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
