Labuda’s early work is characterized by an interest in the dynamics of partner relations as well as broader social relations, in the representation of the power relations of domination and subordination but also subversion. Representations of physicality, including nudity, can imply self-acceptance, sincerity, and decisiveness or at other times inadequacy and insecurity, depending on the context.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
