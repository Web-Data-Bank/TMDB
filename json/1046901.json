It charts her life from a troubled adolescence of addiction, armed robbery and prison through her meteoric rise in the music world and early tragic death.  In two years, Judee went from living in a car to a deal with Asylum Records and the cover of Rolling Stone. As told by David Geffen, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and Graham Nash -- along with Judee herself -- the film explores Judee’s unique musical style and the inspiring recent rediscovery of her singular music fostered by Shawn Colvin,  Robin Pecknold of Fleet Foxes, Adrianne Lenker and Buck Meek of Big Thief, and Weyes Blood.","popularity":0.956,"poster_path":"/nY72XuMTsAYVkbZ8Xrs922Yq5Ox.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Angel: The Genius of Judee Sill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
