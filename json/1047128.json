The talented Apolonia was born in an underground theater in Paris and grew up in an artists’ community—the ultimate bohemian existence. In her 20s, she studied at the Beaux-Arts de Paris, one of the most prestigious art academies in Europe. Over the years, Lea Glob kept returning to film the charismatic Apolonia and a special bond developed between the two young women.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/1KQQXwH2q9LTORxfikrU52EWYA9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56475,"logo_path":"/esERw7L1N8H3Fh0WXC0W4zxgDJc.png","name":"Staron Film","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":45230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danish Documentary","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2023-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apolonia, Apolonia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
