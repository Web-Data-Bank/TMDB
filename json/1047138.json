How true are his ideas about his birth country DR Congo, whose national identity was partly molded by the Belgian colonizers? And, by extension, how much does he know about himself? In Colette et Justin, Kassanda travels through time and his own past, in the process bringing postcolonial Congo to evocative life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dvljnZoWTMBgicE4WNqQJ6eryJt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52077,"logo_path":"/u0gxqaV1RJlMmLL7APDzR81bYIT.png","name":"L'Image d'aprés","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colette and Justin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
