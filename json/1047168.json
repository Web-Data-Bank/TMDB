As a teenager, madly in love with cinema, he had lived a unique story with a French woman. Even now, the woman seems to him to belong to a secret world - one made of desire but also of discovery. As much from innocence as curiosity, he explored that world. He also got a bit burned there. He remembers. In fragments. Like a man who wants to understand his past and his present. His life as a high school student, his double life among his adolescent friends, his family, then her. His desire to live life to the fullest in this town heated by the sun and by boredom. The timid and fierce love he had for a beautiful young girl of his age. But above all, his life in the cinema. He is a character; he is also an innocent who believed he could touch the stars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":179548,"logo_path":null,"name":"HAK Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of M","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
