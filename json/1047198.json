Fala que eh nois!\" comes from the English expression Fuck-you, Brazilianizing the vulgar expression to praise the performance of Brazilian surfers and represent the content of the film's images, and Fala que é Nós! it is so that no one forgets who is responsible for this.  To keep the line of always showing what the best athletes of the new Brazilian generation are doing in the water, this year's highlight is the new maneuver executed with perfection by Marcos Sifu, specialist in aerials and show man.  He presents the Kerrupt Flip to the public, a maneuver invented by surfer Josh Kerr and still little explored in the world. Sifu is the first Brazilian to perform the trick and was praised by international surfers, including the creator of the trick: (This was the most perfect Kerrupt flip I've ever seen!).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qKVPGksZLieFBBonHl1m3dx33go.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FoQUE!iu!
