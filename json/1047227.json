Master Pompignac, a lawyer, has the peculiarity of never having succeeded in winning a trial: All his clients are dead, either quartered, impaled or scalded... One day, a young woman comes to him to ask him to defend an innocent girl: Roxane, 11 years old, wrongly accused of having killed a Marshal of France. Pompignac accepts, without realizing that Roxane is not an 11 year old child, but a goat... Because yes, for 150 years, in France, animals, like humans, had the right to a trial in court with a lawyer, a judge and a jury... Caught in the trap, he can't back down, being already the one who never saved a single one of his clients, he doesn't want to become the one who can't even save a goat! This time, he must win, no matter what the means used.","popularity":0.962,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jerico","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":193498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beside Productions","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Les chèvres","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
