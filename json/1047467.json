They were met by Kazuya Tarukawa, a farmer, and his mother, Mitsuyo. Kazuya's father took his own life immediately after the nuclear accident, saying that he may have encouraged his son, who had taken over the farming business, down the wrong path. Kazuya struggles as a farmer and the students who listen to him talk about the reality of crops in Fukushima four years after the disaster and the absurdity of TEPCO's compensation system, as well as his determination to carry on farming on his ancestral land.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vW98WJFkFfEtTMnpJKxZOAzPFrO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inheritance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
