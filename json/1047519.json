The film shows three women who survived abusive relationships—by becoming murderers themselves. Laura from Finland, Rachel from the Netherlands and Rosalba from Italy explain how and, more importantly, why they killed their partners. One speaks eloquently, another haltingly, but all three are candid.","popularity":0.984,"poster_path":"/nMP5XtvQ5rAio498goRn2UCSXzd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Witfilm","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":83867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Periscop Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Look What You Made Me Do","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
