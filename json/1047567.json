Along the route, Antek and his friends line up to warn of the “pink threat” in prayer and edifying hymns. As traditional Catholics, he and his Brotherhood hold deeply conservative views: sex before marriage is out of the question, homosexuality can be cured, abortion is a great evil and Poland is for the Poles. His sister thinks his homophobic ranting is pointless, because in a few years the planet will be destroyed anyway as nobody is doing anything about climate change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5XoGZKBfy8LyQhfIueKFrhMwcKR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87950,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Hand Films","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":189543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Offhand JDG","origin_country":""},{"id":48582,"logo_path":"/tyoN6zoxMJ71GBddxVkk4dpaeze.png","name":"HBO Europe","origin_country":""},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polish Prayers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
