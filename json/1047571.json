They haven’t always been as united as they are now. Husai grew up with her aunt and was the more enterprising of the two—she’s already had some misadventures abroad. When she got pregnant, unmarried, her family was outraged. Now their taciturn father supports their plan to emigrate, but their mother is opposed to the decision. However, the sisters are in no mood to change their minds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e0iMtClctAa0HdV1O1WTxAcIcR1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SL","name":"Sierra Leone"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2022-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Fulah","iso_639_1":"ff","name":"Fulfulde"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sisterhood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
