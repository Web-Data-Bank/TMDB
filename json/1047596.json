Kelly has two sick sessions: a mental session and interview about the fun tropical surf in Tahiti, followed by a session at a California surf spot known for its amazing one-of-a-kind wedge. Slater drops in behind the lip over and over again. He pulls off critical turning on a dime, reminding the world once again why hes still the best surfer in the world.  The Santa Cruz Harbor section, Tom Curren at his own private surfing spot, Kelly Slater at a secret spot in California, Ratboy in Indonesia and Flea surfing Mavericks all shot in 16mm. And dont forget Shawn Barney Barron pulling off the one-of-a-kind maneuver The Barrel Roll. Barney completes a full 360 standing up inside the tube of a wave. A move that has never been done again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cV3VFjdDGH6QryslQxBhRvAknen.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kill Five","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
