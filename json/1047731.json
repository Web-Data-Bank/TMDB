Founded and led by Joseph Shabalala in 1974, they quickly became hugely popular in their native South Africa, but it was their collaboration with Paul Simon on his classic Graceland album in the mideighties that brought them to a worldwide audience. The group's stunning vocal harmonies, combining a number of bass voices with a single tenor and alto and with Shabalala singing lead, are instantly recognizable and extraordinarily powerful and their live shows are also a showcase for athletic Zulu dancing. LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO has played Montreux on three occasions and this program is a combination from all three performances. It features classic tracks such as \"Hello My Baby\", \"King Of Kings\", and the song cowritten with Paul Simon, Homeless, which has become their signature tune.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hMvIX1oWNqlcmhrLWeWUK83pWF7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ladysmith Black Mambazo: Live at Montreux 2000","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
