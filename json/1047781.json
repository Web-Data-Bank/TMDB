But there are no buses running here, the stop is fake, the route was canceled a long time ago, and the stop itself remained here so that elderly people with Alzheimer's from a local nursing home did not go somewhere by accident. They will sit for a while and forget that they wanted to go somewhere. While Asya is waiting for a taxi, an old man appears at the bus stop. An optional conversation ensues between them, which in the most unexpected way will forever change the lives of both.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/szBVkhffjN3EjEI2Gvm6B5NPYW5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buses Don't Run Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
