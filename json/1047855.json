How do such preposterous ideas get started, and why do they flourish? Filmmaker Maxim Pozdorovkin orchestrates bold, striking animation and exceptionally talented voice artists to walk us through almost 250 years of anti-Semitic ideology, focusing on how times of uncertainty give rise to anxieties in marginalized populations, and how three Jewish family dynasties came to bear the brunt of irrational scapegoating.","popularity":0.638,"poster_path":"/5g5QorFenR03bGSXf2ADCh2mCy9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Third Party Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":186463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hirsch/Stern Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":136480,"logo_path":"/5fLrloYGsWbdxS0HMmetiyZJ0Tw.png","name":"Story Syndicate","origin_country":"US"},{"id":186692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illuminated Content","origin_country":""},{"id":186693,"logo_path":"/9FgyMQr7Q80nZq2Lj564tgYthvJ.png","name":"Jewish Story Partners","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Conspiracy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
