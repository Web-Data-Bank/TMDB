I'd like to take you on a surf adventure as I see it through the eye of my camera. First stop California's classic Rincon. I put the camera in my water housing and paddled out with Dwayne DeSoto and Zack Howard. Taking off behind them as planned I was able to capture their surfing experience from a lot of unique angles as we played on the waves together.  This winter the surf was epic on the North Shore and I was lucky enough to be there with my camera. I caught Bonga, Joel, Dino, Kanoa and this years new rookies ripping Pipeline in all it's different moods. Sometimes I got so stoked I had to put away the camera and go out myself. It was great!!  With the swell coming up I called Devon Howard and arranged to meet him and some of the gang at Haliewa. Then I was on to Waimea to film Giant paddle in surf. It was an awesome sight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rSa9sMJ3xpeQHeTjEPZeYtpFcbb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fletcher Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Colours","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
