Sukeroku swears that he will never draw his sword until he finds his family’s treasured blade, Tomokirimaru, so he gets insulted often by Shinzaemon’s men.

When Shinzaemon snatches Agemaki, it is found that he has Tomokirimaru.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":23826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shochiku Kyoto","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1929-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kurotegumi Sukeroku","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
