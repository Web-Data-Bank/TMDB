No matter how well previous type of 'flicker' film is done, they essentially remain machine-like and impersonal. In BOOK, Grauer extends his vision to encompass much more.... The totality of the experience is a kind of wrap-around poem... None of the parts exist by themselves, everything is interwoven to produce a strong and hypnotic unity.\"â€“ Bob Cowan, in Take One","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uBwHoQpqDuxJgeKxRa738NOBvDD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Book of the Year Three Thousand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
