Ironically on Christmas Eve, he realizes that his family has abandoned all sense of brotherly love and liberal values. They are afraid. Afraid of change, afraid that something will be taken away from them. David canâ€™t handle the latent racist talk and shirtfronts his parents. The fact that his father, the very man he has always looked up to, is now spewing right-wing propaganda, shocks him. David cannot simply ignore it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d4rneBykWEeBYSIzxI4QeTzIrFs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Speckmantel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
