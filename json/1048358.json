War does not affect only the soldiers on the field, but the side effects cover vast entities; international organizations, state officials, rescue workers, volunteers. But the smallest denominator of war is often a child. This smallest piece of the puzzle is unable to understand the entire reality of which it is a part of. Their experience consists of short moments, full of unclarity, sadness and often even happiness. The film tries to depict what goes around in the heads of these children, as we follow through the lens a bus full of Ukrainian refugees fleeing towards Finland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8bdAJq0xovHRIjZdfYxA7OKkf8E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of the Border","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
