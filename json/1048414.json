Andrey asks the children to draw pictures of something from back home in Ukraine. What beautiful things can they recall? He offers the example of his own grandfather’s cherry orchard. The children use confrontational, adult vocabulary to describe their experiences of war. A young boy earnestly goes through a number of battle strategies, and a girl provides a vivid account of a rocket attack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r8GE6pfnRU8Wc3NYhEiCUKuGz3R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111463,"logo_path":null,"name":"DocNomads","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Away","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
