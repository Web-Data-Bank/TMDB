The bell of the alarm clock hence becomes a hypnotic trigger. Such an ordinary sound is redefined in our drowsy moments, and we are also liberated from the sounds that condition our lives—queue management systems, electric scooters, air raid drills, and public demonstrations. These sounds are released from the soft soil of our consciousness and grow into a new scene. And we sail with those who cannot be awakened on a boat drifting off course into a new realm projected by frequency.  This is a film you can watch with your eyes closed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z0z70zl1OIgiEi9SUAMMYqHExPz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2022-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(((O)))","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
