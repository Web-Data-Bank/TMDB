Dora was one of the sport's iconic figures. He railed against the commercialization of surfing, yet endorsed one of the best-selling surfboard models of the mid-'60s surf boom; he decried competitive surfing, yet still chose to enter some, and floated schemes to promote others; he shunned publicity, yet managed to use the surf media to create an almost mythic persona for himself. Chasing Dora takes on one of his radical ideas--that the ultimate test of a truly great surfer would be in a contest for the longest wave ridden, on a self-made wooden board, with no equipment or accessories that stemmed from the industrial age--no plastics, no neoprene suits, no surf leashes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/crFVQqoHi5lEc1S2Vb7oZMskAU3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing Dora","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
