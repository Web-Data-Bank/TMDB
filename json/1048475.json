She's done trying now; it's time to laugh.  With her winsome charm and effervescent likability Lexx, who describes her condition as \"post-natal depression but without the ‘natal’ bit\" talks candidly about her mental health - so concerned for the future of the planet she was bringing her hypothetical child into that she became a virtual lock-in.  Expect strength and poignancy, with some killer quips about a certain cosmetic retailer and a gripping tale about a pregnant tropical fish named Mary Berry thrown in for good measure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kOYb94kd64lATGV5RMyHMiVRezd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Up Comedy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laura Lexx: Trying","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
