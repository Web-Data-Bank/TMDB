They answer the phone, peck at their keyboards, organize meetings and take lunch breaks. They learn to type faster, speak better, project self-confidence. With their pay, they buy fancy vacations or giant pythons. What’s going on in this (almost) ordinary company? In this drily funny short, Paul Heintz slowly sows doubts, highlighting the absurdity of corporate work. To what extent can fiction contaminate reality? Without editorializing, the artist reveals the modern working world for the strange carnival ride that it is.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nlaXjsHIVugsHBRlXlC59zsUdjv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Non contractuel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
