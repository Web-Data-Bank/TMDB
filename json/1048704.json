You might've seen this tape before from the Found Footage Festival where they found it at a thrift store in Minnesota, and proceeded to share clips of it online and later screened it at their annual comedy show in 2014. It has then become their most viewed tape to date. The version here is the original 1996 print of the video from Premiere Television, and was later published again by Simitar Entertainment in 1997.  So the wait is finally over; we now have the full uncensored video!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Premiere Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to have Cybersex on the Internet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
