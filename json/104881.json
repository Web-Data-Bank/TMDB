Gruesome and grisly murders are our entry point into the psyche of the Aswang of Quezon City. More a meditation on the workings of a disturbed mind than a detective thriller, it nonetheless shows us a cat and mouse mind game. We watch and squirm in terror as the Pinoy vampire strikes again and again.","popularity":0.872,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vampire of Quezon City","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
