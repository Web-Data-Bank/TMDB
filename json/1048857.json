Soon he has to confront himself with his own repressed sexuality. A homage to “Cruising”, “Blow Up” and “16 mm”, “8 Inches” has an unique approach, since a big part of the video is REAL sex, shot with a hidden camera in several Brazilian porn theaters, where there is more action running among customers than on the silver screen. Another remarkable note is that these theaters are considered straight ones (like all the shows shown there).
