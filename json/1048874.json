Godik sought to bring the American dream to Israel through glamorous, first-rate productions of My Fair Lady, Hello, Dolly!, The King and I and the original smash hit Kazablan, among other musicals. Boasting archival recordings of these sensational productions as well as recent interviews with many Israeli theatre icons, Waiting for Godik offers a nostalgic trip through a time when Israel’s cultural boundaries were just beginning to open to the outside world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waiting for Godik","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
