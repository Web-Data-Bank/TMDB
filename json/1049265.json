With selections deftly mixed and matched for maximum effect, these two concerts allow us to time-travel between key phases of an amazing career, as Reed reinvents classic songs from his Velvets and early solo period and presents adventurous new work — always with the unmistakable droning, dissonance, and literary intelligence that are part and parcel of the Lou Reed approach to rock and roll, and to his adventures in post-classical minimalism and even free jazz, all key to his unique sensibility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qiiQA1GXCbwKEBJthn8N87nrBo7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hudson/Street","origin_country":""},{"id":49252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema One","origin_country":""},{"id":38373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinevu Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lou Reed: Through the Years: New York 1983 - Spain 2004","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
