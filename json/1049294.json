His productions create controversy and excitement around Europe, and here he takes Pushkin’s story of illusion, disaffection and frustrated love, and places the protagonists – world-weary Onegin and naïve, passionate Tatyana – in a triple temporal perspective, referencing the theatrical present, the period of the work’s composition, and the pageant of Russia’s history. Mariss Jansons, renowned for his mastery of Tchaikovsky’s symphonies, conducts this performance from Amsterdam’s Muziektheater.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eqLy18KmGc0CKYz1ukDhizqoM7O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tchaikovsky: Eugene Onegin (Dutch National Opera)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
