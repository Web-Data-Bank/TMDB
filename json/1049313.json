The famous journalist and distinguished poet was downgraded for illegal publications and forbidden anti-Soviet verses. Suspicious locals still prefer to test his loyalties, while children wilingly recite his verses from 'To My Soviet Motherland', written under pressure to prase Uncle Lenin. Eventually, an unforgotten friend shows him a secret wintery path to the Dainava resistance platoon's underground bunker.","popularity":0.725,"poster_path":"/o7q46er7HqA4WkS2wE12tVszyGZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128792,"logo_path":"/eeK03jLoeZCxgD6ML7HYT1u9NJ9.png","name":"A ProPos Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2022-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvi≈≥"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Poet","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
