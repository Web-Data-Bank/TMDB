The video, which serves as a backdrop to a musical piece by electronic music composer Max Cooper, is conceived through the use of simple structures and shapes in continuous “sound” transformation. Geometric elements, which are the visual equivalent of sounds, evolve into an abstract, undefined dimension, creating a colorful “dance” of signs in space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vnjE32e2d69gIZrmZJf6zFmU44J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solace In Structure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
