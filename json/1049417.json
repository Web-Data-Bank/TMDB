He is perhaps best known for his striking photographs in National Geographic, especially the haunting image of a young Afghan refugee in a red shawl. Yet, he says, his previous experiences have no parallel in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, which he witnessed and photographed just hours after arriving home to Manhattan from Asia. In this program, McCurry visits some of New York’s Muslim communities—photographing, among other things, a prayer service at the largest mosque in Brooklyn—to show how the events of 9/11 changed life here forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through These Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
