The key to the work lies in the inversion of the natural relationship of youth-old age, in the paroxysmal and comic-pathetic exorcising of 'passing time' and in the paradox of a reverse 'career' in which, in the name of conventional and deceptive ideals of success and health, the protagonist progressively loses pieces of himself, declines and transforms until the final rhetoric epilogue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1972-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Young Wreck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
