The entry point is personal “secrets” and security, and their place in contemporary society. To examine independence—a limited kind of independence—is to unravel what security means to the identity, a kind of coding of physical history and memory to access all kinds of commerce and services in the virtual world. That key is compressed into these fragments of language (passwords) that are unpackaged through the work. In the video, young actors between the ages of 12 and 16 years stand in front of a red backdrop and read from a sheet of paper, narrating personal confessions, childhood memories, and clichéd rationalities. These are thoughtful, humorous, and emotional stories about a chosen word that often discloses personal information, which is the antithesis of its purpose.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Wij2bw8h5zNPRJXln0dgPpc4JZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Words and Related Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
