The state's counterinsurgency efforts peaked in the late 1970s, when security forces pursued guerrillas into the country's highlands. According to a 1999 report by Guatemala's Commission for Historical Clarification (CEH), a UN-backed body established toward the end of the conflict, more than 200,000 people were killed or disappeared during more than three decades of violence. FA was commissioned by a Guatemalan NGO, the Center for Human Rights Legal Action (CALDH), to support its efforts to gather evidence for the trial of the country's former dictator Efrain Rios Montt, whose brief military regime lasted from March 1982 to August 1983, and senior members of his security apparatus.  Montt would eventually be convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity.","popularity":0.844,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":150573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forensic Architecture","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Genocide in the Ixil Triangle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
