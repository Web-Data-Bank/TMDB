From the hills of Twecu to the cityscapes of Port Elizabeth, we meet characters who helped Mapimpi rise out of poverty and became one of the best rugby players in the world.  Narrated by award-winning sports journalist Sibusiso Mjekeliso, the film provides the viewer a lens into the most honest, intimate and visually dynamic exploration of culture, challenges and the rawness of uninhibited talent in South Africa.  This is a story of hope from a hopeless situation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story of Hope","title":"Map1mp1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
