The film follows escaped mental patient David Ward as he hides in his derelict caravan spending his days hiding from the police and doctors and filming himself raping and murdering while police slowly discover his crimes and get closer to him. The film is told from two view points. The traditional third person camera and David's own Hi8 camcorder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":186504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Straw Line Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":186505,"logo_path":null,"name":"Celebrity Video Distributors","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slaughter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
