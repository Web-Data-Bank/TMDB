Terao, a camera shop clerk, suggests turning it into a narration, so he decides to make a short film to be screened at the next school festival and asks his friend Sasaki, a film fan, to help him develop a script. As he learns that his movie camera has the ability to film backwards, he comes up with a story called \"Time Reverse\", in which aliens attempt to reverse time on Earth in order to redo human evolution. Natsumi, a girl from his classroom, agrees to play the heroine at the last minute, so he can finally start filming it.","popularity":0.644,"poster_path":"/2OMC4rg75WFtWkyoduxImMAyhtt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186522,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bear Brothers","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Single8","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
