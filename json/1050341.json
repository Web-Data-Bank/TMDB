Inspired by their childhood idol Terry Fox, the cousins leave Sept-Îles to reach the place where the famous one-legged runner prematurely ended his Marathon of Hope : Thunder Bay, Ontario. In a sincere attempt to pay tribute to Terry, Richard travels on his bike without ever touching his handlebars, while Clément follows him in his beat-up pick-up truck. The road is long, and sometimes, the best way forward might be backwards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/67clBklXBl8dHmh3D39e51LsiUS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art \u0026 Essai","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FOLLOW THE FOX","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
