The football world is amazed: no football culture, a precarious human rights situation, poor infrastructure, hot desert climate. Who is voting for a World Cup that would endanger the lives of millions of fans and players? Rumors of corruption quickly surfaced. The autocratic state is very rich thanks to its deposits of fossil fuels. Bribes, collusion, contract awards: How far did the small Gulf Emirate go to get the World Cup? The research of the documentary film team leads to the trail of secret financial agreements between the emirate and large international companies, especially from France. The reporters get access to confidential documents, indications of corruption, but also violations of workers' labor rights on the World Cup construction sites. From France to Qatar, from Switzerland to Africa, the dark side of this World Cup will be revealed.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/oy3UXi3oZ8929pnvT1R2VJq3dRx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122245,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV Presse Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Qatar 2022 : un scandale français ?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
