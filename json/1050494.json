The first record of Mosuo culture dates back more than two thousand years. Today, this tribe still retains their unique culture, in which people live with their mothers' families and never marry. Concepts such as 'father', 'husband' and 'wife' have no meaning in Mosuo culture. Men and women may sleep together at night, but during the day they return to their own families. Mosuo culture is one in which men and women live harmoniously, and where there is no difference in status between the genders. Director Chou Wah Shan is a former associate professor at Hong Kong University, whose area of interest is gender and sexuality. He spent more than a year with the Mosuo people, and the result is an intimate portrait of this fascinating tribe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tisese: A Documentary on Three Mosuo Women","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
