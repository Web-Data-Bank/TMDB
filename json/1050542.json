This bittersweet film tells the story of Oscar, a complex character with unique needs but the same hopes and desires as anyone. Rather than a film ‘about’ autism, LOVE invites its audience to consider the world from the viewpoint of an autistic person. We follow Oscar’s journey as he navigates the stresses and strains of daily life, taking the poetic lyrics of his favourite band The Streets, and using them as a coping mechanism when faced with uncomfortable social conundrums.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6YH10FG4ClZAUNZxNfwybp85Wkf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
