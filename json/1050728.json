The images of the film try to update the spirits summoned by a berdache. As an elementary figure, the berdache is close to nature and all its components.

It is in this spirit that I made this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w4vKbHHPNEdHjqOFjLGOQMROsbu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Eyes of the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
