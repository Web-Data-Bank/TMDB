It begins by featuring Mark Abene incarcerated in Schuylkill talking about his views on hacking and the story of MoD. Emmanuel Goldstein is displayed throughout the documentary talking about the hacker community during 2600 meetings and on the Off the Hook radio show. Next 'Hacker Attack' turns to the darker side of hacking when we jump into unmarked NYPD surveillance van to track down cloned cellular phones. There is an extensive coverage of credit card fraud, high tech robbery, and industrial espionage. At last we can watch Winn Schwartau and Dan Farmer talk about threats to our financial and military infrastructures. Throughout the documentary, there are snippets of anonymous hackers breaking into various computer systems.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gjgrUEfSna4UFODYFlznxH42k8P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12476,"logo_path":"/A8X93JHJONB6YXYYRmYWKajp9lg.png","name":"Yorkshire Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hack Attack","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
