Drawing from chimeric figures within creation stories of the British Isles and the diasporic cultures of Chang and her collaborators (Choulay Mech, Jade O'Belle, Anika Ahuja, and Aditya Surya Taruna a.k.a Kasimyn), Chang positions her own hybrid body – part animal, part woman, part alien – as a site of technological interaction and as a locus of ongoing experiment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BXBY","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
