Hollywood stars announce they are “trans” or “non-binary,” and we are ordered to use new pronouns for them. Someone who was a “she” yesterday may be a a “he” - or even a “they” - today. And if we fail to conform to the new regime and instead use yesterday’s pronouns, we may be punished with ostracism; unemployment, or even prosecution.  This new maze of gender identity is confusing to navigate and contrary to reason and revealed truth. On this special program, you will discover the worldview that lies beyond the new gender confusion and find out how it is especially harming children and women. The Tragedy of Gender Confusion exposes how radical ideologues are working to drive a governmental wedge between parents and children, and how the new gender orthodoxy is being exactingly policed in our culture. And you will meet someone who “transitioned” to another gender - but then was transformed by an encounter with Jesus Christ.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/YqsVoxTinnb8I9shCjf1lHp173.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gender confusion’s devastating social impact","title":"The Tragedy of Gender Confusion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
