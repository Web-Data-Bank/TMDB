In order to keep up with the demands of warfare, soldiers and engineers were educated partly with training films. This programme shows footage of the Tiger tanks during Operation Citadel, as well as edited highlights of two German Army training films from late 1943 and mid 1944. Including two major military productions, the first of these films was produced to show how to convert the Panther tank allowing it to successfully deal with the extensive Soviet defences like the ones it encountered at its debut in Kursk.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zHG1siOUbsQQOW5jIZMR6KDA8sv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panzer: Germanys Ultimate War Machine","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
