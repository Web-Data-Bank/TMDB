This project resulted in the 4-part series, The Living Maya. During filming, however, it was impossible to ignore the use of sign language in the village. Smith and his team saw a lot of the deaf residents, filmed them often, and went back to have these sign exchanges translated. Now it is time to share a story solely about them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eG2A2ow8JxeOlY0aKrY0sJXwD6U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yucatec Maya Deaf Sign","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
