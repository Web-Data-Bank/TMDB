The footage is then transferred to 16mm film, presenting the advertised technologies of 1957 (coincidentally, the first year a digital image was ever generated) through simultaneous analog and digital lenses. History is collapsed in a comment on the changing terminologies of lens-based practice.  (The film's title is taken from the title of an essay appearing in the Almanac, authored by its collected editors).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Physics and Metaphysics in Modern Photography","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
