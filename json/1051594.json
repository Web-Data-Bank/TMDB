The 16mm film was salvaged from a mutoscope, a turn-of-the-century device outfitted with an eyepiece in a (sometimes coin-operated) mechanical cabinet that enables a viewer to have a private film-watching experience. The footage, shot in the home, is of a late-1940's woman undressing slowly for the camera (and its operator). Between found film, the perpetual movement of abstract light, the degraded pixelvision image and the particularities of documented 1940's female sexuality, these juxtaposed projections move through a panoply of interpretations surrounding resurrection and decay.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghostmeat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
