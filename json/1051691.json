We had those questions too. So, after graduating college, four of us loaded an RV and embarked on a journey looking for answers. We traveled to all of the lower 48 states, talking to our peers about growing up, 9/11, race, the Internet, careers, sex, love, and the American Dream. Along the way, we met a wide cross-section of young Americans, ranging from a cancer researcher in Boston to a drug dealer in New Mexico, from an Iraq veteran in Florida to the founder of Facebook in Silicon Valley. The film ultimately leads to the recent historic election, where our generation finally stands up to make its voice heard. OUR TIME is a passionate portrayal of a generation, a meditation on coming of age in 21st-century America, and a rallying cry against apathy.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/k6sZfzZJz0YXkG085e2ix5yiEIj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52707,"logo_path":"/7VptgDeYqEZVyFCDL9D9TP28FdR.png","name":"Our Time Projects","origin_country":"US"},{"id":186761,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Young Americans Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Time","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
