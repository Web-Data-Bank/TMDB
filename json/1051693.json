From the freezing nights of a harsh winter to a sweltering summer with its own surprise tornado, she battles predators, terrible luck, and the uncertainty of a future that may not look anything like the one she once imagined. The novel is a darkly funny and startlingly original meditation on life and longing, full of sorrow, joy, and unrelenting hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iwmDvAgheTFyn2D9iXg3hTJMmNc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99366,"logo_path":"/r5UIazzNzEOUSEbxOfwWzEOBe5F.png","name":"Topic Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Brood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
