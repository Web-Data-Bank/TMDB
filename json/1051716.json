Out of all the candidates he picks Daniel, seemingly the least suitable for the job, a young loser immersed in virtual games. Jacob teaches him 'the ancient art' of dog walking; the lessons are a funny, absurd mixture of memory, history, and fantasy. - Manhattan Odyssey is an unusual 'love story' between two men, a woman and a dog, if it is love story at all. It leads us from an everyday activity such as a dog walking to the liminal space of the human animal becoming either animal or human.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xeVkyXgCCxTEmqVvGH5hbqQTumV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2020-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manhattan Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
