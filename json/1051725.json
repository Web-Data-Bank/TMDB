Growing up in San Diego, she spent her childhood among the creatures of the sea - her favorite being rays. The ocean became her place of healing, especially when she realized she was queer. But the more she discovered who she was, the less she saw herself in the career as a queer woman. Years later, she realized that she owed it to herself to become what she couldn't see. She shares her story of taking her first steps in chasing her dreams by getting scuba certified, and along the way, we learn how the lack of LGBTQ+ in marine science can have a devastating impact on aspiring conservationists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fA048ubF5Hv1QcjXZJQJ3oLJzt2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diving for Rays: A Queer Conservationist's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
