Bill's Run: A Political Journey In Rural Kansas captures Bill's journey through the primary, a comical and sometimes painful quest of quixotic proportions, as he takes on the Republican incumbent and fights to preserve a lifestyle quickly disappearing from rural America. A strong supporter was his mother, former U.S. Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, who proved both a rose and a thorn to his campaign. The exciting outcome shows, once again, that every vote counts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill’s Run","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
