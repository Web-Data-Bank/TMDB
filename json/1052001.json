Mendele grew up in a shtetl. Shedding the yoke of tradition and yearning for freedom, he discovers socialist ideas in which he sees as a new messianism. Young Yitskhok lives in the Vilnius ghetto. He rebels against his miserable condition and makes his life a hymn to hope. Shot in striking black-and-white, Oylem is a poetic Yiddish-language journey into the heart of Ashkenazi history and soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oylem","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
