The film uses stop motion, combining textile-based models with natural materials. The ever-changing yet repetitive emotions are explored along the journey where filmic atmosphere and sound shifts mood. The majority of the film features a large handmade set, with other scenes shot on a multi-plane. I made this film in response to the death of a very close friend and I hope my film can provide a sense of comfort to others experiencing similar feelings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3bQiZwAzAtQEhLVGHk57lcu91Pc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edge of Grief","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
