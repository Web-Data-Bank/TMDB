'Wielding the soul' is a trip with LLuís Pasqual and his actors while they rehearse ‘El sueño de la vida’ by Alberto Conejero who, in this text, ended the unfinished play by García Lorca ‘Comedia sin título’. From the reading of the play to the opening, we witnessed how Pasqual helped his actors to embody their characters. ‘Wielding the soul’ is a director’s notebook, a notebook not only to talk about theatre but to see how you can make it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lwS6hviNnBXUERhSsxbpNo80peh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wielding the Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
