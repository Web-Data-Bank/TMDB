The very same Timid Debutante next stars as the Randy Maid in Butler’s Night Out. The production values here are somewhat superior -- there are, in fact, two or three fully furnished rooms employed in the action, and the dialogue actually matches the movement of the lips -- but once again the supreme value lies in the Big Tease, specifically in what the mouths are doing when they’re not forming words.  The Deviate is therefore eternally indebted to the regional censors who indirectly made this movie possible, to the deviate director who cast this nubile deb in this \"roll\" and, of course, to his pal Bucky, The Ultimate Deviate, for unearthing this priceless treasure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Butler's Night Out","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
