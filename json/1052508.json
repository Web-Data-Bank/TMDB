It is the time of year when the sun is most intensely focused on one of the two hemispheres.  The solstices are related to esotericism and for many cultures they have a very important symbolism. For example, for some peoples, the summer solstice is a reason for great joy, because it represents the victory of Light over Darkness.  The solstice occurs twice a year, on June 21st and December 21st, marking the beginning of the seasons, which are opposite in each hemisphere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v7FUZnJFxjUBUrcn0WZuwLZT1bE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solstice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
