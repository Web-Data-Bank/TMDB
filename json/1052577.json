That the politicians in power are playing a game of chess over the Prime Minister's life. Each chess piece represents people who work for the state or leaders in society. If the politicians win the game, the prime minister will live, but every piece lost on the chess boards means the loss of a human life. The politicians and their appointed rescue team, the Delta Squad, are faced with an impossible dilemma: Can they afford to sacrifice human lives in an attempt to save the Prime Minister? With only 24 hours to win the game and save the prime minister, they have no choice but to play the deadly game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6181,"logo_path":"/eaQ7or8IoEmPfgmQiU2C5lVZkxS.png","name":"SF Studios","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":186901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stig Og Stein Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Nation's Gambit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
