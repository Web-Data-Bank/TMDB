Today, with only a handful of deliverymen left in the country, the siphon machines at Gomberg Seltzer Works don't turn like they used to. Most of the old customers have passed on (or moved to Florida). But there are still bubbles being made by third generation seltzer filler Kenny Gomberg. In the short documentary Seltzer Works, the last bottler in Brooklyn fends off the supermarket seltzer take-over and honors this simple drink's place in history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seltzer Works","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
