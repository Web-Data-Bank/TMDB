Tina married an 89-year-old, who just refuses to die so that she can finally get the inheritance. Bettina, on the other hand, tries to keep her spirits up in a rotten marriage where all she does is look after the ungrateful man's children. And almost even worse - no one does video blogging anymore, and after a heated argument, the girls have lost contact with each other. Life sucks. But when Tina goes crazy at the VIXEN awards, and the recording from there goes viral, Tina & Bettina are suddenly on everyone's lips again.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/llJ8ksgRcLNM68iysXK2jXmSDyY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98438,"logo_path":"/cjkuW0QeX3hcUUBkZFFCiYmZvcr.png","name":"74 Entertainment","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2023-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tina & Bettina 2 - The Comeback","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
