Harmonic coastal areas lead to harsh karst landscapes. Snow-covered mountain regions, wild canyons, waterfalls, deep-blue lakes and untouched rivers are perfect conditions for an immensely rich flora and fauna.  Decades of war preserved wide areas of the country from industrial exploitation, so the natural environment is still untouched.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1JRdCHwo9Yt3lXHyQLXOMuDoYJ2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2018-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untamed Albania","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
