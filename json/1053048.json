But that was only the first battle of the young idealists of Generation Maidan. Now they are battling corrupt oligarchs and bureaucrats in the capital and pro Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. From the first days of the protest a team of Ukrainian filmmakers called Babylon'13 volunteered to capture history in the making on their DSLRs. While the smoke and emotions were still smoldering, Director Andrew Tkach interviewed medics, musicians, self-defense volunteers, civic activists and torture victims who appeared in Babylon's rushes. The front-line footage and interviews with young members of Generation Maidan are woven together to tell an unforgettable story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2015-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Generation Maidan: A Year of Revolution & War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
