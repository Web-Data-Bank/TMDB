Too good to be true, and soon, albeit too late, she comes to understand the reason for the bargain. Her close neighbour in the house is mentally ill Valika who terrorises everyone around her. Piussi’s film creates a string of absurd encounters with increasingly menacing effects, but it is – at its core – a fantastically precise film about humanism, its consequences, its possible limits.","popularity":1.353,"poster_path":"/dBZqFwIq2TTLhupafmo3MdXQ8MD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117177,"logo_path":null,"name":"D1film","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":154051,"logo_path":null,"name":"VIRUSfilm","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":117637,"logo_path":null,"name":"R.U.R.","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2023-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unbalanced","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
