But Wulan’s mother does not approve of their relationship. Slamet, who is naïve, energetic, and comes from the village, then meets Donna, a Manado girl who has a free attitude, at a street-side restaurant in Malioboro. Donna is interested in Slamet, causing Slamet to become indecisive. Wulan happens to see Donna and Slamet together, and starts to trail him. Then Donna feels cheated when she sees Slamet’s clothes at Wulan’s house. Later, a misfortune happens to Slamet when he is hit by a motorcycle and is hospitalised. Then Slamet returns to Wulan with Donna’s encouragement. The film is also a commentary about the changing social values in Yogyakarta: such as the intimate acts between Wulan and Slamet in Wulan’s room; the boarding house that has more relaxed rules than usual; and the busy street of Malioboro.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145958,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT.
