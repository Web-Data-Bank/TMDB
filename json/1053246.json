Ambitious and accessible, Lightwork has been on Devin’s mind since he was a teen (and flirted with throughout his career). Melodic and direct, the album was produced by Garth Richardson and offers a sense of optimism and power through as an antidote to the ‘depressing period’ of history we’re all currently experiencing.  Guests on the record include friends and stalwarts from his past (Anneke Van Giersbergen, Ché Aimee Dorval, Morgan Agren, Mike Keneally, Steve Vai, Elektra Women’s Choir) as well as some newer friends and faces (Darby Todd, Diego Tejeida, Nathan Navarro, Federico Paulovich, Jonas Hellborg).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3aXxDoUZ3JPpfRvMqOhRcelt0g4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devin Townsend - Lightwork","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
