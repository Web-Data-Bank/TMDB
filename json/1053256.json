He wants to be a famous singer as seen on television. So he dreams about having a recording session with Hetty Koes Endang (a famous Indonesian singer). He also dreams of meeting the pretty girl, Dra. Ayuningsih. As a result, he falls in love with her. But after being rejected, he finds a shaman who tells him to meditate at the tomb of a virgin who dies on the Friday night of Kliwon (Kliwon is a marker used in Javanese calendar). The attempt fails. The next instruction is to steal 21 pairs of panties and bras. But he is caught by the police and detained. Inside the cell, he is “tortured” by a cell mate who looks like his mother. His mother splashes some water to wake him up and Mirja comes to the conclusion that he should accept himself as he is.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yBbTrWUCqkDo1wbdc6xgM7XPJg8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memble tapi Kece","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
