You may not choose to look for it, but your town has a street called \"pain.\" Every community in America, from big cities to small towns, have streets of pain, streets of violence, drugs, prostitution, abuse and filth. You want to look away' it's your natural reaction because it's just too hard to face. And as a society, that's what we've chosen to do, look away, turn away, ignore it.  But we've turned our backs far too long and we can't ignore it anymore. What were once considered just symptoms of a deteriorating society is now a disease infecting our entire nation. And no neighborhood, not even your is immune.  It's time you took a closer look at the real Street of Pain. Difficult to watch? Yes... it's even inappropriate for younger views. Hard to believe? At times.
