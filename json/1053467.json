In front of old plastic advertising posters on which are drawn in giant format the big icons of luxury and consumerism that make up their shelters, refugee children stand like kings. Symbols of life at the heart of war, fragility, and death, these children are shown by Jocelyne Saab as precious notes of hope in the heart of a dehumanized world. One Dollar a Day was filmed in the Syrian refugee camps of the Bekaa plain, Lebanon in 2015, with text by Etel Adnan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xVtTvguUVCTIN84iud5MQMBzY8h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Dollar a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
