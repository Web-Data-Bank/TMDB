We are the Robots re-imagines the iconic scene in the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), where sci-entists use a synthesizer keyboard to communicate with an alien mothership. In Soda_Jerk’s revision of these events, Kraftwerk play sequences from their own music and the mothership responds with frag-ments of tracks that have sampled Kraftwerk. This jam session– between the original and sampled ver-sions of Kraftwerk’s music–explores the impact of German electronic music on Afrofuturist sonic culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Astro Black: We are the Robots","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
