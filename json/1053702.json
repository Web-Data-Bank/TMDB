She describes her father's involvement in World War II and uncovers a legacy of discrimination and racism against British Columbia's Chinese-Canadian community. Sworn to secrecy for decades, Osborne's father and his war buddies now vividly recall their top-secret missions behind enemy lines in Southeast Asia. Theirs is a tale of young men proudly fighting for a country that had mistreated them. This film does more than reveal an important period in Canadian history. It pays moving tribute to a father's quiet heroism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mSu8qj0amOIfiQSboPUnUE6jG1K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unwanted Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
