In this DVD, not only will you witness the debate, but you will also learn:  How does someone go from being a Jesus lover to a Jesus hater?  How to witness to an intellectual without being intimidated.  How to defend your Christian faith when confronted with atheist arguments.  You do NOT need to know every apologetic argument. You do NOT need to know everything about evolution. You do NOT need to know everything about religious history. But you do need to know how to wield the two weapons that God has provided us. After watching this DVD, you will know how to use this artillery so you can witness to ANYONE. And most important, you will never be responsible for creating another bitter backslider like Dan Barker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pV64jG3mno9cl5ZBbfkK9z02xI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There Isn't One","title":"The Case for Atheism","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
