The work is hazardous, back-breaking and pitifully paid. The camera shows how the boat wreckers work furiously tearing up these hulks under a blazing sun, often with their bare hands â€” a heartbreaking look at exploitation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dala Boatbreakers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
