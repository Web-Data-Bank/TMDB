The film is about different worlds, each of which is characterized by a different state: aimless haste, flow, senseless routine, social masks (both in front of others and in front of oneself), and the connection of the characters there. The film is about the connection of people, about not noticing it, quietly discovering it, rebelling against and trying to escape the unity, reconciling and melting into a single being, a mass. The author of the film wants to believe that in the midst of the pain, wars and brutality that prevails all over the world, there could be something unifying and binding in all of us. Something that, by discovering and becoming more aware of, we could live in greater harmony, without killing each other and destroying our nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Connected","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
