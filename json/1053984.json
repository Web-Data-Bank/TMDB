And so did I.” Na B, a high school student, has a Taemong (precognitive dream about the birth of a child). Na B thinks it was for her elder sister’s baby, but reconfirmed that it was her own by the obstetrics and gynecology. In order to get rid of the baby, Na B and her boyfriend ask around for methods, but for abortion, above all, parental consent is required, as well as abortion cost. Na B came to choose ‘Miffgin’, which is cheap and does not require parental consent. She heads to a place to do direct deal with a Miffgin seller.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2iPguuhEwULZNTkETGz5iwDUM9D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187122,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soongsil University SSFilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falling Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
