Anything can be a calling to everyone. People say that the calling is: PSS! Sleman Regency's beloved club is adored not only by Sleman locals but also by anyone who is enchanted by its calling. Those called by PSS took Brigata Curva Sud (BCS) as their identity. Whenever PSS matches are held, home or away, it is a big day to be celebrated. Fanaticism involves love, and love trumps logic.
