The characters of the film will let you into their lives for a moment, but they don't promise to reckon how their stories will end. In fact, you can be sure they left the endings for themselves. Stuffed stories are a search for the unusual in the ordinary. It is worth absorbing this uniqueness. Remember, the door will only be ajar for a moment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fodnpgILleQdgmEfab7sxYS1HVg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pierogi: Stories with Stuffing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
