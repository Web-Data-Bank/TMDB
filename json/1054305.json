In record time, gender ideology has captured the big institutions: the police, the political parties, the media, the universities and major corporations have taken up the cause in the name of inclusiveness. Gender ideology allows men to identify into the female sex - but is that really harmless? Is it progressive for doctors to modify the bodies of young people in the name of changing their 'gender'? There has been a manufactured confusion around sex and gender. At the same time we are told that 'there is no debate'. Dissenters are cast as 'haters' and cancelled. This is not only a struggle to defend women’s rights - at risk is safeguarding for children and young people, biological reality, reason and even democracy. Reality denial comes at a price.","popularity":0.704,"poster_path":"/nrIu9B4Y2pK5INQ9j6E8JmGRRE6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reality Matters","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary in defence of women's rights.","title":"Adult Human Female","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
