The film follows the couple's research among the materials stored both in the film library and above all in the archive. They tell of a multifaceted and socially committed artist, who has dedicated his life and his work to the primary intent of instilling dream and enchantment into reality, making use of the contribution of all the arts. Through the multiplicity of materials at our disposal - drawings, films, photos, surveys, projects, voices - the film shows the realization of Piero Bottoni's most ambitious project: the construction of a mountain in Milan, Monte Stella, born from the rubble of the Second World War.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aBcGjEujO1U8zlfPmjvLkUmn6sY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Una giornata nell'archivio Piero Bottoni","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
