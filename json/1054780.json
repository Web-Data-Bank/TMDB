Deciding amid increasingly dire warnings about the climate makes it even more paralyzing.  The Climate Baby Dilemma is a documentary charting the growing number of young people either refusing to bring a child into an increasingly unstable world or struggling with the ethics of whether they should or not. As the conversation about intimacy and climate change heats up, we meet activists, journalists, parents and prospective parents, ethicists and scientists to unpack this growing trend.","popularity":1.227,"poster_path":"/vBWUK5pDeUTgq97AV4kPfpbhxjo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109833,"logo_path":"/kZwx5KwbbOx6plPqGlos4ExPhxs.png","name":"90th Parallel","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Climate Baby Dilemma","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
