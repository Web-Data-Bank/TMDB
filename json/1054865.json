As a result, they suffered torture and harassment. Sulata was a contractor who was different and genuinely cared for the tribals. However her employer Sundaram was an extremely greedy man who not only inflicted suffering to the tribals but also longed to marry Sulata. Sulata meets Satinath, a man who would always protect the tribals from any harm and starts liking him. Sundaram does not take this appropriately and one night when Satinath was away, he and another money lender try to kill, Raghu, the tribal leader so that the tribals are thoroughly weakened. His attempt becomes futile when coincidentally Satinath arrives and saves Raghu. Satinath and Sulata together start looking after the interests of the tribal people from then onwards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vfpIRR75vLk8LrK4lUhlBrA6iqs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1983-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madhuban","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
