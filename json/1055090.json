But things are by no means simple. Both have only been in Spain for a short period and are facing a supposedly temporary situation, which must culminate in their futures being defined in the midst of a pandemic. Filmed indoors, Monte Tropic gradually travels towards a more indefinite and dreamlike space to question the memories and desires of these young people, whose inactivity vindicates their right to be above the disastrous political use of their situation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5912olODATXe2rPfyVALstw22H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78523,"logo_path":"/tlptuYlIEOmXlb4PnuJXj6R4H3A.png","name":"Universitat Pompeu Fabra","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monte Tropic, una historia del confinamiento","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
