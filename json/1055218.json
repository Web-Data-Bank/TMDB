In 2005, a hoax news post masquerading as a bonafide BBC news website article, announced a fight had taken place between a lion and an army of 42 fighting dwarfs. The hoax spread like wild fire across the internet before eventually being accepted to be fake. While the articleâ€™s veracity has been diminished, the myth lives on in this outrageous deadpan comedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ycOdkUZYw7Br8ca2D7tpvqaN9N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Greatest Fight Never Seen","title":"Lion vs The Little People","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
