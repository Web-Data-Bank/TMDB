The collapse of the U.S. economy is the result of conscious choices made over thirty five years by a small group: leaders of corporations and their elected allies, and the biggest lobbying interest in Washington, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. To these individuals, the collapse is not a catastrophe, but rather the planned outcome of their long, patient work. For the rest of the country, it is merely the biggest heist in American history.","popularity":1.317,"poster_path":"/4UC6U5was3R02VhRbTwYFtjRD5B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heist: Who Stole the American Dream?","video":false,"vote_average":7.667,"vote_count":6}
