The particular way in which the painter depicts human suffering is presented through a film - a hybrid of real recording and directed material. The grief, the sick body, is reflected in self portraits, portraits of dying strangers and paintings of dead models. The paintings, apart from his work, also express a different version of himself. All together contribute to the depiction of man as a \"garment of pain\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/utBCLVnsa2wcVXdI1pFAq2qBNFD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187378,"logo_path":null,"name":"cinéma expérimental","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painting Pain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
