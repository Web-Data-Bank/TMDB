As people and places in their lives drift away, visual impressions meld with sound and narrative stories to reveal a complex yet moving tableau. As the characters recall their own personal histories, conflicting images reveal their past, present and future. Symbols of corporate America and its not so quiet invasion in our lives are distorted and abstracted into poetic blow ups that correspond to the ever shifting pulsations of the soundtrack. This unique juxtaposition of music, lyrics, images and narrative might rightly be called Opera Verite.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ltvB0hHVNWzLvCZgEwkYgf01xZC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187455,"logo_path":null,"name":"EXITMUSIC Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Funding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
