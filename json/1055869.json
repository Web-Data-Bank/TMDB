The society has almost become insensitive towards these issues because of the sheer frequency and the feeling of a false sense of security that it is not going to happen to them or their dear ones. The story revolves around the key characters- Disha, Tahir, Chandu, Zoya and Salim, etc. Disha is a small town, next-door girl. She is an orphan raised by her grandfather. Her grandfather wants to see her happily married to a good guy before he retires but Disha has plans of her own. She is in love with Tahir and is ready to take any measure for getting married to him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AchxSLUUKMyEQggR9zyQ6Ed0gg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Muqaam (Plot)","title":"Muqaam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
