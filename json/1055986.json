Through Super-8mm film, archival photographs, non-synchronous audio recordings, and poetic voiceover, a near-century-old family pilgrimage is unraveled. It is an evocative, lyrical portrait of a granddaughter and grandfather's shared obsession with the American West, one complicated by Jen's mixed-blood heritage, that traces a quest to find a cultural home while evoking the contradictory landscapes of memory, nostalgia, and imagination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a6PIWpwDHVt6idEq8xjWOo9skuI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Homecoming","title":"Sweet Clover","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
