When Christian sees a vacant weekend on the desert modern house they still own and rent out together, he rushes off to Sin City for a weekend of peace and quiet. As he arrives, Damian is there first, with sexy little actor stud Jason Wolf in tow. Not willing to give an inch, Christian squeezes in for the weekend, and calls a rent-a-man service for a weekend booking. His only request is that the guy be noisy (to get under Damian's thin skin).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zlXDv0zVCiTTPFjitnLCsh7dFtt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140004,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Fever","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desert Modern","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
