He isn't a very social person.  His first alarm of the day goes off to indicate the start of his usual routine. Simple, yet calm. He couldn't complain about it. He gets up to prepare for school, and while brushing his teeth his second alarm goes off. That's the cue for Malcom to get out of the house and head out.  His day goes by exactly as his expected, until suddenly, in the middle of his class at 11:30 AM, his alarm goes off. Or did it? He took his phone out to find no notification. Sooner or later, the ringing starts again, this time, only he can hear it.  How far will it go before he starts to give up his peaceful life?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wFKB1zxnmuahcykbIuDopqL22DB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taknaan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
