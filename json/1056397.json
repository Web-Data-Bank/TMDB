It is a set of vignettes, cinematographic tableaux, built around the repeated gestures of my parents' daily life. I present these scenes sometimes as sequence shots, sometimes as a succession of cut-out shots. Some depict only one parent, with particular emphasis on how he/she negotiates domestic space. With these paintings, imagined in various environments and by a treatment specific to the medium, I work to reveal the singularity of the places, the movement of the figures and the relationship between the two.","popularity":1.237,"poster_path":"/o4UnWiyrt0U3pa41Zb9KZuVKAKO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95412,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Abominable","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
