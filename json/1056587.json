The installation was conceived after a number of preliminary visits to gauge the room atmosphere and d√©cor. Images were chosen and adjusted to reflect various viewing positions within the space as well as the lighting environment in the room. The pictures consist of altered views offering a slightly skewed reflection of the common place. It is hoped that the effect will be one of 'moving paintings'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9CWFqOaA0kMQH9nvkG3uW79P7Vl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187603,"logo_path":null,"name":"Townsend Austin","origin_country":""},{"id":187455,"logo_path":null,"name":"EXITMUSIC Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This album reminds you that there is still hope.","title":"Hemisphere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
