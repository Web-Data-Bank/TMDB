Much of what is left of making art is thrown into the bins - unless it is recognizable as a work of art or too heavy to carry away. The film puts the cleaners Mavis Adu-Gyamfi und Kosmas Gavranidis in the center of attention: it looks over their shoulder at their work and lets them speak.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hardly noticed, cleaning staff at the art academy mop and scrub the corridors and rooms, five days a week.","title":"Mavis and Kosmas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
