This experimental fragment was created because of Rybak’s intimate amateur enthusiasm: it was made without pretensions to public display and commercial exploitation. According to Rybak, without the title and “trailer”, the film was made in cooperation with employees of his company. He also remembered the name of the cartoonist: Miroslav Modic. This is the first preserved film strip with animated drawings made in Zagreb.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1932-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Experimental Fragment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
