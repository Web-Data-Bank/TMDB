The film is propelled by a performer who lip-syncs to melodramatic songs, immersed in otherworldly make-ups and hyperreal images of Korean landscapes. The lyrics adapt wordplay and self-loathing satire with wry humour, reflecting the irony of living in a society built upon the histories of colonialism and the cold war. From a Korean patriotic tune lamenting an ill-fated love for a country to a children’s song set in a sci-fi dystopia, the film composes an anthem of a neocolony.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/762RPkeaywbSLegX0oyJeAu2LQm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viral Lingua","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
