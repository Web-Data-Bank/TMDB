Questioning the fast cycle of cultural production, Choi recycles her exhibition into a context and material for a shapeshifting film in which a group of performers play the spirit medium of the unattended. The resulting film enacts trance like rituals – a dramatic monologue, ghostly rave party and wistful self-affirmation – with an animistic imagination. Colliding references to the horror genre with pop spiritualism, Choi choreographs feelings of disillusionment induced by the pressure to constantly “upload” and “update”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sUP1DUG7HWyc0p2tBrQHSLSSOzO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the Heart Goes_Poetry Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
