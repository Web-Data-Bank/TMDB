With honour at risk, social status bartered and happiness illusive, the Marschallin accepts time cannot be stopped and she must set young love free.  After opening the 2022-23 season in Brussels with Pikovaya Dama, La Monnaie / De Munt now streams Der Rosenkavalier live on OperaVision. The mystery of time resonates throughout Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s highly spiritual and nostalgic libretto, for which Richard Strauss took a step back in time to eighteenth-century Vienna. Waltzing in neoclassical style, with sublime lyricism and a refined orchestral palette, the opera looks back to the past, faded beauty, lost loves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u52H5FRQ93Z6JNiAYzZ2PrK0mdb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Rosenkavalier - La Monnaie / De Munt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
