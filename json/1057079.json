Outside of sports, firefighting is the last profession that demands truly physically fit men. Co-directors Chris Steele and Chad Donovan depict the firefighters' real world and superimpose a gay male fantasy on top of it, one in which all the firemen are muscular studs, well-hung and “on fire” - eager to have hot sex with one another.  As the film begins, we see guys from the Jet Set Township Fire Department - young men in training, working out on a hillside, rolling hoses, jogging down the road, getting both the encouragement and discipline of their superiors. The combination of young recruits and their more seasoned superiors create a realistic atmosphere. Footage from actual fire scenes are interspersed with the new to set the stage for the action to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eK5N0j4I7fEZBOt5XxDhz0AITXJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89553,"logo_path":"/tTLRtdk25NdTyKe3x24Y1CSbs59.png","name":"Jet Set  Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Fire!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
