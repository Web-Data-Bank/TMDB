He doesn't claim to be a mind-reader, instead he describes his craft as a mixture of magic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection and showmanship. Whatever you choose to call it, his unparalleled performances amaze and unsettle all those who watch him. This is a powerful and provocative form of entertainment, unlikely to be imitated for a long while.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ytxbowiVdNQ9hBFccnhmRJuE1of.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Derren Brown: Trick of the Mind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
