The \"Hidden Secrets of Magic\" special is a look into some of the greatest feats in the history of thearical magic. No, you won't learn the secrets, but you will see them performed by today's masters. Charlotte Pendragon escapes, chained inside a locked crate dumped into a bay. \"The Light and Heavy Chest,\" which the great Robert-Houdin used to stop a war, is featured, and yes, it's the very same chest!  But the great jewel is the only video of the famous \"Blue Room,\" in which people visbly vanish and transform as if in a film special effect - only it was what audiences saw live - in the 1860's! This one segment alone, recreated for the L.A. Conference on Magic History in 1996, is worth the price of the DVD.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hUPfBEDuyJUtsA1oeLe2ccBLNRL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lance Burton - The Secrets of Magic","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
