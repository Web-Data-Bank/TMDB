This short film is by far the biggest task I have undertaken and also marks my directorial debut. Something I hope will lead to many more such creations. Around 1 and a half years back I realised that just painting cool concepts was not going to be enough to satisfy my creative ambitions and so I started working on an idea to create my debut short film. This film would draw a lot of inspiration from the ideas I had as a student of architecture. Back then these ideas were still raw and lacked a clear focus and vision but those ideas served as a great starting point for me to develop this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Existence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
