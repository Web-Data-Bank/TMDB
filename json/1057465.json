Because what is it really like to make a living being a comedian and give yourself up - when deep down you are anxious by nature?  In the solo performance \"Det går betre no\" Bjarte shows a new side of himself, and tells personal stories from his outer daily life, and his inner life. As a priest's son with wavering faith in God, the hope is that angels will come to save him when life is at its darkest. Angels with wings, or just with a white coat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aW77xUIPr5BTxGmpTUg6T18DQKe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88033,"logo_path":"/hykhw4mOy3el6JfEkGf4dJu7eVV.png","name":"Feelgood Scene Film og TV","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2022-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Going Better Now","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
