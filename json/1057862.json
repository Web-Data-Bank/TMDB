A suspension of thought.Its inspired by the disappearance of Mariam Makhniashvili who disappeared in Toronto but was found dead two years after.\r It’s about remembrance, the power of a suspended thought. When a loved one disappears or someone vanishes for no reason, no trace, no answer, no closure, our thoughts enter a very specific state of mind. A state that is not clearly defined.

This suspension becomes an Intermission.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intermission","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
