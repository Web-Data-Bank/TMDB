The last information on Lisa is that she's been photographing football stadiums in seven different villages all over Georgia. Her dad Irakli decides to search for her and travels to those places. Levani, Lisa's best friend and an invisible person, sets off to help. As the scenery changes from one football stadium to another, people change and people's stories change.
