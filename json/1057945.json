Narrated by actor-activist Peter Coyote, Aimee Madsen’s documentary takes a close look at Soleri’s origins and lifelong labor of love– the futuristic city of Arcosanti which Soleri sets in the unforgiving desert outside Phoenix, Arizona. Inspiring a near cult-like following rivaled only by the passionate devotees of the architectural giant Frank Lloyd Wright, Soleri’s city continues to grow piece-by-piece long after the death of its creator. Soleri is the most interesting architect you’ve never heard of.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/idjuulHKm5AMdrbVrBf4dek6De7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eye Am Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paolo Soleri: Beyond Form","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
