A thousand rivers are still united by the big waves that bring this dream to life.  THREE children: BUNGA, ARIAN, KEJORA, are brought together at school by their teacher, BU SHEILA, who really understands their dreams and hopes. Unfortunately, wishes are not always what they hope. Arian, whose father is a kuriding artist, doesn't want his son to inherit his skills in playing kuriding. KEJORA, on the other hand, wanted to achieve his dream of becoming a doctor, but was opposed by his father who was traumatized by the doctor at the Puskesmas who was thought to have killed his wife during childbirth. Likewise, BUNGA never once developed her dance talent in front of her all-sufficient parents. Down-syndrome actually made Bunga's parents turn off Bunga's dream of becoming a dancer. A thousand rivers will continue to flow ideals and hopes. The river also makes their dreams come true.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4wzcikglG1b4ClOPT1ThEWnwcAy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Jendela Seribu Sungai","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
