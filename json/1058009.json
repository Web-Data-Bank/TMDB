Asked to write a script about her own experience, she constructs an ‘autobiography’ which is partly fiction. A photographer – who has never touched a camera. A peep-show girl who has never worked in one. A screenwriter who has never written dialogue.  Meanwhile, her unsent letters to her father echo the questions every migrant is asked: ‘Why are you here?’ and ‘When are you going back?’  The film is a critique of certain aspects of British culture & addresses crises of identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vSI74qU03FOcvwdWnRDCsOqRhyR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey of No Return","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
