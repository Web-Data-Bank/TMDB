Tāj al-Saltaneh is central to ‘Gut Feelings: Fragments of Truth’, and her well-documented life provides a window into the lives of other Qajar women. The film asserts the importance of truthful and accessible archival information and examines the part oppressive systems play in spreading misinformation. It asks how fragments of historical truth might reimagine queerness in pre-westernised Iran.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mvivHnKekEV8p3YqmhBtDCJNk5K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gut Feelings: Fragments of Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
