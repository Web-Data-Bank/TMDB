While Joyce Weiland’s iconic Sailboat bobbed freely on pale blue waters, McIntyre’s rusty barge rots trapped in frozen arctic permanence; heavy, unmoving, abandoned. As frozen mechanical flotsam flashes on screen we are left to wonder what, exactly, is being mourned? Perhaps community? A way of life? Our environment? Humanity itself? Barge Dirge challenges notions of legacy and memory by presenting us with only the ugliest remnants of humanity, preserved in a boundless frozen wasteland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2dWU8vCq1HtnnGTWlnlCQlTg27f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barge Dirge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
