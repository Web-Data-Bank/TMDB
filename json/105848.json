He is called in after a bunch of criminals pull off a successful prison break and spend the night picking off various informers and people they don't like. Murri investigates; hooking up with one of the criminal's nieces along the way. He uses his own methods; which mostly involve breaking all the rules, and thus comes under a lot of scrutiny from his superiors who don't take too kindly to the cop's way of working.","popularity":1.133,"poster_path":"/dxXBhwpW3kOdkeHVxCkBZ1We5nw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triomphe Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1976-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fear in the City","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6}
