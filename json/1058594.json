This site allowed her to explore her complex relationship with “the land.” As the daughter of displaced indigenous Palestinians, she attempts to form a proxy bond with the earth, on ground that was stolen from the displaced indigenous Shawnee people.  Closeness to the Land is video footage of hand-painted text signs that translate the word الأرض (ard) into six English words, displayed performatively in multiple locations to capture the now-invisible nature of indigenous culture in Ohio. These signs were installed on the old schoolhouse in early 2021.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mK3eFzhFbUXLwyAc3RuSYco9q6F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Closeness to the Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
