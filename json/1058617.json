Every spare minute goes into finding her missing sister while also helping Roki prepare for an upcoming powwow. At the risk of losing custody to Jax’s grandfather, Frank, the pair hit the road and scour the backcountry to track down Roki’s mother in time for the powwow. What begins as a search gradually turns into a far deeper investigation into the complexities and contradictions of Indigenous women moving through a colonized world and at the mercy of a failed justice system.","popularity":2.791,"poster_path":"/5Gpxz00PLHHukuVysnULVVr5s3l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82857,"logo_path":"/rp8g1y3wVKWfyQ21uWuzxKJ5bQn.png","name":"Confluential Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14638,"logo_path":null,"name":"Significant Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fancy Dance","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
