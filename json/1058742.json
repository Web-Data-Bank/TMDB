From comic book detective stories and westerns to documentary and magic realism, and from hand drawn animation to computer generated images, The Complete Works wrestles Nichol’s writing off the page and projects it on to the screen. It uses bpNichol’s poetic methods on Nichol himself to create a film that is subversive, entertaining and visually arresting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/61C5uJ4zo1IbJYNU5N8lXd7wNo6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Complete Works","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
