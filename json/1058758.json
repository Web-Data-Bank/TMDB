The group was promised a spectacular career, but they were not confident they could make it. Selected based on votes by viewers, each member of JO1 has different experience in performing, including members who had never taken any vocal or dance lessons before. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world not long after the release of their debut single, Protostar, on March 4, 2020, and forced them to restrict their activities. Despite these difficulties, JO1 grew through daily vocal and dance lessons, promotional activities, and program recording. The film closely follows the group from the early stages of their debut to their long-awaited first live concert with an audience, titled 2021 JO1 Live \"Open the Door\", in November 2021.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nnlDBqdvz62Ytj3bUJwtmU5fhvE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"JO1 the Movie: Unfinished - Go to the Top","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
