The various pasts – the 60s, the 80s, the 2000s – comment on each other in a way that sheds light on Bressane’s themes and obsessions, which become increasingly apparent and finally, a whole idea of cinema reveals itself to the curious and patient viewer. Will Bressane, from now on, rework The Long Voyage of the Yellow Bus when he makes another film? Is this his latest beginning? Why not, for the eternally young master maverick seems to embark on a maiden voyage with each and every new film!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8eQxaah7vUX2WSkWWnTovXy4tZE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51105,"logo_path":null,"name":"TB Produções","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2023-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":432,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Long Voyage of the Yellow Bus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
