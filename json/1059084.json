The joys of marriage and family are stressed. Long-term happiness should be the goal, not immediate gratification. A medical officer discusses sexual abstinence, saying that it will not adversely affect a man's virility. A commanding officer points out that sexual promiscuity among troops is not just the concern of the medical officer and the chaplain. He says that self-control should be practiced by everyone. Marriage and family should be the goal of every man. A chaplain speaks of abstinence and self-control as obedience to divine law. Shots include: sailors with their families; a wedding; sailors picking up girls and visiting prostitutes. There is some animation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/keqelCTuy4I0zoMc1f5NM5f4E5g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9381,"logo_path":null,"name":"United States Navy","origin_country":""},{"id":10330,"logo_path":"/nY62adzeba5GVK8LJYD6yd9R8H4.png","name":"Universal International Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"United States Navy Training Film","title":"For Which We Stand: To Be Held In Honor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
