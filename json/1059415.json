Erno Fisch was the only Jew in his town that survived the Holocaust. He escaped deportation by hiding in the forest for six months. From his memories, we find out about everyday life in the area, which later became a part of Romania. Erno Fisch lived in an era when being Jewish did not mean being different, and when he could go to a Catholic school, just because it was closer. His life-story exemplifies the fact that resignation is not the only answer to the challenges of life and history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Free Man – The Life of Ernő Fisch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
