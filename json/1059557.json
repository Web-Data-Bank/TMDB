Jimmy, falling in love with Betty at first sight, makes the Perrys' acquaintance, inadvertently giving the elder Perry a loaded cigar and winning Betty's heart. A porter mistakes Jimmy for a famous mountain climber named Roberts and puts him on a trail with Roberts' gear. Arriving in the Alps, Jimmy is received as the noted climber, and, when the real Roberts appears, he laughingly backs up Jimmy's impersonation. Deathly afraid of heights, Jimmy is forced to climb a mountain, but, with some help from an unfriendly bear, he gets to the top. He lets himself partway down by a rope, which the bear then gnaws in two; Jimmy falls, gathering snow until he is a human snowball, bounding from crag to crag. He is then reunited with Betty, who tries to stop Jimmy's descent and becomes likewise entangled in the snowball.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cVKvh4j4DkrKcFXl1NgJF0TtDc4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Introduce Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
