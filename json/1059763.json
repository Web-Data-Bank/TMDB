The film is an embroidery of thousands of crystals documented in a unique way she discovered utilizing scanners. A once relevant practice in materials science, Ferreira learned the lost art and science of growing painted crystals during my artist residence in the chemistry laboratory of the Kahr Research Group at New York University.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hillocks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
