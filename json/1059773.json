Part one (Sun) was filmed in two continuous takes from opposite coasts on the Pacific Ocean, one near Beijing and one in California. The cameras slowly move laterally as the sun descends and ascends in two skies to create an arc-shaped trajectory. The dual scenes represent longing for what lies beyond.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"when the East of the day meets the West of the night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
