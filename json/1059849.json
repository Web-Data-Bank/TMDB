The MBC show is broadcast once a week in 23 Arab countries, and has some of the highest viewing ratings in the Arab world. Heated discussions on topics such as marriage with foreigners, homosexuality and sex before marriage are interspersed with politics and entertainment.  The presenters are independent, articulate women, who have become part of the family in many Arab living rooms. In 2007, we featured this controversial talk show, putting women's rights on the public agenda in the documentary film Satellite Queens. Ten years later, only one of the team of four presenters we filmed ten years ago has remained: Muna Abu Sulayman, who has been the celebrated Saudi co-host of the show for 15 years. New to the show is actress and presenter Nadia Ahmad, a flamboyant media personality from Kuwait.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6RQ0FPwrQyCt2KaXLdKMZC95XO7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to the Satellite Queens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
