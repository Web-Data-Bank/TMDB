GAI Studios brings us its newest release, DOWN TO EARTH, which completes its line of the 4 elements-themed videos. The most ambitious project to date with a cast of 20 has a story line and a DVD special that makes us gasp for air even though we are down to earth. Once again, GAI Studios delivers us some brand new beautiful faces never seen before, with half the cast being new, and superstar Billy Brandt after a 2-year hiatus with a roaring comeback, literally!?
