Cats have their own unique and indescribable bond with people – even when living independently as community cats. For far too long, felines have been the “invisible” part of the human-animal bond and it’s time to shine the spotlight on these magnificent creatures and the humans devoted to them. A portion of every ticket at every destination goes to a local animal welfare non-profit, bringing community awareness and support for the needs of local kitties.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dA7XPBblgQVLMgn2A4t3gKwOhpP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Collection of Short Films Exploring the Mystique of the Fascinating Felines Who Share Our Lives.","title":"2022–2023 New York Cat Film Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
