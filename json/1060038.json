Kids fell asleep reading the Lionel catalog and dreaming about what engine, freight car, or new accessory they would get for Christmas. Memories of those happy times have lasted. And that's what this video is about - toy train Christmas memories.\r It's also about Christmas layouts that capture the marvelous time when we were young, and it was Christmastime - snow falling, sparkling street lamps, red ribbons, gaily wrapped presents, and colorful holiday lights.  All aboard for a joyous Christmas ride to a magical land filled with toy trains, tiny lights, one-horse open sleighs, and a wonder of Christmas. Featured are three dazzling Christmas layouts, Dept. 56 Villages, Lionel, LGB, and MTH trains, and the original music of Jim Coffey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vi9RvdjXKFmaTTNxwag60J8Cpfs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toy Train Christmas Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
