It explores Aileen Hunt's life, her illness and working life and the effects that her MS has on her, her family and particularly her husband Simon. It shows their journey together to Mexico to get treatment which will hopefully halt the progression of this illness in it's current state. Raising awareness of this disease and its treatment is a fundamental goal which I wish to achieve with this documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v4ZyoFqGbyAhInkVx7mEzfnwAv1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188194,"logo_path":"/pQJd8O15nrFgLjDYEjfCut443ll.png","name":"Black Thistle Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MS, Mexico & Me: Aileen's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
