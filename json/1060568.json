Her rags-to-riches story is one you can't make up: from homeless at 15 to a millionaire philanthropist; from getting thrown into psych wards to throwin' herself into the Texas gubernatorial race... she's led one helluva life. Call her crazy, but under the larger-than-life exterior, this Texas tornado is a woman with resilience, fierce intelligence, and an enduring love for Momma.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/seo6qxqqeXEryaMVVsscqWqopwa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Graybeard Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"\"Way out yonder, on a splinter of land jutting into the bay, there lives a Baroness...\"","title":"The Baroness from Kaufman County","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
