The investigations were spurred on by a number of articles that blamed comics for the rise in juvenile delinquency in post-war America. Chief among  the critics was Doctor Frederic Wertham, whose book, \"Seduction of The Innocent\" has been blamed for nearly single-handedly crippling the entire comics industry.  \"Confidential File\" was aired in 1955, after the senate hearings and the formation of the Comics Code, but it serves as a perfect example of how the media reacted to the comic book industry, and sought a scape goat by blaming the comic book publications for society's own lack of responsibility in raising its children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s0cPqdyGTBNQoqu5SwxkdwpKUuP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188197,"logo_path":null,"name":"KTTV Los Angeles","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Seduction Of The Innocent","title":"Confidential File: Horror Comics","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
