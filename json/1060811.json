Using only behind the scenes and B-roll footage altered with animations, it is a painting of the emotional experience behind and in front of the camera. It is as much about the content as it is about the making of it.  The project revolves around a series of music videos created to original tracks but the end results are neither seen nor heard; what remains visible, however, are the sensations of the contributors during the production. It is a journey that cramps with discomfort at the beginning but opens up, softens and releases into something tender and compassionate. The result is relentless and unforgiving but it is an ode to the loving images we create of ourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"a.o.k.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
