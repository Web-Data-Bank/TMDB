Charles is the self-elected and much beloved leader of the Orange Nation, but when his rude punk rock nephews visit him and cast a \"citanic\" spell on his mind, things go horribly awry. Demons control Sunkyst's brain, using his power as leader to do evil things. Wars erupt, mentally challenged oranges are ground up into food, and strip clubs are visited! The people's ultimate devotion to the beloved leader is tested, but a rebellion soon follows. Now only Professor Sunkyst's old friend Eggbert (a plastic alien egg) and a group of idealistic college students can save him from destruction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pPr2HfEARwaa1N9LRgIhqxrqzZb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104697,"logo_path":null,"name":"GMP Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":110668,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rounds Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oranges: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
