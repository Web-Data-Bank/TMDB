Margie has been collecting salt and pepper shakers for 73 years -- at 94, her days are spent repeating the same, simple routine. When her granddaughter pays her a visit, the collection, now in the thousands, takes on a new life. With a score by Dan Deacon, the film -- part love letter, part documentary, part experiment -- merges the real, the fantastical, and the world of a computer desktop.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e7rWNz5bM1bzIBvx9Vn4hxGxlMD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margie Soudek's Salt and Pepper Shakers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
