This includes a conversation with a Kurdish mother named Ayşe, who requested asylum in Cyprus in 2007. Speaking in Turkish Cypriot with Xenofontos—who responds in a Greek Cypriot—Ayşe is depicted swiping through images of her new home in Ankara, Turkey, where she has since relocated. The second portion of the film follows Ayşe in her space of work, where she is a cleaner in a local school, and in her living room, where Xenofontos interviews her in front of her wall of images of Abdullah Öcalan—a once prominent yet controversial leftist political figure. Through these vistas, Sunlight Vandalism reflects on the labor of domesticity and the precarity of settling during politically motivated migration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kFpha0w4IVzKWr0VhI8PouLJ2g4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunlight Vandalism","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
