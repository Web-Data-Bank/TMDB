Meanwhile, sluggish, eerie electronic beats often accompany angled shots of apartment interiors, accentuating a certain ghostly nature of such spaces. Music haunts, yet this state of being haunted has nothing to do with horror; it is more hypnagogic and ethereal. Amidst the hauntingly disorienting music, the sense of space is as distracting as the temporal experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jkrpRbmdpfW7qZlH0QkhM5Ky8q8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Half Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
