These 855 women joined the war effort with little knowledge of what exactly they would be doing, but were quickly given the mission of a lifetime: sort through and fix the three-year backlog of undelivered mail. A herculean task, that most thought to be impossible, the women not only succeeded but did it in half the time they were given. Facing discrimination, unfamiliar land, and a war-torn country, they persevered and sorted over 17 million pieces of mail, reconnecting American soldiers with their families and loved ones back home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3096,"logo_path":"/fkZTZ4veYYr3lwr2riVrVAOfeqD.png","name":"Tyler Perry Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":551,"logo_path":"/jSlzEZZ4Z1g7B2UExjZEIKsUvD9.png","name":"Mandalay Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":188436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Her Excellency Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":188437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intuition Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Six Triple Eight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
