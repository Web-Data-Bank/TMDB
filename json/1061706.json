When Obasan dies and a distant uncle pops up to take them back to Tokyo, Otani convinces his sister to run away. They must go and lay their grandmother’s ashes at the family altar located in Tomioka, in the heart of the forbidden zone. Otani, reserved child who only communicates with Yokai, and Akiko, the little beauty blogger, embarks on an initiatory journey. Pursued by a taciturn policeman, passionate about butterflies & their hurried uncle, the children rediscover the strange province of Fukushima where nature gradually takes back its rights. Assisted by an eccentric old man who chose to help the animals in distress, the brother and sister are confronted with a brand new Yokai born of radioactivity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2WWTqqFOAE4Eo0IOSarB57GQabS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21562,"logo_path":"/yMpOxI9b1N91ZLBDkplMNxF5g6M.png","name":"Foliascope","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Back to Tomioka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
