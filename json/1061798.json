One day, he realises he’s been infected with Heterosis, a strange virus decimating the community and turning gay men into… heterosexuals! Jim loses his throne and is abandoned by his entire entourage. All but one follower: Lucien, a scrawny young virgin. Together, they set off on a journey across the Marais (the parisian gay village), in search of the mysterious Doctor Ragoult, who claims to have found a cure for the virus. This cure could not only save Jim, but also prevent the extinction of homosexuality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cEQCVRjP1VJ1oWGwVK6i91SA87A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107583,"logo_path":"/14asAv6f73J1V4smKEC6aiG8ihI.png","name":"Bobbypills","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Jim Queen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
