Monsieur Hulot’s Christmas tree is dying. He decides to save it and plant it right in the middle of the rotary, the only remaining plot of land in this urban environment. Hulot is helped by his little neighbor, Louis, a great fan of his whimsy and eccentricities – much to the discontent of his father, who happens to be the borough mayor. But the tree grows so tall that it creates a joyful chaos! So much so that by the following Christmas, the mayor decides to get rid of it, and thereby end the bond his son shares with Hulot. The decision is made to chop the tree down! But instead, with the help of Louis, Hulot, a bit of snow, a little touch of magic and a lot of love, life turns into a “jour de fête”, a never-ending celebration!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2pr4KAkHmZA6048qvEgIk0pOIJj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188473,"logo_path":null,"name":"TNZPV Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Merry Christmas Monsieur Hulot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
