Singing gracefully and joyfully, her little colleagues lay the drops of dew that feed the trees they have to preserve, but Pwet just canâ€™t seem to do it. Worse, the single, stunted leaf she finally manages to germinate flies away in a gust of wind. This is the beginning of a long journey for Pwet, in search of her precious shoot. A wondrous adventure in the company of Tut Tut, an eccentric dandelion Mellow, with whom she finds friendship, a whole new world... and herself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9hWWpz2o64HmKLbrDnXffMdgkil.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94452,"logo_path":null,"name":"SUPAMONKS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Mellows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
