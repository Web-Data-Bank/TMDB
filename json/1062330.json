The time that an idea takes to be born in our mind. The time that a fleeting hallucination lasts. This hallucination is that of Neanderthal man who thinks he sees, at the moment his mate was giving birth, a baby from the modern world, erasing for a fleeting second the slow evolution of the species.

The father tries to get in touch with his son, reincarnated as a 40-year old man, an ordinary man... or almost.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ADN","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
