His iconic images, set in unexceptional places, reveal the poetry of quiet, private moments. Hopper’s influences, which vary from French impressionism to the gangster films of the 1930s, are explored through archival photos, footage of locations he painted in New York and along the New England coast, and interviews with artists Eric Fischl and Red Grooms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tLI9bQinckFk2wrYxlCP2DWL188.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Department of Exhibition Programs, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, USA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edward Hopper","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
