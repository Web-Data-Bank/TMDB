While the frost and drought punish the land, they learn to understand death, illness and love with each act, word and silence of their parents. A story about the echo of what clings to the soul, about the certainty of shelter provided by those around us, about rebellion and vertigo in the face of life. About growing up.","popularity":1.502,"poster_path":"/lFkRkV5suyV27XAL6GDcFNQ4Rj1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188588,"logo_path":"/oJxBI9n4Cbs1ZRMJghW275lKhXk.png","name":"Radiola Films","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":126532,"logo_path":"/1QltQXWd4xdg9UHGTTKpXzcQmer.png","name":"Chulada Films","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":7306,"logo_path":"/iqCkzLmACmrws2tHO2USRLkJqXY.png","name":"The Match Factory","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2023-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Echo","video":false,"vote_average":6.167,"vote_count":3}
