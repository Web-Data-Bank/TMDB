It begins with an ascent of Mount Carmel upon which the Druze towns of Dalyet el Carmel and Isfiya are located, drawing the viewer into a world of geographic isolation and a locale shaped by coercion and control. Living mostly in mountainous areas in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Palestine/Israel, as well as in diaspora globally, the Druze maintain close-knit social and religious ties as a minority within and across national borders.","popularity":1.248,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We No Longer Prefer Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
