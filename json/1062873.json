Nor do they consider the lightness and calmness that can come when the race seems not so crucial. I LIKE IT HERE is about all those things and, finally, about the pleasures of being alive. A figurehead of American independent documentary film, Ralph Arlyck conveys how it feels to look back on your own life, to contemplate your place in an ever-changing world, and what to make of the time that remains.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/plFVuGbvEnH9DFf5Ay3tBra4lTN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Like It Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
