Desperate to get an abortion in a country where doing so could land her in jail and unable to fund one illegally, her situation shakes her world. But thankfully, she doesn’t face it alone by virtue of her best friend and sidekick, Gabriela. In her directorial debut, Hyland skilfully captures the incongruity of the inseparable duo’s lives as they move between their fuzzy pink apartment and the rough and raw backstreets of Santiago.","popularity":0.685,"poster_path":"/ovNbDFoMPtCJHP86ud9fHBbhQkW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maltrato Films","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":113464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Niña Niño Films","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2023-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outsider Girls","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
