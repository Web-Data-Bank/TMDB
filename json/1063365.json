ART. NOW. This short was self-filmed during the Los Angeles COVID-19 shutdown. When Josh, a YouTuber, unexpectedly receives a package, it starts him on a journey of wit, brilliance, and over the top, determination. What started as a lens review, quickly morphs into a story on it's own, thrusting our protagonist into a world of sci-fi fantasy and neo-noir.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iY7WmLpPBkZkwmdJ87fuNWMamQ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188735,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAKE.
