So, the more of us, the less everyone gets, right?  Thomas Robert Malthus was the most popular theorist behind this thinking, which follows a lineage that can be traced through the many horrible sets of logic that have been behind many of humanity's most heinous deeds.  So was he correct? Well, no. History has proven him wrong again and again. With Less Sucks, Peter Coffin traces that lineage to today's \"degrowth\" movement, shutting down Malthusianism once and for all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mCYgHmcRuYYKrV7QTtPV6sKF0Lc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is humanity the virus... or the cure?","title":"LESS SUCKS: Overpopulation, Eugenics, and Degrowth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
