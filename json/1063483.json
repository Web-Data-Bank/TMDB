Casting an archival gaze on San Francisco and cities, towns and places throughout California where nature and culture meet, the film recalls moments in the history of our state's resources, the scars of settlement and its backbones: transportation, extraction, communication, travel and labor — all intersecting in a panoramic city/state symphony documenting the past and suggesting possible futures in an age of systemic uncertainty. This year's film (the 17th!) combines home movies, government-produced and industrial films, feature-film outtakes and many other surprises (including many newly discovered San Francisco historical images).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Landscapes 2022: Past Glimpses and Possible Futures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
