Should it be the purest of colors--therefore, white? Or does everyone have their own color that signifies 'Love'? Is saying 'I Love You' merely three words often said without consideration, or is it a promise of commitment by which one should abide? A blizzard and a box of gifts change Dong's life. Safeguarding him with compassion is the person that he has grown up with, and the person he longs for, but every time their paths cross, the outcome is never the one for which they yearn. What does destiny hold for them?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dong lian wang xin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
