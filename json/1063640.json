It follows the story of a man who wakes up in an apparently abandoned hospital then walks out into the night in search of answers.  As our hero wanders the mysteriously empty streets he encounters a series of characters who emerge from the shadows like the lost and the damned. These moonstruck individuals all seem to share a connection - a connection that might lead him to the truth he seeks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zGA8MNPYpkOZ56mhiCxcdVfFHFq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"33X Around the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
