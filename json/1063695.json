Ahmad is an idealistic teacher in exile, educating the local community; his partner Niloofar, however, has spent time in jail in Tehran for the very same offence against the State. The disaccord between them is not only social but also personal. Ahmad's destiny collides with that of a family fleeing the Taliban; soon the intricate divisions of age and gender within that group will trigger other problems and entanglements – including a 'lovers on the run' intrigue that fleetingly recalls Murnau's classic Tabu (1931).","popularity":0.61,"poster_path":"/1p7nRav2sqqGU9Ps99T58YSFCE4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113817,"logo_path":"/pJDTmaw7YYAV5tqTz5lemul1bev.png","name":"Europe Media Nest","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":127560,"logo_path":"/sAiksVNodBJAC0wEw9IE6lUBmB5.png","name":"Filminiran","origin_country":"IR"},{"id":199689,"logo_path":"/is1x0n4yP4zjkqnfKrOE2Ov98jH.png","name":"PakFilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2023-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endless Borders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
