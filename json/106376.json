Karl, an old age pensioner, is busy chasing after an amnesic old screen legend. Julia, Karl's granddaughter, is torn between a mediocre bank manager and a wild sailor, and tells them both she is pregnant. But is she really? Steingerdur, Julia's mother, has a wild crush on a preacher who has a serious drinking problem, and ends up with a dead stripper in his Jacuzzi. The characters cross each other as the film progresses, until the three interwoven strands of the story finally come together in an explosive and hilarious crescendo full of surprises.","popularity":1.057,"poster_path":"/wEzS12VJdrsuFZcglq2eOTmnKWP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Íslenska kvikmyndasamsteypan","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":14938,"logo_path":"/qbTj5eKcWTz3G9SU6LKImzAsne2.png","name":"Zik Zak Filmworks","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":4589,"logo_path":"/KSdQ5qXyrYio755x6beTmzRiUu.png","name":"Tradewind Pictures","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":76,"logo_path":"/nebkQYtQKhZyHJfh5v0oGpNbPzu.png","name":"Zentropa Entertainments","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":14939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhein-Film","origin_country":""},{"id":315,"logo_path":"/hdu0sVxgtCuQud0xF8ZBiN7hEhY.png","name":"Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2000-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fiasco","video":false,"vote_average":3.3,"vote_count":6}
