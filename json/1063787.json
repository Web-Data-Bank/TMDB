Irmak Akgur directs \"Limerence,\" a slice-of-life portrait that flows in uninhibited vignettes. Minimally plotted but tonally sharp, Akgur's film captures a couple of free spirits in their element - spending the day preening, dancing in the sun, making love. Built with convincing intimacy and naturalism, it culminates in a moment of carnal revelation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/644gYvjtgNdpIELMCZZLUMJp62B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14872,"logo_path":"/udD9q0nbMXvneV4lpqYcOR7om74.png","name":"Tisch School of the Arts (NYU)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Limerence","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
