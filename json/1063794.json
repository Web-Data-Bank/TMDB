Most kids films aren't great; content, story or cinematically speaking. Poorly made fluff, focusing on lowest common denominator humour, simple plotting, needless Celebrity voiceovers and an over use of meaningless slo-mo. What makes it worse is that a good portion are based on nostalgic IP's, your Smurfs, Scooby Doos, or Garfields. So not only are they poor quality films, they're trashing your childhood.  Most reviews for these films have the disclaimer: 'harmless fun for the kids, tedious for adults'. And on the face of it, who cares? They are children, underdeveloped minds who won't realise that these films are woefully sub-par. But why not push the genre, make something that looks decent, has some depth, is actually in love with the medium of cinema. Why not create a child classic? Enter 2014's Paddington.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paddington: Baby's First Wes Anderson Film","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
