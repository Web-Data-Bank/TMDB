What you are about to see has been selected to break down and make you gag on your own vomit. Take all the scenes form the original movie that are morally wrong and upset your stomach, and be prepared to have that uncomfortable feeling doubled. I would never have made a sequel to the most disturbing movie, if I didn't think it would be more extreme than the original film. My goal is to bring disgust, anger and hatred to everyone in this fucking world and by not hitting the 'stop' button, you have entered my path of mental destruction.","popularity":1.165,"poster_path":"/8eCzBzmpyVTqlkrGCq4RyfjkTFM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The following movie was made during several nights of excessive drug use.","title":"Most Disturbed Person On Planet Earth 2","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
