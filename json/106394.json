Their tale is told and dimly comprehended by the unnamed narrator, a boyhood friend whom Roderick has summoned. When Madeline soon dies—or seems to die—they entomb her body. On a stormy night, \"cracking and ripping\" sounds and a \"shriek\" from below convince the panicky Roderick that \"We have put her living into the tomb!\" The shrouded, emaciated figure of Madeline appears at the door of Roderick's book-strewn study, falls upon him, \"and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse.\"","popularity":2.441,"poster_path":"/tAQ85wZW4peogUJha88rT8SPq7v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fall of the House of Usher","video":false,"vote_average":7.013,"vote_count":39}
