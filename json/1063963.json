Through preaching, writing and publishing their own books, business start-ups, by hiring both the mentally and physically ill, and exalting the women as both preachers and business leaders. Hauge stood in the breeze for a Norway that did not fall into good soil with the State, which in turn brought life to the Convict Poster to prevent Hauge from spreading the message of equality for all. The price was high, but Hauge and his successors left indelible traces in modern Norway.","popularity":1.056,"poster_path":"/2VfHsGeh2Y8sHu5v7hfIN8qteQb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hans Media","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2023-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hans Nielsen Hauge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
