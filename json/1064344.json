The setup: one camera, three settings and three encounters with at least one parent, discussing something so essential, it can hardly be put into words: at times brutally honest, at times lost for words, their encounter will show the difference in each child -parent experience as well as its impact on the individual.  The artificial setting is opening up room for dialogues on family trauma, the fear of growing apart and the moral certainty that death will inevitably end the relationship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daughters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
