All hands are on you? Lips, spit, tongues, sweat, semen?  In the second entry of HardWerk’s stripped-down-and-teased-out “Ask Me” docu-series, the camera is turned on Delfine Dahlia for a candid exploration of desire, sex and self.  Through on-street interviews and breathless gang bang footage, it asks the question, “Where do you find freedom?” Is it in the wide-open spaces of Berlin’s Tempelhofer Feld or is it surrounded by a circle of waiting dicks behind the steel bars of a cage?  For the filmmakers, the format provides an opportunity to put their full focus on the fucking, to create a production and take part in it at the same time, and to capture that ecstatic moment when fantasy becomes fact.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kN8JpeoRdorGqybxDRydfczUZB7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162447,"logo_path":null,"name":"HardWerk Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Curious.
