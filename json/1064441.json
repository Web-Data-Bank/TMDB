With a mixture of fictional and documentary techniques, the film immerses us in the universe of sidecar racing, paying attention to the peculiarities of a vehicle driven by a magical alliance between pilot and passenger (or as it is known in sidecar jargon, 'monkey'). Aided by a dreamy musical score and Hélène Louvart’s deft cinematography, Love & Crashes explores technique and sensuality, control and spontaneity, the physical and the mental, speed and care.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1nmEOC47EHhgu5R7QMfyo2O4dXq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love & Crashes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
