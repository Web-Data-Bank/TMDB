Blending street interviews, YouTube video clips and recordings of cadre meetings, the film explores BJP's multi-pronged efforts not just in social media outreach, but also in getting people to voting booths on election day. The persona of Narendra Modi, of the BJP, becomes the hook throughout the campaign, side-lining even the party's local candidate. Infrastructural issues plaguing the constituency are deflected with appeals to India's glowing international image and dissolved in a cult of personality. Avijit Mukul Kishore's film, in contrast, is resolutely local. With dispassionate curiosity, it documents the mechanics of a cog in what is called 'India's Greatest Election Machine'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4pXa64YCKpEsFdnBwf9MFZoSSdk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Election Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
