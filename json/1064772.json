This new part of the Filmed Diaries is spread over only six months (from 1 January 1992 to 30 June 1992). In response to this agitation, The Land of the Living is nothing but calm and contemplation. These are slow journeys on Swiss soil (Geneva, Lausanne, La Chaux de Fonds, Bienne), in the Morvan, the Bugey, Cherbourg, the Southern Alps. And Paris seen from its very bowels: by slow boat travels on the Seine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x0TeSXz4B1Xde8DIbGoDwHNuUrY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Terre des Vivants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
