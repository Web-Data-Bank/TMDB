We all looked for something, or someone to hold on to. The ground was shaky and no anchors were in sight. I called a few people I knew to make sense of this sorrow. I found Mr. Owens and Beloved, who lived in Harlem. These two were walking with the wounded. They helped me make sense of this rattling by opening their hearts and showing me a world of possibility, of transformation and maybe a rebirth. As the spring approaches, I wonder what we have learned from these days? How wide can a heart be opened, and can it protect us from what comes next? Have we found light within? This film is a meditation on the people who heard that deep call of sorrow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elegy: My Two Months in Harlem","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
