But that doesn't mean the Yuletide can't be celebrated. Recorded in beautiful country Victoria, Australia, at the tail end of a legendary lockdown, live in front of dozens of people - oh, alright, a dozen - this is A Swingin' Bella Christmas, 2020.  If you've never been to A Swingin' Bella Christmas, season's greetings! Lovely to make your acquaintance! You'll pick it up as you go: the first set is largely Christmas originals, the second set is largely carols. There's some very occasional coarse language, sorry about that.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/siPlfreYaj2is2UKHe67jWFNT0d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Swingin' Bella Christmas 2020","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
