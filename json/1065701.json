After his forced conversion to Pentecostalism, he is compelled to stop all his ritual activity and oratory. Concerned by the disappearance of “those who know”, a young Catholic priest named Yans Sulo sets out in search of the society’s ancient oral genres, seeking to invent new forms that would keep them alive. The two men meet. But it is too late. By recounting the life and death of Lumbaa, the film shows how the intrusion of world religion disrupts a Southeast Asian society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cjMKBiN1bzI5LzZCTcCsm0RhcNG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of the One who Knows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
