But although she is beautiful, she is also proud and arrogant, and constantly insults and rejects her suitors.  She even rejects noble Prince Richard of Begonia, and mocks him as \"King Thrushbeard,\" even though she secretly likes him.  Finally, her father loses patience with his rude daughter and declares that since she has rejected every man who has come to court her, she will be married to the first beggar who comes to the gate.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/dyk67QIsvHz6LHe1RiBu1pzwqeJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"König Drosselbart","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
