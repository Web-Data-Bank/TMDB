In 2014, with the partnership of Life-Remodeled, a Detroit-focused non-profit organization, the Cody-Rouge Community rose up alongside over 10,000 volunteers in order to remodel three schools, tear down three burned-out houses, remodel 25 homes of students and their families, board up 254 vacant houses, and remove blight/create beauty on 303 blocks. Cody High: A Life Remodeled project skillfully portrays the powerful stories of community members directly involved, and how their lives are being shaped as beacons of hope within the great City of Detroit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cody High: A Life Remodeled Project","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
