He played for the Calgary Flames, New York Rangers and Chicago Blackhawks. He made 50 million dollars and threw it away on drugs, alcohol and gambling. He reached bottom, and bought a gun intending to kill himself. At the last minute he changed his mind. He wrote a book revealing that, as a teen, he'd been sexually abused by his coach. It created a firestorm of publicity and went on to become a No. 1 bestseller in Canada. Theo starred in a top-rated skating competition reality show and had a cameo in the opening film at TIFF last year. Inspired by the book, the documentary follows Theo's struggle with the aftermath of the book and gives his turmoil a voice.","popularity":1.189,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":140186,"logo_path":"/jK7c4shsoKwG5trE25U98NrCUQR.png","name":"Pyramid Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theo Fleury: Playing With Fire","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
