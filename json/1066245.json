However, unfortunately, the actor passed away mid-way through shooting, and everything stood still.  By 2011, the shooting was wrapped, and the movie was submitted to the Bangladesh Film Censor Board under the initial name, \"Lilamanthan\", not the name it has now. The movie has passed the board through years of stagnancy, only after having its name altered.","popularity":0.698,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"2023-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jibon Jontrona","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
