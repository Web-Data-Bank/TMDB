I have seen the ancient map which will lead you straight into the city. It is also the home of King Trident's sceptre which is used to turn the water into air but you, Black Dog, could use the trident to turn water into gold!  I found this map in one of the many boxes in Harold's Hock Shop. The silly fool doesn't know an expensive item when he sees it. He was going to sell it to me for only ten gold pieces.  Anyway, I had the map in my grasp when that rotten scallywag Galifray took it right from under my nose.  Somehow the  scoundrel managed to trade it for a dragon bracelet. Harold also threw in a magic genie lamp for good luck! I don't know how Galifray does it but he sure has the gift of the gab.  I have managed to persuade Galifray to trade the map for the measly sum of a thousand gold pieces. We will meet you on Black Dragon Isle at the usual time.  Your trusty shipmate,  Sharky","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/voDTv6B11tQsB2iF1MwiSj37kBR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jewel of Secrets","title":"Jewel of Secrets","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
