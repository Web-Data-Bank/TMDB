Mixing the rock stars of the sport with a cast of unknown and up-and-coming heroes, the film explores how we share our dreams through a universal two-wheeled language no matter what our native tongue may be. The sacred ritual of the ride might sound different all across the world – whether it’s a full-face getting pulled down to drop into a big jump line or wheeling a beat-up bike out of a mud hut to pedal to school – but it’s a universal process no matter what language we speak.  There are more than 7000 languages spoken on Earth. In 1887 a Polish-Jewish doctor named L.L. Zamenhof created a new one, a universal second language based on a combination of existing widely-spoken European languages. Its goal, to help bring people together from different ideologies, beliefs, and nations and ultimately to help end war. The language was called Esperanto. Translated into English it means ‘one who hopes.’","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d0WrmsBO9qjt1Peynbn9V8rc4Yt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11117,"logo_path":"/vkZJsXBKKfHZVLMDxuMktZXNmyA.png","name":"Teton Gravity Research","origin_country":"US"},{"id":132414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ten Ninety One","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Esperanto","iso_639_1":"eo","name":"Esperanto"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Spoken Worldwide","title":"Esperanto","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
