Intervened through montage with images of a relaxation and dispersion routine that consisted in going up to the terrace of the building in order to sunbathe, look at the concrete horizon and absorb the energy of the outside from the windows of the apartment. Archive footage, registered in Mini-DV format during another time, invokes the same revitalizing function as the sun, light reflected in flowers that nurture the spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":183353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parquee","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El cuerpo es el soplo cálido","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
