As a way of reliving and deepening what they felt during those days, with the arrival of autumn, a rapprochement trip took place. Alcimar traveled to the state of São Paulo, where he lived with Thais for a month, oscillating between the cities of São Paulo-SP, Cotia-SP, Ubatuba-SP and Paraty-RJ. The archival images that make up this film were recorded by the hands of both, using a Nikon Coolpix S70. The film, Alcimar's first feature film, is also composed of some audio, which was recorded by the duo during the long dialogues of the long month of May 2022.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yTmqdApPiVs0p8db5MtEM8i8zuJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The role of autumn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
