The video unveils a contin- uous editing process that gives cohesion to a series of apparently uncon- nected and fragmented images. In the artist's words, \"It's an ode to the disillusionment of the 90s, to the disorientation caused by excessive tele- vision consumption that gave us the false illusion of a promising future that would never come\".  The piece also documents the way in which Miguel Calderón works, as he instinctively captures everyday situations and behaviors whose strange- ness often transcend socially accepted canons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demonios Juveniles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
