It is as much the need for money as the desire to regain a faded glory that pushes him to attempt this improbable comeback. For two years, the camera will accompany the boxer in his daily life, a man in the grip of his doubts and contradictions. We will discover that the object of the quest is sometimes less important than the quest itself and the company of those with whom we undertake it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gknbJvRdhfTwi6zHPoQW08mqTBC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noble art","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
