Kamikaze means wind of God in Japanese. During WW2 Japanese pilots attacked American aircraft carriers and army ships by dive-bombing their airplanes. For the realization of the second project, I transcribed a part of the diary of another kamikaze soldier from southern Japan, Norimitsu Takushima. By putting in his place a fictional French character, Noé Teissier, this translation sits in a broader contemporary context. The film ultimately reflects relationships to life, to death, to love speaking towards the universal experiences of any soldier.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silence Bleu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
