Having been acquired over five decades, Sir William's collection is truly massive.  The film starts at the beginning of the year when the ex-BR class 03 diesel shunter is started up. There's a lot of steam action too, with the resident 0-6-0 saddle tank engine, seen charging up and down the incredible 1 in 14 gradient of the hill line on training and public open days.  Charlie takes a look around the extensive museum, containing a myriad of railway artefacts. He's shown inside the two royal coaches, the signal boxes, the O gauge model railways and the main station building, re-erected here from Somersham in Cambridgeshire.  Sir William's widow, Lady Judy McAlpine tells us about her late husband's insatiable enthusiasm. There's so much to see and appreciate in this unique private railway.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":122351,"logo_path":"/rimkfoYjXmbhiGwmQ4JNB4fyjH9.png","name":"Transport Video Publishing","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fawley Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
