In his final words, he talks about the legendary gold of the Iowa Indians that he had actually seen in the blue mountains – from which no pale face has yet returned alive. When two Indians appear on the horizon, Tom searches for space – and so the Iowas bring the corpse of Sam, popular for his stomach-turning firewater, to his son Bill. It is assumed that a bear killed him, but doubts soon arise about this theory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":151678,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.S.
