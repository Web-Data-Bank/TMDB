From speaking in tongues to attempting to raise the dead, Charismatic Christians believe they are participating in modern miracles.  But are these miracles real? Are the Apostolic sign gifts in operation today? Cessationist will lovingly and carefully answer this important question by exposing the errors and building a positive case for the real work of the Holy Spirit today.
