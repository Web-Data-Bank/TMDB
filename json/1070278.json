John Graham, the president, has been unable to find the white mineral in sufficient quantities to satisfy the eastern stockholders, and a letter from his partner arrives which brings the disagreeable news that their backers are about to back out, unless, in the language of Missouri, they \"are shown\" something. Graham is in a quandary, and appeals to his stenographer for advice. That young woman has had so little to do in, the office that she is overcome with surprise and confusion. The postman enters and hands Graham a letter and a package. Listlessly the president opens them, but his manner changes and he leaps to his feet with a whoop of joy. There is a chance of saving the company.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
