Mrs. Damm hustles the children into the house and they all get busy tidying things up for the expected guest. The boy feels the importance of the event but his sister is so lackadaisical she can't enter into the spirit of the occasion. Mrs. Damm, in addition to numerous other provisions, goes to the cigar store and orders a box of \"perfectos\" sent home.
