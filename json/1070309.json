For several years, this working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris has been undergoing an urban metamorphosis. In the surrounding buildings, the inhabitants are living this transformation on a daily basis, between resignation, adaptation and aspirations. Through a back-and-forth game between intimate trajectories and the metamorphosis of the city, the film sketches moments in the lives of several of its inhabitants, drawing a portrait of a neighborhood at its turning point.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rrXHi5zgDlukIxTbuBtG1X88t22.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porte de Clichy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
