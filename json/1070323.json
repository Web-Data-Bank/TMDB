Bill, who is a fellow of no small caliber, is looked upon by his companions as a sort of leader, feels a little miffed, but acknowledges she is the real goods and has some occasion to feel proud of herself; at the same time he won't stand for her snubs. The punchers await developments and make up their mind what can't be cured must be endured. The Captain, a classy chap, from a neighboring ranch, puts in his appearance, and asks Mary to go riding with him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
