From Alkali Ike to Shorty Smith, not a man of them had seen the inside of a church in fourteen years; there has never been a sermon preached in the county, and the only hymns that had ever been heard were those of the coyotes. The Rev. Simpson soon set up the \"Rawhide Mission,\" but in spite of the hot weather, the result was a heavy frost. Nobody came even as far as the door, except Black Mike, who was drunk and who thought he was at the XXX saloon. The worthy pastor pleaded, prayed and billed the town without result.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tv7nSvStLq2l5HKtk0EqPAJC1Ti.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
