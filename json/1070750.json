As the pieces of her shattered memory slot back into place, Pam realises she has a deadly decision to make. Starring Diane Morgan as Pam ('Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe', 'Two Episodes of Mash') and Michael Spicer (who also wrote the screenplay) as Paul the rubbish escort, Paradise Males is a blackly comic thriller with an unexpected twist. It's not so much a whodunit, as a 'what-the-hell-is-going-on-here-then'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise Males","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
