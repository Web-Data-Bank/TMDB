It rushes and shortens, it hides and reveals. \"I wanted to make a film about everything on the palm of my hand\". Like a palm, it opens and closes.

Like an orchestra, its heart sinks for a moment, then quakes again, subservient to a mighty man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Y4FzSIW93LGTjvdgHMXTlhJW5X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ukryte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
