High praise was given to the historical costumes by William Orlando, the minimal décor, the sophisticated lighting as well as the musical excellence of the performers. It was also due to the charisma of Renée Fleming; she confessed in an interview, \"I think Manon is my favorite role. I love French music, it is so elegant and delicate stylistically. It has both dramatic and lyrical elements.\" Marcelo Alvarez was thought brilliant in the role of the Chevalier des Grieux, and among the other artists were Jean-Luc Chaignaud as Lescaut, Alain Vernhes as the Comte des Grieux and Michel Sénéchal as Guillot de Morfontaine. The choir and orchestra of l'Opéra de Paris were conducted by Jesús López-Cobos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s1SYsQuMP0SOdm3TSvn6UsMGqqt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":163,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
