It is about Jeanne Duval, a black woman whose real name is not known, muse and companion of the poet Charles Baudelaire. Deleted from the painting by Courbet himself, Jeanne returned to the surface as if the paint pigments could not bear her erasure. Between archival footage and animation, this documentary paints a worthy portrait of the woman who inspired some of the most beautiful poems in the French language, although she has been mistreated by the poet's biographers, blinded by their prejudice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u8RAwmsE8krZcA4uAb9VxoOebJX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La femme sans nom, l'histoire de Jeanne et Baudelaire","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
