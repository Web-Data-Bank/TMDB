Smith's \"regular guy\" Mike embodies a series of all-American male stereotypes, from the classroom to political candidacy, assuming the roles of college prep, cowboy, train engineer and real estate developer. Set to an ironic jingle that recalls an \"Up With People\" anthem, this lampoon of Manifest Destiny concludes with Mike riding, like an ironic Marlboro Man, into the sunset.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":189915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mike and Mark Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Go For It, Mike","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
