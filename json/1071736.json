With chapters all over the world, these days, the club is about having a good time with friends and giving back to the community. But things weren't always so recreational. Dykes on Bikes® Sydney emerged in response to gay hate crimes in the 1980s. The group met on weekend evenings to patrol the streets of Sydney and break up the attacks that were happening. From protectors of the streets to Sydney Mardi Gras icons, this project dives into present-day member accounts of their history, why they continue to ride today and continuing their legacy for future generations. A hybrid of a documentary and visual poem, this is a love letter to the Dykes on Bikes® Sydney.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Py1BFLSZOJSf8p3Hf7kAmix8Yr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dykes on Bikes: An Origin Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
