A brief image of an athletically-focused, playful day at a clearing in the woods ends quickly as the focus shifts to a barking dog and his chain-link leash. The camera fixates on the leash and the viewer suddenly senses the tension and anger of one restrained. The physicality of the piece engages with concepts of the rule of law, some necessary and some not so. We must be cautious to not become victims of our own idealism – without sacrificing our innate sense of justice. The leash goes on seemingly forever, and we contemplate the binds existing in our lives and in the lives of others as the dog’s leash unfurls for the camera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The leash of the dog that was longer than his life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
