He’s a dedicated, cheerful and honest guy who’s fairly happy with his life. And there is one more thing: Ola was born with a mild intellectual disability.  He speaks openly, curious about his own condition, all the while wondering if other people see him mainly as a person with a diagnosis. Why can’t he just be Ola?
