On the occasion of the historic 500th anniversary of the birth of Pope Sixtus V, the mayor of the birthplace of the famous pontiff, hires an author of religious musicals from the Marches, Angelo Santini, to create a show inspired by the famous papal events. Among these Angelo readapts one, under the cumbersome supervision of the village parish priest, and entitles it \"Acqua alle corda\", inspired by the well-known story of the obelisk in St. Peter's Square.The mayor is very pressing on the fact that this show must have an important resonance, and urges Angelo to find a theater company worthy of attracting the attention of the media. Angelo therefore involves a very high-level musical company which, thanks to its autonomy, completely upsets the religious spirit of the work,bringing it to a demented dimension, and consequently triggering unpredictable tensions within the country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uequBGBSBBJwBGCiKfYw1Ly2bvI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water to the Ropes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
