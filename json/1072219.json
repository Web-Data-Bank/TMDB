We are accompanied by Igor Pap, who discovered it together with his friends in 2004. The Moon Shadow cave with its current dimensions is the largest cave in the High Tatras, but it is attacking several Slovak speleological records. Shadow Seekers is a story about Igor's intuition, motivation and determination to discover one of the most difficult to reach and most adventurous caves in Slovakia despite the obstacles. She is a probe into his caveman soul. The film contains authentic shots and situations that arose directly during the discovery of new spaces and the largest vertical shafts underground in Slovakia.
