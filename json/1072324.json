In Switzerland, where they live, political and medical institutions maintain their invisibility. Without a law banning genital mutilation, their right to self-determination does not exist and being themselves is a struggle. Under the benevolent gaze of the director, they tell us about their path to self-discovery and self-acceptance. Intimate confessions and affirmed claims are here a militant act aiming at breaking the taboo, together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vn2HrrASFkJOCb0SHpYo3ku5nWH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le point sur les i","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
