The camera masters and 16mm negative were consequently lost to a devastating fire. Luckily, a lone VHS copy had been made, which spent the next 30 years on the studio shelf. The VHS was found heavily damaged, but a restoration team managed to salvage a fair grade of quality, which has since been remastered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5VAzxKqLdLF3pfeOLshtNjenCv3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Hollywood's Backyard: Topanga in the 1970s","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
