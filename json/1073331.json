Completed in 1962, in the wake of Nigeria’s independence from Britain, the factory is a site where interwoven histories of industrialisation and labour are brought into focus. Observing the comings and goings of workers, and the factory’s assembly and packing lines, Akingbade perceptively highlights the deep-rooted politics embedded in the beverage’s production.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
