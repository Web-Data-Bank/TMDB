Made with home-movies where private experiences or intimate situations, turned public and ex-posed on the web, give rise to new self-narratives. Through tutorials or confessional videos, this work illustrates the dynamics of repetitions and iterations that determine the way we show ourselves on the Internet. The films are particularly centered in the forms of construction and exhibition of genre identities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yCqyYzs2a5WV64hEDlzWjudQ84g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nanouk Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(Self)exhibitions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
