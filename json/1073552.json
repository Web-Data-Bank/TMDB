One man relates how he became a hero, in a comic fashion, while on Army maneuvers; an elderly woman tells of her first visit to the big city; another woman tells how she and her husband invited his boss and his wife to their home for dinner, with the intent of getting the husband a raise, and they wound up in a hospital thinking they had food poisoning. Another story concerns how the police caught a demented-thief who stole from a bank to give money to the poor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wxsFfAKB98cy5AwMgThKOjgKOvI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190380,"logo_path":null,"name":"Geva Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1956-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tel-Aviv Taxi","title":"A Taxi Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
