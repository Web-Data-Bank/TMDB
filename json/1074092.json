Alright, maybe it's not exactly how you'd expect. But when the robots built to serve us start tea-bagging, dry-humping, and kill-shotting humanity out of existence -- gaming supernerd Bernie Meckler knows he alone holds the key to survival. Can Bernie and his super-slacker friends survive horrific murderbot onslaughts, Godzilla-sized Cranebots, AND living in a van with each other for an entire week?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bQKDbQ2D1JFSuc92ekaj2j0P55L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129761,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monumental Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uprising!","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
