In this area where the movie is filmed, people have free access to give a visit and be in touch with animals. The interviewer explains the importance of the preservation of animal species and nature. Baku is a very busy and noisy city. Sometimes people want to escape the chaos of the city, but unfortunately, there are not very well-designed parks or other places where people can be easily in contact with nature. The filmed site is one of the examples where people could visit and be in touch with nature. Although Baku does not have the best nature scene, other regions of Azerbaijan are covered with beautiful nature and green areas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Az…ôrbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Man and the Nature","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
