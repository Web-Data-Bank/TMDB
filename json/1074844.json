For the first time, witnesses from the inside unveil the workings and evoke the backstage of a \"black box\" where capitalism without limits meets totalitarianism and forced confessions. From the economic opening of the late 1980s to the \"zero Covid\" nightmare, the party and its leaders have kept the cult of secrecy, the obsession with control and paranoia as their raison d'être.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Hi8YEbpgwDEF8p91tnp0xrgiRw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99856,"logo_path":"/9pFqulZ9l4nIbakapKqiEVgiu5c.png","name":"Maximal Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Parti, la Chine sous emprise","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
