(parahrapsed from Kathleen Modrowski)  Işıtan’s documentary displays the conflict between the neighborhood residents and the police, with graphic images of violence. It uses a voice-over narration with a dramatic tone describing the events and Turkish folk singer Hakkı Bulut’s song—Gecekondu [Shantytown] (1978). The end of the film declares that it is dedicated to Hasan Kızılkaya murdered on September 2, 1978. It is highly likely that Işıtan’s film is the only surviving film of the People’s Cinema Group.
