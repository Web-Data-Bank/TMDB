Am I blessed?”  The filmmaker twists the question of expression by taking the point of view of the camera and objectifying herself through ultrasonic images of the baby right before birth, and talk with family.  Shooting these images day by day is the process by which the film maker grapples with the question of her own existence. It is, in fact, an attempt to witness her own birth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vlvo5xlbSPj86bd2I25WfUp4cvM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bone and Flesh Cogitation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
