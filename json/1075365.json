Karina, she says, is a famous Hollywood actor who smells of oranges, talks to the stars and does her own stunts. One more sleep, then she finally comes to visit. But instead of an orderly meeting in the Dutch hometown, Lu unexpectedly finds herself in a rusty old Chevrolet – with cowboy boots and wigs in tow. The destination: Poland, where Lu’s grandmother is said to have hidden a lot of money. With this, mother and daughter aka Bonnie and Clyde plan on finally staying together forever. On their Hollywood-like road trip towards the east, always a car length ahead of reality, they attempt to get closer to their dream.","popularity":0.629,"poster_path":"/vL7iTYvMoSNm3ptSrxtQ3CQX54X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123439,"logo_path":"/bykSb5Gv8j95QOXAqr4IBKHPePZ.png","name":"Studio Ruba","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2023-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiddo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
