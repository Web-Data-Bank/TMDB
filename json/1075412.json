Best known as one of the stars of ITV1’s hit series ‘Benidorm’ and a multi award winner including Best Actress at the Berlin International Film Festival (for her unforgettable performance in ‘Ladybird Ladybird’) Chrissy is better known to her fans as one of the most outstanding and outrageous standup comedians of her generation.  From her hilarious routines directed at useless partners (well, men in general) to her journey through the onset of middle age. Crissy’s nonstop blasts of comedy brilliance hit the right note every time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vJmoNDG3Yod2ZXbdOmhrwHQ4TBP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crissy Rock: Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
