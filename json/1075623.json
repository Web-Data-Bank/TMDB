The film settles upon this man, finally, discovering as one might, as a visitor, a pain in a face, the limp pajama over a stump of a leg, the cinches, straps, buckles of prostheses, his happiness and pride, one marvels. Camhi's film manner is without cuteness. Images seemingly are made from whatever vantage point is possible, not from a preconceived angle. Flash frames, light-struck ends are kept if the image beneath is worthy. For it is the image and its information not the style that matters, without sentiment, silently.\" â€“ Anthony Bannon","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bellevue Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
