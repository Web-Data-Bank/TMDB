A cinematographic approach to the history and obsessions of this town. A glance under the skin of everyday life, searching for the open sores in the soul of this would-be metropolis. The objects found: The old lady, listening through the wall. A peepshow for catholics. The making of a planned child. A song for Kurt Waldheim. Fishes from the Danube crashing against kitchenwalls. The torture of playing the zither, etc. A personal statement on my hometown, a work close to the traditions of Austrian experimental film. A coughing up and spitting out.
