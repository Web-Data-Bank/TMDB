While in the middle of a huge deal, Alex cannot afford anybody to sabotage it, not his sneaky ex-wife (Lexi Luna) and especially not his gold-digging new bride (Julia Ann), who has her eye on his money... and on his beloved son Liam (Nathan Bronson).Meanwhile his other son Lucas (Lucky Fate), a degenerate gambler, puts the entire family empire in jeopardy through his ineptitude. As Alexander's personal saga unfolds, the torrid sex lives of his family members come to light in a chain of events that will expose more dirty laundry than they bargained for. Beautifully photographed by the legendary James Avalon, and featuring a star-studded supporting cast headlined by Lilly Bell and Vanna Bardot, Privilege is proof that Gamble has quickly become the adult industry's most electrifying new director.","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/dYAsryvrdRFhLfOPAWmtRmSCEMQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/pXHXO1qKuQEDv8NDvoNmSaV4gvi.png","name":"Wicked Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Privilege","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
