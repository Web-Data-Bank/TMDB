Ceremonies are a way, sometimes agreed upon and sometimes not, of dealing with life situations. They seldom are a way of resolving those situations. Fantasies are our fears and wishes arguing with and sometimes defeating aspects of reality; they may afford insights but never a reality-based solution. -Hugh Thompson","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ceremony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
