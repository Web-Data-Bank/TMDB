A colorful, animated paper collage, the video is assembled from scraps of 1950s and '60s children's books, how-to manuals, science texts and encyclopedias. A \"biography\" using science fiction elements to explore the classic themes (otherness, paranoia, alternate reality) of the genre. The video is a life story constructed from pieces of other stories, much the way we base our ideas of self on pieces of information we receive from our environment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sensing the World by Echo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
