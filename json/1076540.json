An oppressive Habsburg governor. The most famous Swiss apple. And a love story that crosses national divides.  Rossini’s thrilling epic, his final masterpiece with the world’s most famous overture, is his most ambitious, forward-looking and vocally challenging opera. Having become the rallying cry of the 1830 revolution in France, Rossini’s final opera is nothing short of revolutionary itself. Retelling the legend of the Swiss folk hero based on Schiller’s play, William Tell is a grandiose ode to freedom. Staged for the first time in Ireland since 1875, this production is conducted by Fergus Sheil and directed by Julien Chavaz who takes a mythological approach. For him, ‘the story is not just about a remote Swiss community facing Austrian invaders. It is the story of a society that suddenly has to face a threat to its model of civilisation.’","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1Hg2DwvZICElZT1LWMvfcfMbYYm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"William Tell - INO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
