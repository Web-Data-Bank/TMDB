It's the end of a busy life as an ibex, punctuated by tightrope walks along the vertiginous cliffs of the Italian Alps, dodging against lurking predators, and tough duels against his fellow creatures. From his birth, Boque will have survived many dangers hidden in the shadow of the massif: the golden eagle, the fox or the wolf, but also the snow squalls which cover the landscape with a white coat, making all food inaccessible. As he grew up, Boque asserted himself as an ibex respected by his congeners, until he became, like his father before him, the dominant of the herd.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bE4RBaBEQ9QxJmU3za1yaWOKJ0n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Time of a Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
