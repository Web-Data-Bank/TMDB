While the dump provides her with a source of income, it's killing her son. After numerous attempts to heal her child fail, Sang Ly leaves the dump in search of a Cambodian healer from her homeland. In a haunting encounter with the healer, Sang Ly places faith in her culture, hoping to keep her son alive. Her experiences in the countryside cause her to reevaluate her relationships, not only with those she loves, but also with the dump she has come to abhor. In the touching follow-up documentary, Finding Sang Ly, the filmmakers journey back to the Cambodian dump to search for Sang Ly. Four years have passed since losing contact and they are prepared for the worst. The dump, however, continues to surprise and what they discover is far greater than what they set out to find.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oJtGsVya4pY3FI9Xl1caWyo5V44.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The film that inspired the bestselling book THE RENT COLLECTOR.","title":"River of Victory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
