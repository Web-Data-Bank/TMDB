Moussa Touré picks up with them there and then continues to film as they go about their business in the city, looking for food and odd jobs. Taking advantage of his closeness to the children, the filmmaker sets out to take each back to his family. But the road back is beset with difficulties that exemplify the state of Congolese society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fijjoTXmb31hhItHafFOwfwxe9O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poussières de ville","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
