At first glance, this piece with its stringent composition and seeming calm seems to resemble a photograph. What we see is a cropped section of an angled overhead shot of a young man lying bare chested on a carpet.On closer inspection minimal movements can be discerned within this harmonious composition. These minute movements attest to the fact that he is alive: we intuit his breath and heartbeat from the fact that his chest rises and falls gently, and the artery in his neck pulsates.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d1yBtZMMGOmcniHRwiK6TOGEb0d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heartbeat/Armpit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
