Now the film, Until We Are Free, tells her story of courage and defiance in the face of a government out to destroy her, her family, and her mission: to bring justice to the people and the country she loves. The Iranian government would end up taking everything from Shirin Ebadi – her marriage, her home, even her Nobel Prize medallion – but the one thing it could never steal was her spirit to fight for justice and a better future for the women of Iran.","popularity":0.663,"poster_path":"/i5iVEJOYc7Zxwyl1LhwmHcGU2eC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96915,"logo_path":null,"name":"PeaceJam Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shirin Ebadi: Until We Are Free","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
