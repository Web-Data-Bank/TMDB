Her home is a village in Chechnya where she lives with her mother and little brother. She is self-composed by nature and knows what she wants, but is also open to life – which begins to take shape in the form of certain cultural and social concepts. Madina wants to get married; Yakha’s older sister wants a divorce. Her mother is against it – after all, she herself managed to persevere. Together they visit the grave of their father who died in the second Chechen war.","popularity":0.633,"poster_path":"/hZfBxEUQlsqfgBdWPL1BvfS1hkG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193754,"logo_path":"/qNHejwZmoqEwBhOFr3oq4U9Dvad.png","name":"Hype Studios","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":193755,"logo_path":null,"name":"sokurov.fund","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cage is Looking for a Bird","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
