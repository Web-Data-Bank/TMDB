Stuck at a dead end, he is thrilled when The Company pulls him back in the field, but only to train Gen Z newcomer Wihlborg, a prodigy assassin with an attitude. The mismatched pair is asked to eliminate top members of a competing crime syndicate and, in the process, uncover their employer’s true motive: removing the old guard in a full takeover. However, The Company didn’t anticipate that Terry’s experience coupled with the kid’s brilliance would create such an unlikely bond between the two, enabling them to turn it all back on The Company.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104678,"logo_path":"/3SsbZgTQDicxLi5uUS2LCkthsmc.png","name":"23ten","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1786,"logo_path":"/joLFuCWg9e2lweYnFQtRPJKSLlI.png","name":"Dark Castle Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Guy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
