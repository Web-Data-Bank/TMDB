Unrepeated since its first ascent by the Basque Pou brothers and Kiko Cerdá in 2020, Rayu combines heady trad climbing with a burly sport crux on a steep headwall a thousand feet off the deck.  Living on the wall for days on end, the team battles stormy weather, loose rock, and the tension between personal goals and group success. As their psyches and fingertips fray, this adventure classic keeps you right on the edge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kAig2VGAS243CZiaNn3tBltSRi0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rayu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
