Once there, a team kayaked 500km along the spectacular Greenland coast while another team attempted to climb unconquered towering rock-walls.  Among the crew were film maker Claire Riordan and photographer Daragh Muldowney. Between them they captured the range of experiences and emotions encountered by our adventurers; from the harsh realities of life on the North Atlantic in a cramped 49ft yacht, to the heart-achingly beautiful scenery of a landscape under threat; from the vast isolation of the Arctic Circle to feasting with locals on whale blubber, walrus and polar bear stew!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bSJ5pyitFYHzXPSqE33ghYFZFPR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2014-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Galway to Greenland - North of Disko","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
