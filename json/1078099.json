Composed of 17 members and Desmond Tutu, this Commission will be relayed throughout the country by groups called \"Khulumani\" (literally: \"Free the Word\"). For a little over a year, it will invite victims, perpetrators and witnesses of apartheid to tell the truth about the past.  The filmmakers have been authorized to follow this incredible process, which should lead to the re-founding of the nation, for its entire duration. The film focuses on the collective character of the Commission, crossed by ethical, political and philosophical questions, as well as on a few characters, victims and executioners, linked by a common history. They are filmed in their interrogations and their steps to re-establish a link between a past and a possible future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archipel 33\u003e35","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":3984,"logo_path":"/pvOBu9K0zTRuwJW7WII34x17kdz.png","name":"Entre Chien et Loup","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La commission de la vérité","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
