The name derives from the Korean word janchi (meaning ‘feast’ or ‘banquet’), as the noodle dish is traditionally eaten on special occasions throughout Korea, such as at weddings and birthday parties. The word guksu means ‘noodles’ in Korean and they symbolise longevity.  The film culminates with a party, the guests eating janchi guksu and wishing one another long lives filled with joy. Meanwhile, the camera pans to those who are no longer experiencing such joy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Janchi Guksu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
