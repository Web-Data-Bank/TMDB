In their efforts to recover the money they lost in the pyramid scheme, savers suffered many personal and family dramas—in some cases even suicide and murder as a result of unsettled credit-debt accounts. Tragically, the consequences are still being addressed and might never be overcome. The documentary revives this issue at a time when many living witnesses are speaking openly about what happened in TAT and about who the main perpetrators were. Some of the surviving victims give their own statements, which is a rarity in documentaries. One of the goals of the film is for the truth about TAT to come to light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3bmxtLrTBVisIXB7gBWdDp1CafU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2015-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TAT - Transitional Euphoria or National Fraud","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
