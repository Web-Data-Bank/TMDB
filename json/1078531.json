The amphitheater is one of many other public buildings that testify to what was once a lively city on the Via Egnatia.  The theatre was a place for social gatherings, festivals, games and plays. Skopje City Council intends to reconstruct the amphitheater and reopen it for public use. The reconstruction project is estimated to last for three years, and this documentary follows the activities at the meeting point between the distant past and present times. Human curiosity often manifests and satisfies itself through the phenomenon of “scenium”. Contemporary people share the same desires and urges for more or less similar objectives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tv52VlQWnBgBpcw627oZqdpM7WG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Focus Pocus Films","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":76536,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trice Films","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Theatre of Scupi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
