Together they have created an oasis where they can be themselves, a group of friends with a mishmash of backgrounds and sexualities where no one apologizes to anyone. Over the course of a day, they move from forest raves to house parties, mixing alcohol and drugs with reflections on love and existence, right up to the inevitable going home. Blomster offers a playful and associative close-up of a group of young people’s search for belonging, seasoned with humor, civilizational criticism, and sensual realism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fGsHjT7gi7RfmnbzvulPIhWn9Bi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Young love, thrill-seeking, and hallucinatory Swedish summer night in Neil Wigardt’s visually explosive debut.","title":"Synthetic Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
