During his presentation, he presents business-oriented ideas and it turns out that he secretly represents an ancient society that wants to commercialize art. Meanwhile, one of the students, Irma (Isabelle Grill/Hilda Krepper), is commissioned by God to create the perfect work of art and thereby becomes a target for Jack and his company. The debuting directors from the collective KonstAB, however, do not let Irma stand alone in the fight, but give her support from the school’s two lecturers and not least a Danish Dadaist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k4VXph7bwfqktJoo25thR7aJMrw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gallery of God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
