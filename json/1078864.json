It was the time of the party discipline, in which the free thinking and free behavior of individuals meant heresy. This is a drama about political showdown, about the metamorphosis of high-level intellectuals ready to do anything to defy the authorities and retain their privileges. At the same time - this is also a love story that, under the political circumstances that accompany it, is misused precisely because of those well-known higher goals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hMEI06FgwMTVbCpn0gFt4S1lSev.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25204,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTS","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":11613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radiotelevizija Beograd","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Files No.128","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
