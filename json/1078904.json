The film follows two teenage boxers from the forgotten suburbs of Buenos Aires on their way to their debut bout. It will be decided in the ring whether they can continue to hope that one day they will leave the lack of prospects in their neighborhood behind in order to \"be someone\". Youthful enthusiasm meets harsh reality when some of her colleagues form a boxing union.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4eEDnVVNFmN5kbGb7VoQ8XR0q5r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143859,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Caminante Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2012-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Will you ever be somebody?","title":"Boxeo Constitución","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
