Catapulted to worldwide notoriety in 1999 by The Ninth Hour, a sculpture of Pope John Paul II toppled by a meteorite, Maurizio Cattelan's work has bordered on criminal activity (breaking into a gallery and stealing another artist's work) and regularly defies good taste - Him features Hitler in prayer and sold earlier this year for a whopping Â£12,000,000. Building his career on evasion, trickery and subversion, Cattelan is perhaps not the most reliable of interviewees, but ex-girlfriends, family members, collectors and dealers build a compelling and intimate portrait of an enigmatic figure. Bold, witty and playful as a Cattelan work itself, is this film really all it seems?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cgDN7MY0bDwxNeG7KtuLaN0oasv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art World's Prankster: Maurizio Cattelan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
