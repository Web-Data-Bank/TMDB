Chance, fleeting meetings between the filmaker and passers-by are caught on film. A homeless man builds a Christmas tree from trash and discarderd cans on 42nd Street. Ted, the bird-man, makes his daily rounds, feeding thousands of pigeons. A man, believing himself to be a prophet, makes ritualized signals towards a place that only he can see, mediating between the stained sidewalk and the sky over New York. Between the immediacy of documentary photography and the more stylised pictoral juxtapositions, the spectator is invited on a resolutely singular and personal visit of the city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xNjVuIUyZF8ZjYQkd8eQwrCvOxz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Grace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
