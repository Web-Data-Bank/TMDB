Sophie arrives home from 10 hours of facial feminization surgery in a haze of pain and anesthesia. Waiting for her are Morgan, her queer actor girlfriend, and Randy, her country singer brother â€“ both just starting to get to know each other. As Sophie recovers, Morgan and Randy unite against a tragically unhelpful home nurse Donna, their common enemy on a difficult night made bearable with humor, love, music, and weed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gSCYR2AgNU98OLC9ZzRMemcqpOd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Funny Face","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
