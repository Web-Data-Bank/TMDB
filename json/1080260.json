Or \"1001 sonatas’ - each lasting about a minute but in total being  one of the longest pieces ever written?  Like a postmodern Erik Satie the Belgium composer Boudewijn Buckinx is using music history  as a playing field. The classical music audience is irritated, the avant-gardist wrinkles his  nose...  \"Daisies in a Meadow\" - that's how Buckinx described his \"1001 Sonatas” for violin and piano,  They play a leading role in our film, in the supporting roles the Spanish sun and the Belgian  rain. The latter, however, did not show up at the set - just as you always have to be prepared  for surprises with Boudewijn Buckinx.  \"Why is my music so simple? - Why is my music so complex?\" With a wink, Buckinx gives  various answers to these recurring questions.  The portrait of an immensely productive artist who is radically taking his own path.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yJAzp9k9wV7kWMXNdOBQIlf1S2b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viola Rusche \u0026 Hauke Harder","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To B or to B Flat - the composer Boudewijn Buckinx","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
