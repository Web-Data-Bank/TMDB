Will you believe that JoJo’s become the Brown Bomber? Doesn’t matter, because you will believe in Palookaville.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1t0vV9hYoZm0ldp76wV6q8kxr0h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brokenhorse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Things get turned upside down when JoJo wakes up believing he’s Joe Louis - one of boxings greatest legends...","title":"Palookaville","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
