Described by Martin Hayes as \"the John Coltrane of Irish Music\", Potts' came to cult prominence in the 1970s for his unrivalled avant-garde settings of Irish dance tunes as well as his notoriously reclusive personality, shying away from public performance and the music industry at large.  Weaving a tapestry of archival footage, never-before-seen recordings of Potts, and musical performances from leading contemporary fiddlers Aoife NÃ­ Bhriain and Liam O'Connor, the film offers a three-dimensional portrait of the enigmatic Dubliner; his music, his mercurial personality, and his many years of service as a Dublin fireman, including his involvement in the 1936 Pearse Street fire, described as \"one of the most traumatic events in the Brigade's history\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tommie Potts: The Fireman Fiddler of The Coombe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
