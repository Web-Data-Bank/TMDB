The oldest film footage used in it are copies of a privately owned 16 mm B/W film and date from the 1930s, when the SS-Ahnenerbe, under the direction of SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Dr. Herbert Jankuhn of the CAU Kiel, carried out large-scale excavations on the site of the old settlement within the semicircular rampart from 1930 onwards and unearthed a wealth of significant finds. Further photographs come from the excavation of the 1960s under the direction of Dr. Kurt Schietzel (CAU Kiel).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speaking of Haithabu ... any questions?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
