Interviewing each one of them in their home contexts, we followed three of the twelve, who travelled for the first time from the isolated coast of Siberia, the mountains of Colombia, and the deserts of Botswana. Geographically diverse, the twelve elder's messages are unified what needs to be done to change the course our planet is taking. Mindfulness may be mainstream, but this film delves into the depths of what it really means to be human.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nzdl6c4LYl2qHiTpfahDakaDEHR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cause and Effect Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Twelve","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
