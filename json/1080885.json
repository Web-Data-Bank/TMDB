Using techniques of German expressionism, it examines the social and institutional forces that inform one's subjective self-definition. Stark contrasts, are combined with harsh prison reality with escape into the fantasy, beauty, and grace of classical ballet. The conflict is underscored by elements of the sound track: reverberating prison noises, the uncompromising music of punk rock and voice-over readings from the poetic works of notable writers and political prisoners Oscar Wilde and Breyton Bretonbach.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5J8hjQDKWS0qlriIbdsPbCvF1IH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PALE ANGUISH KEEPS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
