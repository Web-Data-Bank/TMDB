But the commander of the army has other ideas, and then the emperor returns, very much alive.  Drottningholm Palace Theatre (Drottningholms slottsteater in Swedish), located at Drottningholm Palace in Stockholm, is one of the few 18th century theatres in Europe that is still used as a theatre with original stage machinery. The beautiful rococo backdrop is the starting point for this production of Agrippina. The Italian conductor and harpsichordist Francesco Corti, a regular collaborator of the orchestras Les Musiciens du Louvre and Il Pomo d'Oro, presides over Handelâ€™s music which is bursting with originality and fun, as well as carefully considered moments of great beauty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aNf34od8hDfVsgCGpaDhTTkhDnt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agrippina - DPT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
