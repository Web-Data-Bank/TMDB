The film weaves together video shot by teens and by the filmmaker, as they work together to make a film and create expressive outlets for youth in the community. They organize dances and community events and paint a mural. At the same time, with humor and pathos, these young people raise issues around violence, feeling misunderstood by adults and lacking respect in their community. Set in the small town of Sitka, Alaska, home to a large Alaska Native population, the video chronicles their creativity, concerns and dreams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3pYmzz2q1qUt1Dfd8x7lsTgXm5H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75306,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Day Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Loitering","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
