The film includes vividly charged discussions with Audrey, who insists she is Superman. Playful and arresting, Audrey de-cloaks from Clark Kent to Superman, revealing her “secret identity” as a boy. She does push-ups, practices flying, vehemently declares “I wanted to be a boy when I got borned, you know, outta your tummy!” and imagines “saving the police from the bad guy,” all the while drawing us into her state of transformation. The unscripted narrative is built through the collaboration of mother and daughter; Audrey is youthfully honest and willing to reveal her inner emotional state.  She is open as only a six-year-old could be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Audrey Superhero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
