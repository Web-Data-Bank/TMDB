But as human habitat continues to encroach on the wilderness, wolves are becoming a more familiar sight. For some people, they are even pets (even if that means you have to put a chain around your fridge). This beautifully shot, BC-made film looks at the complex and evolving relationship between wolf and human: how the call of the wild still pulls on us, and how wolves are compelled to live alongside us. One of them, Takaya (named by the Songhees First Nation) became world famous after claiming a scattering of tiny islands off Vancouver Island as his territory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8N5jrBdtMahyDPnSmlGEeY42qNz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Part of the Pack","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
