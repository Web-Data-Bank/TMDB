This movie takes place after the events from the Banjo-Tooie game. Those who follow the series will definitely like and understand the movie more. I did this movie cause no one has really done a Banjo-Kazooie parody before plus I love the series and wish they'd continue on the old story timeline; not redo it like in Grunty's Revenge.  This is my version of how I thought the actual game would one day be done with pokes here and there.  I'd like to thank everyone who was in it, cause there would be no movie without you guys. Thanks to Richie for DOT Technology and flash direction.  Enjoy!  Commentary version of this movie is also available on our website! - Pikanjo, Newgrounds","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sLsm7MIXBVMx7XjdBEdSTWQfN5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Banjo-Threeie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
