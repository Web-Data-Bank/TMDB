Totò and Vicé are timeless creatures, bewildered and misplaced, that roam about Palermo, marooned and empty; an urban journey and waking life between memories and dreams in one magic night. Out from a timeless cave, their story of sanctification crosses the suburbs, reaches the city and it's bowels, showing the real settings of Scaldati's writing and cosmogony.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hRCu7ymirxkHQsV3mqIT0O8nAKb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toto and Vice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
