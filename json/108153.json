Their routine regularly consists of Dave choosing work over spending time with her, and Karen retreating into her journal or iPod. When Dave opens up his 25th high school reunion invitation to see photos of himself - a person he no longer resembles - he begins reconnecting with old friends, including members of his old high school band, The Groaners. Suddenly Dave begins to find ways to spend more time with Karen, and, for the first time, he puts his career on hold.","popularity":1.506,"poster_path":"/vXFSRBACZmRx5AAy5bJVdbe9IhN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock the House","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7}
