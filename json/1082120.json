Panicked and with no clue as to who could have committed the murder, they decide to bury the body in order to keep the secret between them and ensuring that nobody will have to take the fall. To their shock, they are soon contacted by a mysterious stranger - who possesses a videotape of the burial - and become the targets of a diabolical extortion plot. Is it the disgruntled former employee out for revenge? Or could the true culprit be hiding amongst the six of them? As the blackmailer carries out his plan, the six partners - driven by the need for self-preservations - quickly turn on one another, and the bodies begin to pile up until only one - the one who's been holding the strings all along - is left standing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1kGGFJ1UD9yXyX4C0pur1JJWqQc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Planted Evidence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
