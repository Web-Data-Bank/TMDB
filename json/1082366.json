FYI muscle stud Aryx Quinn has been hanging around the Can-Am gym and studios trying to catch the eye and impress Boss Sexton to make him a Can-Am exclusive like Drake Davenport and Michael Vineland. You have to wonder if Aryx actually likes and respects the two exclusives, or is he faking his respect as part of a revenge plot against them for what they did to his buddy Rio Garza in \"The Arena 3\". What Quinn doesn't know is just how much he'll have to suffer yet to be a Boss Sexton exclusive.. So let the suffering begin. \"Arena 4\" begins with Quinn buttering up Davenport in the Can-Am gym. Boss Sexton's dramatically sexy lighting designed especially for The Arena series shows off Davenport, Vineland, and Quinn to their muscle popping max. Humbling himself to Davenport, Quinn says \"I'm from a tiny, provincial, narrow minded wrestling federation back east\". Humble? Aryx Quinn? Will Davenport and Vineland fall for it?","popularity":1.404,"poster_path":"/yIyYYyQTLLEvQM3y5aMlfKZTZ9J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123914,"logo_path":"/alu5yiZG8cFfrMBgnATh4hqTCyV.png","name":"Can-Am Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arena 4","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
