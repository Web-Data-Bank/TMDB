This dark destroyer of goodness has much to celebrate tonight, for handsome hero Haze is in his grip at last.  Haze (portrayed by a determined Derek Fox) looks to be every inch the unbeatable hero. From his uncompromising ass to his brilliantly exposed, rock-hard trunk of a torso, this masked man is not one to mess with. But looks can be deceiving, and Haze is bound, totally at the mercy of the insidious Rotine, who uses never before seen technology to overpower the weakened warrior, reducing him to a mere puppet.  Yet simply having Haze isn't nearly enough for the shadowy scoundrel. He wants Bullet...and he'll stop at nothing to add the unsuspecting hero to his collection of dwindling destroyers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/16OKuUMTVkRUmTKvLXBdoTEAstu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123914,"logo_path":"/alu5yiZG8cFfrMBgnATh4hqTCyV.png","name":"Can-Am Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bait Tricked Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
