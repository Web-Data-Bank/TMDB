The film examines the cyclical nature of workplace trauma and the relentlessness of the nursing profession. With the use of movement and dance, waves of deep-seated expression move through her as she tries to find home. Disjointed and overwhelmed, she is increasingly unable to connect to her outside world and no longer able to separate hospital life from herself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fyGds87q5aIiQfRH2Vu2j0QJVuV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tidal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
