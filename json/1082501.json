Despite the declared moral superiority, the little nation is rife with inequality, apathy and a strengthening authoritarian framework. For the 24-hour holiday, citizens are encouraged to share their blessings with the less fortunate. Predictably, the practice at times seems more like performance art rather than a community service. The story revolves around two pregnant cousins, Sila and Marilu, both throwing fundraisers for their babies' birthday funds, ultimately vying for a top donation from their rich Aunt Cara, a self-indulgent playwright. While the cousins duel for the top dollar, we drop in on the different experiences populating this patchwork community and listen in on some familiar challenges.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6QTOjTUdjnSNaxc5L948OGwHWRj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sovereign","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
