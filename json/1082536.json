During each casting session, Radziszewski questions his subjects on the topics of shame, exhibitionism and voyeurism. This work not only provides a reexamination of the art historical difference between appearing naked and posing nude but also examines how people rationalize being without clothes in an art venue versus a public space. To break down mental barriers and overcome embarrassment, Radziszewski asks his models to gradually take off their clothes over the course of the session, and to his surprise many are ready to engage willingly for the sake of art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/plQEouViEbU5bkt5gq1EoT1vyn0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Backstage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
