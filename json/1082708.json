The text is the original Shakepearean, but the characters' personalities are changed, so for example, Polonius (originally a doddering old man) becomes Polonia a scheming femme fatale, who is plotting to get her younger sister Ophelia (who she controls through the use of addictive drugs) married into the royal family. It's dramatically shot, and is not so much a modern version (there are no references or images of the modern world at all) as a lateral concept.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/33FaiWpQLbJKsltpdoVGpMEXUj5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hamlet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
