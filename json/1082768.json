This is the story of the road to independence as it was dreamt about and experienced by the Congolese, with their loathing of particularly odious colonial regime, and their visions of song-filled tomorrows.  And it’s the story of « Indépendance cha cha » an extraordinary political hit song by the mythical band African Jazz, that became in the ‘60s the anthem of every African independence movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indépendance Cha Cha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
