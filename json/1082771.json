It also is to honor those French residents of the first generation, who lost their lives in the Invasion and those who survived and carried on the spirit year after year. The second generation has been taught by their parents to never forget the sacrifices that were made. The veterans who visit Normandy over the years can attest to the hospitality of these caring and loving people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"D-Day Veterans Return to Normandy - 75 Years Later","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
