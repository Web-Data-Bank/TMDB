Some live here, others travel for the rehearsal weekends, returning home for a few days. They all share a love of making theatre and a desire to address relevant social issues on stage. Marianne, who also directs the plays, writes them and they rehearse on her cold barn floor. They are about the conflicts in our society - the new work is about food: the consumption of meat, consumerism, vegetarianism and bulimia. After rehearsals, the participants sit together over coffee and cake in cigarette smoke, planning, gossiping and exchanging ideas about what is happening in their lives. In this motley community, everyone has their own burdens, worries, hopes and problems. But everything is put on the table with an openness that quickly makes it clear that this is not just about playing theatre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every first Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
