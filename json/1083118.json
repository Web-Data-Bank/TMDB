For those of you not familiar with my work, this statement may not mean much. But take it from me, this movie has over-the-top adrenaline and will go down in history as the greatest dangerous game hunting movie ever made. Filmed entirely on location in Tanzania, East Africa during the 2005 hunting season, Death Rush takes you on a journey through nine fabulous hunts for monster rogue bull hippo and huge Cape buffalo. Tossed in for good measure is a hunt for an incredible Selous bull elephant the likes of which few hunters ever see.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yB4dhno4BbU5Oo2CPVRL2BByLBQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death Rush","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
