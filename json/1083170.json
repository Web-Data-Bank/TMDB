For thirty years, he's lived a reclusive life working seven days a week on his art, passing through phases of Mummies, Portals, Shrines, Icons, and hand-sized ceramic pieces he calls Stones. His work transcends our modern pathological consumption as well as the consumer art that defines our society. We step into his world of dreams, transformed by a spiritual consciousness that blends Christianity with ancient gods and Paganism, and Reality with the Metaphysical. Spinosa guides you on a journey into the psyche, both ancient and fresh in an Archaic Revival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1uoRTHAVrJZgPJx4YrMmYtHXJGx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A humble mind... and the search for meaning.","title":"Divine Instinct","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
