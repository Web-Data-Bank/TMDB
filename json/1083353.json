Also included are Target Tokyo, a 1945 documentary narrated by Ronald Reagan, which follows the first bombing raid on Tokyo by B-29 Superfortresses, and another World War II short film, Air War Against Japan.  Appointment in Tokyo: Featuring enemy film taken from captured Japanese newsreels, this 1945 documentary depicts MacArthur's long struggle to fight his way back to the Philippines, after his enf-rced evacuation, and beyond to Japan.

Chester Nimitz went from Hawaii through the Gilberts, Marshalls, and Marianas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xzk1JIPnMKFoOyatGE9la4uYbax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117151,"logo_path":null,"name":"GoodTimes Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pearl Harbor Payback/ Appointment In Tokyo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
