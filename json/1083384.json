From the fragments of memories and their own film archive, veterans Pavlo and Yurko assemble a mosaic of the causes and consequences of today's Russian-Ukrainian war - from the end of 2013 to today. The authors went to the front as volunteers, visited the hotspots of Donbas, created the home-made drone \"Furia\", which is now named after one of the best air reconnaissance units. And all this time they continued to create in order to show the world the truth about the terrible war that became possible in the 21st century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tB9avmjiMFvgJVimTTGqgSwOLxd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61133,"logo_path":null,"name":"UkrStream TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life to the Limit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
