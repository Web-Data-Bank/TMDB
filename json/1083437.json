Shot on location, this exhilarating documentary brings to life the Sahara’s cruel history and the conflicts that still plague its people. THE SAHARA recounts the story of kings who once led caravans of 30,000 people across the desert, bearing riches beyond imagination. It tells of Roman death squads that exterminated the citizens of the Empire’s most bitter rival and how the Foreign Legion crafted a legend out of last stands and lost causes. From the fabled metropolis of Timbuktu to the shores of Tripoli, THE SAHARA is an illuminating exploration of this unforgiving and remote land of myth and mirage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yJd9BRptjjYl3lv8NKYVKjz80hE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sahara: The Forgotten History of the World's Harshest Desert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
