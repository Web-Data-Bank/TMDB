However, it was not until the groundbreaking Hail the New Puritan in 1986, that the relationship between the two artists was deeply cemented. Originally commissioned as an arts documentary by Channel 4 of the BBC, Hail the New Puritan turned the genre on its head, presenting a highly stylized and fictionalized version of a typical day in Clark’s life – an “anti-documentary”, as Atlas has called it.  The two artists also worked closely together on another Channel 4 production, Because We Must (1989), which was full of extreme theatricality in its dance, choreography, scenery, costumes, and directorial position.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wluO661aBBQmDeTDeadC6qID1DN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Prune Twin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
