Cage Match Refractions is a computational animation. It is based on a single sports photograph. The original photo depicts a startling moment of equilibrium in a maelstrom of violent maneuvers. Cage Match Refractions re-animates the content of this photograph of an MMA cage match. Cage Match Refractions uses populations of points - let’s call them “automatons” - that spread across and displace areas of the photograph. The automatons are divided into two groups. One group is comprised of “random walkers” which scatter across the photo, taking bits of photo-flesh with them. The other group is comprised of “hill climbers”. The hill climbers are better at swarming the photo; they are agile at displacing big chunks of photo-flesh. Thus the photograph re-animates as a now-decomposable entity that is prey to the swarming predators.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cage Match Refractions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
