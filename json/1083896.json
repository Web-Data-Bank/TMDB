Burden articulates the process of creating The Big Wheel, a 6,000-pound, spinning cast-iron flywheel that is initially powered by a motorcycle, and discusses its relation to his earlier performance pieces and sculptural works. Addressing his motivations and the meaning of this potentially dangerous mechanical art object, Burden discusses such topics as the role of the artist in the industrial world, \"personal insanity and mass insanity,\" and \"man's propensity towards violence.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q3d3bh9mcXt4dPNVkhQvOrmpdbK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Wheel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
