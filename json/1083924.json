Following the release of “The Good Times Are Killing Me” in 2016, this new film has been in the making for over 3 years and features talented riders from across the globe. The action-packed movie focuses on fixed gear tricks and riding, but also features BMX freestyle, bikelife wheelies, and extreme mountain bike riding.  The film is centered on what FOAD has become known for: riding fixed gear bikes in unusual ways; fixed gear freestyle (FGFS), wheelies through city traffic, and even tracklocross over snow and dirt. The film ushers in the next generation of top fixie riders, showing off their skill in places like San Francisco, Paris, Colombia, New York City, and Los Angeles. These top-level fixed gear riders bring their unique take on riding; doing tricks, skids, and wheelies in some of the most dynamic cities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FOAD: Last Try - A Bike Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
