MARCO DENETTI: Harte is in white trunks, Denetti in blue. As the match begins you'll be amazed by Denetti's aggressiveness and the verbal abuse heaped on Harte.\r BOUT #2: JIMMY ROYCE VS. BEAU HOPKINS: No matter what angle or side you look at these grapplers, it's a turn-on.\r BOUT #3: JOHNNY LIGHTNING VS. TROY LUCAS: Johnny proves that whether it's on the mat or on your feet, he is a worthy competitor - and this matchup is indeed more competitive than most.\r BOUT #4: PAUL PERRIS VS. JOHN ST. JAMES: With his sexy muscularity, his incredible ass, his martial arts ability, his very limber body, and his ultra handsome face, Paul Perris has come on the Canadian scene with a thunderous roar. Whether he wins or loses is not important. It's how he looks doing either which is. To show off more of Paul Perris, in this oil matchup, we induced him to grapple in a thong. Paul Perris was one of the wrestlers John St. James wanted to (foolishly) grapple and defeat.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/qypmsU1CqRjV5fWQEQHv0WKCXhu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123914,"logo_path":"/alu5yiZG8cFfrMBgnATh4hqTCyV.png","name":"Can-Am Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1993-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canadian Musclehunk Oil Wrestling 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
