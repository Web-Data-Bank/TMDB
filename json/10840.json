The narrative is non-linear with no dialog and loosely follows the song lyrics and chorus. The video feels like a very compressed version of an epic Miyazaki film. The story follows two police officers in a futuristic setting in their repeated attempts at rescuing a mysterious winged girl.","popularity":6.037,"poster_path":"/bQIsgvkGaKAgqkiRi1IOmb37dlm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10342,"logo_path":"/eS79pslnoKbWg7t3PMA9ayl0bGs.png","name":"Studio Ghibli","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Your Mark","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":122}
