The video was made when the city was besieged by the Russian army. The diaristic and personal character of the bloggerâ€™s perspective is confronted with the horrors of war documented via her phone camera. In April 2022 the Freefilmers collective translated Zagreba's video diary into English, French, Polish, Portuguese, German, and Spanish. The circulation of the diary was also a way of doubting and subverting the protocols of online presence and the market-regulated visual ecologies of social media in times of war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 weeks of hell in 7 minutes: a video diary from Mariupol","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
