While the walk is mediated via digital environments (personal videos, recorded conversations, google maps, etc.), it is based on various footage and chats with different people with whom Kazmina has friendships, intimacies, partnerships, and shared walks. To a large extent, the walk consists of the footage of the documentary project Underwater on which Kazmina has been working since 2015. From the nowadays' perspective of Russia's full-scale invasion, the work observes the chains and ruptures of collective digitized sensitivity, as well as fragile relations between bodies and territories that are neglected within the logic of informational warfare.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contemporary History of Ukraine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
