Stunned by the gigantic scale of the project and feeling betrayed by the elected officials, the village mobilized. There will be work, energy, disappointments. And there will be a victory. Each one taking part in his own way in the destiny of his village, it is a new political landscape which takes shape. Shaking up the well-oiled wheels of a system, this struggle tells of the very contemporary urgency to finally get involved in what concerns us.","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":"/kFQtBDyPEVIdjCrKW1E6TWeUFnF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Des cailloux dans la chaussure","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
