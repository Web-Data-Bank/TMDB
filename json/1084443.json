The global live-play game sensation drew millions of daily users to its frenetically fun trivia challenges and cash prizes, attracting celebrity fans including Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Neil Patrick Harris, Jimmy Kimmel, and Kelly Clarkson. But its success was undone by corporate clashes, cast changes, and a tragic death. Told through the eyes of former host Scott Rogowsky and other first-person players from inside and outside the company, the film documents the real-life comedy and tragedy that unfolded in front of and behind the cameras.","popularity":1.925,"poster_path":"/cgLfMFQAJ3bn67L7D0Y4MUXF4fg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35713,"logo_path":"/hDWeo4RKwI6JjRLwHg9dVdaRHbd.png","name":"Left/Right","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glitch: The Rise & Fall of HQ Trivia","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
