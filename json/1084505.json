A film of emotions and anxieties, fed by my memories, my obsessions, my fantasies and my fears...\r To make you feel the convulsions of the flesh. To light the fuse of desire to get lost in a labyrinth of secret and mysterious pleasures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cuvsBgfhz3mO2o7eQJbLGgXejag.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lose Yourself With Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
