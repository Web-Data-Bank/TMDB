Mediating on the gaze and Black women’s particular embodied realities, Gary also re-contextualizes contemporary social media footage. Creating conceptual links for each viral clip to a character, event, or thematic element from Morrison’s story, the film emphasizes questions around the book’s themes of internalized and externalized anti-blackness in contemporary culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ugePOUK3uMbi8Fj1penwyCzOxav.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quiet As It’s Kept","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
