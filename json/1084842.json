The candidates are forced to endure long torture scenes, which they cannot stop once begun, including strange incisions in different parts of the body with sharp instruments of various sizes, the use of cigarettes and blowtorches to burn the skin, the crushing of the toes at the point of a hammer, and other twisted things that leaving the girls as bleeding remains.
