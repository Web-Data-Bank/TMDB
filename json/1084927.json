Either way, this one could easily be subtitled \"Cute Little Blondes Which Takes It In The Ass\" (grammatical incorrectness intended). Hosts Jim Holliday and Jill Kelly take the introductions on the road - from the Malibu Hills to the streets of Los Angeles: Imperial Highway, Century Blvd., Victory Blvd., Santa Monica Blvd., get the idea? The scenes are as scintillatingly backdoor hot as the box cover is cute. The third time is definitely the charm in this series...and fans of Jill and/or Jim will not want to miss the ending. It is a shocker.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/wv8oOLXsPuA5JFMgrb3NfoNqV1k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trash Talkin' Coeds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
