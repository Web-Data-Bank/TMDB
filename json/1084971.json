DEAD TIME is the story of two sisters, Wendy and Julie, who grapple with drugs, crime, prostitution, family, and ultimately hope for their future. Always one careless step away from death, the sisters attempt survival in spite of major pitfalls in their lives. DEAD TIME follows Wendy’s turmoil through one failed marriage to Mark, followed by a relationship with convicted criminal Reg— a drug dealer into selling large quantities of cocaine, hash, and heroin. Julie on the other hand finds herself delving into all things taboo—prostitution, the porn industry, and excessive use of LSD. Like a house of cards ready to topple, their lives play out through a series of revelations and efforts to regain control over their inner worlds.\" - Jason Beaudry, CINEFEST 2005","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
