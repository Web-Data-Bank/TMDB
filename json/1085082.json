Caught is a short story which contains a little bit of love, considerable violence, but mainly humour. It gives us an insight into a situation that most people can relate to, a situation that a lot of people have already experienced, but everyone desperately wants to avoid… or don’t they? Though the film is short, it’s larger than you expect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k8EXxoSIZybVbavmpx0Z7XYPFwR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caught","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
