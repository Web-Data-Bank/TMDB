This is the story of Kátia, chief of the Akrãtikatêjê people, of Manuel, chief of the Munduruku people and of José Manuyama, a teacher of Kokama origin. The three narrate the threats to their territories promoted by large-scale mining, monoculture, oil extraction, logging and the construction of hydroelectric plants. Interconnected by the voice and ancestral thoughts of Ailton Krenak, these accounts of resistance present us with other ways of existing and walking in the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazonia Latitude Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The film is a journey through images to the end of the world as we know it and to an immersion with the world that we have chosen not to know, but without which we will no longer exist.","title":"Stepping Softly on the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
