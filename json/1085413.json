It will challenge the viewer’s own perspectives on life choices, shame, inheritance, love, and destiny, in a way that forces you to realize that most people’s lives are different from what you might imagine. And as with all of life’s most difficult choices, there is no single right answer.  The Kingdom is fundamentally about choices. What is right, what is wrong, what can you live with and how can you justify those choices to yourself. As the brothers’ father says at the beginning of the story:  “The agony of choice, do you know what that is? When making the choice is what strangles you, not the choice itself. When you know that no matter what you choose, you’re going to lie awake at night torturing yourself over whether you made the right choice.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193169,"logo_path":"/lYpVEuowKPztz7P80RGZYeyyOH7.png","name":"Redpoint Productions","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Kingdom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
