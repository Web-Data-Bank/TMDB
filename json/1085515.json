While the setting is unusual the film addresses a wide range of emotions and morality; Love, deceit, frustrated longings and human dignity.  Victor, the eponymous hero of the film, is torn between his desire for the supermodel Kate le Font and the genuine affection of his co-worker Herdis. Victor's story comes to a head when a crooked traffic warden accuses him to hide his own crimes. With Herdis' help our hero narrowly avoids disaster.  In a surprisingly complex plot, the film illustrates the dangers of repressed emotions, the liberating power of love and the ultimate triumph of good. All this takes place within the microcosmic context of the traffic warden's world which becomes a reflection of all human drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nhdD6Ui0eDBxMaW86iUgaAwhvLU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Factory (IS)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"√çslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viktor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
