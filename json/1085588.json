It's nostalgic for former singles. And it is preparatory for future singlesugh.The solo evening talks about dating, relationships and, of course, singleness, but, as the comedian says, it also turns out that being single is not always a miserable thing. There are so many bad dates that you choose to be single. Fruzsi talks about her attitude towards having children as a single person, and of course she also talks about the social pressure related to this. We also asked him how he felt about being filmed in public, and how different it is to stand-up with cameras recording his every word and every move.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nP46pM1kZzsgTvefahXnv0D4b9H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ács Fruzsina: Véletlenül Szingli?!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
