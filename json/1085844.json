Quiet, mysterious, the woman is an artist on the way to Meðalland to sketch. Always ready to take advantage of an opportunity, the young man adjusts his itinerary to help the beautiful artist, and with luck, he thinks, help himself add another notch to his sexual belt. But all is not what it seems in this world.
