They are raised and taught who they are and who they should become.  They’re expected to fit into an idealized mold of the perfect “boy” or “girl.” What happens when someone doesn’t fit that mold…  Through interviews paired and poetic images Formless creates a portrait of the trans body. The film pairs sketched animations with live-action bodies to match and highlight differences in body shapes and to create a contrast between the “ideal” mold of a gendered body and the real bodies that trans and gender non-conforming people live in. It is an honest exploration of dysphoria, euphoria, and the molds that society offers. The body is a deeply personal thing to many trans people and this film explores the unique ways trans people experience their bodies in modern society; the liberation of stepping outside of those molds and the liberation of fitting within them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fICjKtWGSFu24KQl6JB92HYSajr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Formless","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
