Amidst the foundational anti-Blackness of America, Saint Leroi posits Blackness as arbiter of justice and punisher of wrongs, thus challenging ideas of who is allowed judgment, vengeance, rapture, and rebirth. Whiteness has been taught that it created and owns everything, but Blackness knows it has the right to possess and inhabit every story, every sovereignty, every creation myth, every destruction, every history, present, and future imaginable. A trenchant indictment of the blood-stained hands of all those—past and present—who know what they’ve done, Saint Leroi is ultimately an expression of belonging, grief, and love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saint Leroi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
