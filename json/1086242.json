This one-off screening event celebrates the fans and their cameras, as much as the band itself — a collision/collusion of the ephemeral moment on stage, and the moments captured on camera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nPfBj6W4q0tD9Vnd1wfTTuzYEvJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"\"We Are Fugazi From Washington, DC\"","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
