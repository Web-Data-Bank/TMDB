It combines live action with hand-drawn animated mattes to create an abstract, sometimes disturbing portrait of a woman. Images break apart randomly and come back together. Nothing is ever completely revealed. This is a highly manipulated, non-linear, non-narrative piece. It does not tell a story, but it does create a feeling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gcFUzmY56ezyvi9ZNkCIxCPsiR1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frequent Seas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
