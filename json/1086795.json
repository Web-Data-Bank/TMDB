An open call audition in New York City delivers a cast of up-and-coming Broadway performers, including Aster, a talented newcomer who seems to be perfect for the lead role.  Rehearsals begin and Aster soon realizes she may be in over her head. Even with help from her cast mates including Danica, the ultimate triple threat, and Corey, her love interest in the show (and maybe outside of it too), Aster cant seem to make Rodney happy. Things only get worse as the show loses investors, the sets and costumes are trapped on a boat, and Aster accidentally pushes Corey off the stage.","popularity":2.64,"poster_path":"/fyl4UA5Uz6FLzOTPCgk3AU0m39S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Starring Now United","title":"The Musical: Welcome To The Night Of Your Life!","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
