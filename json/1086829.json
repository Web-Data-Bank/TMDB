The line-up features original Mayhem vocalist Maniac, plus Hellhammer on drums, Necrobutcher on bass & Blasphemer on guitar. The show also features a guest appearance by now-current Mayhem vocalist Attila Csihar on the track ‘From the Dark Past’.  With a crystal clear sound & the noticeably stunning drum work of Hellhammer, the band themselves considered this worthy of being labelled an official release, as Mayhem storm through a strong set full of classics from old releases ‘Deathcrush’ & ‘De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas’, to the post-Euronymous compositions as featured on ‘Wolf’s Lair Abyss’. Expect nothing but dark & chaotic black metal carnage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/LZLM51nRCmjbweFo6m9bgDBnAa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A SAVAGE SET OF BLACK METAL CLASSICS FROM THE NORWEGIAN LEGENDS CAPTURED IN 1998.","title":"Mayhem: Mediolanum Capta Est","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
