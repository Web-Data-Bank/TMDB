According to the Ainu's traditional beliefs, animals are \"gods\" called \"Kamuy\" who live in the \"land of gods\" (\"Kamuimosiri\"), but sometimes they come to the \"land of humans\" (\"Ainumosiri\"), to offer their meat and furs as gifts. The Ainu take care of them, and they eventually hold an \"Iomante (spirit sending)\". In this ceremony, people offer prayers, sing songs, and dance, and send the animal back to the \"land of the gods\" with food and souvenirs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rJIfUet8MWO8sVP61lUOOhL8bSX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chironnup Kamuy Iomante","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
