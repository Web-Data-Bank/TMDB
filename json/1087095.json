When a speeding ticket threatens his livelihood and freedom, Mario must take on community service work at Safe Harbor homeless shelter.  While reluctant at first, Mario soon finds his calling in helping others with the encouragement of Olivia McBride (Morgan Graham) and Steven Young (Cornelius Muller).
