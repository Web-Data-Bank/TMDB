Their work and friendship often highlights the intersections of access, community, collective liberation, and healing. The film highlights an impromptu discussion the two had after Man inquired one night:  “Why do people want to be remembered?”  Capturing their analysis on glitchy Google Meet, the viewer is placed in Man’s shoes as he must fully rely on the live captioning without sound to participate in the conversation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Do People Want to Be Remembered?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
