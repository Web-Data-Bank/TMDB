Malek is living on the ground floor of an old building by the sea, single with no family ties. She is frequently mocked by her friends, Khaled and Azza, because of her passions for Roman mosaics and for spying on her strange neighbors. It is the day- to- day life she has chosen. But when night falls, the wild violent rowing she hears from behind her neighbors' closed door plunges her into fits of anguish. Dark memories resurface. She is sure there is a Monster living in her building. It sends her messages, enters her apartment when she is away. The day she met Jih√®ne, a new tenant, who she immediately befriends, was the day the monster came knocking at her door.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aMalatxHBiQvcQLThEu37X7BC0A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bunkoeur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
