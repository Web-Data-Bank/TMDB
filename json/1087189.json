Albina dreamed of becoming a psychoanalyst. Instead, she underwent several episodes of psychosis and psychiatric hospitalizations after her sister Almira experienced psychosis and took her own life. Sisterless is an unsentimental attempt to analyze the work of grief, a feminist commentary on the connection between illness, the contemporary political condition and the consequences of post-Soviet displacement.
