The reason for his return is to take revenge on a former stuntman, Gou Okubo (Masashi Takahashi), who was the cause of his father's accidental death. His aunt Hitomi Natsume (Kimiko Ikegami) tells him where he is and dares him to become a stuntman to make up for the death of his father, but he says nothing and is no longer the man he was when he represented Japan. Akira begins training under former stuntman Hitoshi Todo (Ken Ishiguro), but he is unable to handle a motorcycle, which was his forte. Todo tells him, \"Riding fast without accidents is racing, but car stunts cause spectacular crashes. Live or die. It is an art of thrill. One day, Akira receives a job offer to spin a car into the air and dive into the sea. It was a stunt in which his father was killed in an accident. Then, a situation that brings a sudden change to the world begins to unfold.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nTUbx5bRtajBlAHgadftudqCmT9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolf The Last Stuntman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
