Set in the months following the Brussels bombings of March 2016, and just before the “Brexit” referendum, Chang’s film captures the city of Brussels at a vulnerable moment. Functioning as a portrait of the city, the film shows Brussels’ European institutions, WIELS, lush parks, as well as the various communities that intersect in Chang’s life: her fellow artists, her queer friendship group, and her Roma and Syrian refugee neighbours. Brussels appears as a series of parallel realities, brought together by Chang’s gaze.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mAOkfFyk0oT2l5vD6Nb5ay6kExj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2016-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brussels, 2016","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
