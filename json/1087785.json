The technique mixes three dimensional work, boiling watercolour, thick paint, ink and collage. The mark-making mixes roughness and calligraphic grace. The film tells a dreamlike story of a king who is attracted to the singing of a mysterious woman. He is disappointed when she turns out to have the head and neck of a swan and finds it difficult to fit into her new role as Queen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193567,"logo_path":null,"name":"West Surrey College Of Art And Design","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swan Song","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
