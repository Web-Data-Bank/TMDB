In a fully archival tour de force, co-directors Brian Becker and Marley McDonald document the countdown to Y2K against the backdrop of the mass hysteria that infiltrated everything from politics to pop culture. Doomsday prepper communities started to proliferate and businesses popped up with products, books, and any way to make a quick buck off the looming disaster. Time Bomb Y2K is a wild ride through the final days of the ’90s and a compelling portrait of a turning point in the digital revolution.","popularity":0.86,"poster_path":"/xXT4DLduRPIHFItcPBnfe2uXBSq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":177985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spinning Nancy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Bomb Y2K","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
