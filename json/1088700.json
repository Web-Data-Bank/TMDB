This farmer, however, is too attached to his land and persist in remaining there, despite the difficulties he has to confront. Through his eyes and those of his peers, the trend of Icelandic society away from traditional agriculture towards industrialisation is viewed with sympathetic regret.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kvikmynd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farmer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
