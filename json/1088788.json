In the peaceful valley in which they live, they eat nuts and regurgitate golden nuggets. When the Great Shuddering Nut appeared many years ago, it told the Squeezils to collect as many of the golden rocks as they could in preparation for the Nut's return, and they would be rewarded with amazing treasures. When the Nut returned at last, Fred the pilot finds that one Squeezil has even more valuable items to offer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Squeezils the Movies!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
