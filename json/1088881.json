Evie doesnâ€™t seem to talk very much, though we learn she communicates with everything - the plants, grass, water, TV static and the starlings that gather over the sea. As murmurations form, so awakens a sense of understanding, connection and acceptance between mother and daughter. Murmur is a story of beauty and awe, utilising the stunning spectacle of the murmuration, a sign of greatness, as a metaphor for Autism Advocacy.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/gACK8qttGLM6QqcHIywS2FJoj7W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A contemporary fairytale about the relationship between a mother and her autistic daughter, and their fascination with starling murmurations.","title":"Murmur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
