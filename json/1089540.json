Manon and François, two young city dwellers, have left everything behind to travel the world in search of concrete initiatives that put nature back at the heart of cities. Between the intoxicating green columns of Mexico, the unusual production of mushrooms in dark cellars of Brussels or a fierce Japanese composting technique without odor, they discovered positive and accessible solutions that already work. Along the way, they met these ordinary people with revolutionary ideas. By linking all these solutions, they offer us their visions of what could be the beautiful city of tomorrow.","popularity":2.244,"poster_path":"/tJb81yVSERnOXDYk5UsqnlsgrnY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green City Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
