In 1992, with the Bosnian War raging, thousands of Bosnians sought refuge in America. Chosen because of its affordable housing and available jobs, a large number of those Bosnians ended up in St. Louis, Missouri. Once there, they began assimilating, starting their own businesses, and transforming a once dilapidated neighborhood into a thriving \"Little Bosnia.\" Over the ensuing three decades, an estimated 70,000 Bosnians have migrated to St. Louis, making it the most inhabited area for Bosnians outside of Bosnia itself. A New Home tells the story of these refugees' perseverance and determination to not only start life over but prosper. â€” Joseph Puleo","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z4LkXtTl3pmhuMZbh4YT5p3a7bf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194000,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caleo Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":194001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cavaliere Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A New Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
