His associative universe of sounds and signifiers imagines a present moment suspended between traces of the mythic past and spectres of uncertain futures. Harnessing the live, organic qualities of super 16mm, the film builds a singular, dissonant energy that stalks the outer boundaries of science fiction, horror, and nature documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FEARDEATHLOVEDEATH","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
