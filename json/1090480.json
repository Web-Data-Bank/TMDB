Taking place in the months leading up to an international move from Canada back home to Ireland – a country they had to leave a decade prior due to severe cuts in disability services – the film focuses on her brother’s writings using eye tracking technology and her mother’s memories to explore how we shape a sense of self under the pervasive weight of unspoken assumptions and fixed definitions that get placed onto bodies. Dissecting layers of language, agency and power, the film is a subtle examination of how a human life is measured and valued.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wTn1c7UHCKbdyt6EswDd1QCG8jO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canada Council for the Arts","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":118047,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film London Artists’ Moving Image Network","origin_country":""},{"id":56184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of Ireland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cabbage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
