Influenced by Saidiya Hartman’s concept of “critical fabulation” – the use of storytelling to fill the gaps left in historical records – the film advocates for a bottom-up form of historiography: centring historically marginalised voices of Irish women and critiquing the structures of power that (re)produce their dispossession.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A mother’s love for her baby","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
