In a movement passing from within towards the world, one senses a multiplicity of subjectivities that re-inhabit the large territory of the ancient mine. Há ouro em todo o lado is the first segment of the she-wolf trilogy, a series of films that trace the attribution of an industrial gaze in relation to nature, shaped by a movement towards forms of life that emerge within, despite and against that same context.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There is gold everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
