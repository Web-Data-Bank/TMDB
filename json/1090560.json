Without diagnostic clarity or mental health evaluations, their doctors quickly affirmed them as “transgender,” and mindlessly ushered them along the path of medical transition—the “gender-affirming care” is the only treatment recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. These young people were harmed irrevocably by the doctors they trusted. Affirmation Generation demonstrates how the “one-size-fits-all” medicalization—the “gender-affirming care”—has failed these patients. The stories of the detransitioners are examined by twelve leading experts with decades of clinical practice treating gender-distressed patients in the 90-minute documentary; citing 45 peer-reviewed medical and journalist articles.","popularity":3.173,"poster_path":"/fxZUPnRrzTqWRWzuQaaiMCyJgeo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197861,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panacol Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Lies of Transgender Medicine","title":"Affirmation Generation","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
