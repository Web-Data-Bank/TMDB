The unfinished structure of the Calatrava Veil in the suburb of Rome is the stage where Dino Desica re-calls his experience of joining a neo-fascist teen gang to escape discrimination for being Neapolitan, not yet aware of his evolving queerness. In the film this landscape reflects the imperialistic failures of both ancient Rome and modern-day Fascism. The building structure is abandoned and unguarded. Dinoâ€™s interaction with the skeleton of the building is a marriage of conflict and alliance, a mixture of parody and cynicism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Better a Fascist than a Faggot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
