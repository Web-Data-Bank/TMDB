The transitional state from a dreaming mind to a waking one is slow and tedious. There is a mental blurriness that persists to different degrees when one starts their day. There is a physical parallel between this phenomenon to hiding under a blanket when we do not yet accept the task of getting up in the morning. The translucent fabrics create a haze to shield our vision from the morning sun. This explores cinema's ability to portray the experience of numerous layers of restless blankets acting as a cognitive fog that is gradually being lifted as you finally wake up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z1v8Xd48p2mpdGiiD2gS7DBrSqn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194246,"logo_path":null,"name":"studio reisalte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"blankhead","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
