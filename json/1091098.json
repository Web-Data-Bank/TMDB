As unlucky suitors fail and fall, up steps Calaf, a prince of the Tatar people.  The new, visually stunning version of Puccini’s Turandot at the Finnish National Opera delivers a universal message: regardless of who we are or where we come from, we are all looking for love. Director Sofia Jupither sets out to focus on the essence of Puccini’s interest in private and the public lives, power and responsibility, love and vulnerability. Puccini composed the opera in the heyday of exoticism and orientalism; an Europe-centric view of the Far East is in danger of distancing modern audiences from Puccini’s masterpiece.","popularity":0.625,"poster_path":"/5ODgBGxlExvVoWam7ykeq1UJROE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turandot - FNO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
