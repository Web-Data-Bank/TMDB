In evoking his life, it paints a portrait of the 20th century: the scientism of the Sorbonne, the rise of Nazism, the Resistance, Free France, Christian Democracy in South America, but also art, freedom, peace and love for the human person.  Jacques Maritain, in the torments of the 20th century, of it's murderous madness and it's hope for peace, holds a secret: his ineffable and faithful love for his wife Raïssa, the inspiration for his political commitments and his philosophical thought.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ucFMLazUqnX2JcXuCgdXsmG50cp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ana Films","origin_country":""},{"id":183510,"logo_path":"/jZGOExPfpUe6vLVU9vaYB0eD7XL.png","name":"KTO TV","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jacques Maritain, le philosophe amoureux","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
