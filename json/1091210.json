Here the former Soviet Union once made its vast arsenal of chemical weapons and industrial chemicals. Today, a quarter of the city's 300,000 residents are still employed in the factories, turning out toxic chemicals. On the population, the pollution is taking its toll: life expectancy is 42-47, the death rate is 2.6 times higher than the birth rate, and the men are close to impotence. In-depth interviews with the inhabitants of Dzerzhinsk give a revealing insight into what life is really like for the beleaguered populace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russia: Poison City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
