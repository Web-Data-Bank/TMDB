Emerging from abstract geometric landscapes, we lock in on a boy with his father embracing in the middle of a rainy forest. Soon they are descending to the bottom of a lake to discover a hidden city. There, the boy enters a door and finds himself walking through his father’s memories, or maybe it’s his own future, or somehow both.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9OlPsycNsd0yjZsL7iLQ45mzbQP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
