The evangelical movement is convinced that they will be saved when Jesus appears in the state of Israel on horseback and, with a sword raised to heaven, kills the infidels so that the blood reaches the horses’ bridles. Natural fires, corona, wars and crises are evidence that the time is nigh. But for the prophecies to be realized, the state of Israel has to grow stronger, so they provide huge financial support and are so far inside the White House that they help influence US foreign policy.","popularity":1.257,"poster_path":"/31VWNr0ZQykkYJ62QlBhjBCCgp7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101445,"logo_path":"/todlum7lWU4ZZU7iAiElZkcrGTw.png","name":"UpNorth Film","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":17518,"logo_path":"/1gPGo3B6BAFYSRQ3X6NumB3nGMU.png","name":"Auto Images","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":5974,"logo_path":"/vgPUbUDwVGL1ruiPv2KFtjh75UD.png","name":"Making Movies","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":57317,"logo_path":"/3vol4eJ6YPMULoVJrLvixfdbyVe.png","name":"Ventana Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":12477,"logo_path":"/tuREvnCzrM5sNXyrKRFCyB1gHF8.png","name":"Film i Skåne","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":62165,"logo_path":"/9i15HMPXjW657H4BnrMkeQcbktL.png","name":"Al Jazeera","origin_country":"QA"},{"id":107563,"logo_path":"/x42HkwWO4sOYSekXbl3LKxRz2Wo.png","name":"EO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2023-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When biblical prophecy fuels political power","title":"Praying for Armageddon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
