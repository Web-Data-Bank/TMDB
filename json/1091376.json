When neglected girlfriend, Christy leaves him, he's to question what \"the good life\" is without having someone to share it with. But, when Samson meets Delilah (Jessica Drake), a stunning hairdresser, the attraction is immediate. Like him, Delilah is headstrong, ambitious and, most importantly, drop dead gorgeous. Amidst repeated warnings from his mother and friends, Samson quickly falls for Delilah and, just as quickly . . . loses it all.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/e5pNUoL6FxavzfRy01L2mpdoZSH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/pXHXO1qKuQEDv8NDvoNmSaV4gvi.png","name":"Wicked Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"she cuts deep.","title":"Delilah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
