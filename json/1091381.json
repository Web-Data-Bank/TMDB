In three separate chapters, Katia Kameli delivers a reflection on the making of images or symbols (the flag!). In the enlightened company of the philosopher Marie-José Mondzain and extracts from films by Assia Djebar, she begins a critique that goes beyond the Algerian framework on our relationship to the stories, ideologies and images that shape them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vCTsyHlwF5B82SwxRadappvVeKo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Algerian Novel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
