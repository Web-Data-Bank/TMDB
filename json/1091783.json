At school, Dot is treated so cruelly that she runs away, but a kind farmer takes her to the police station and she is returned to her parents. When Dot's father becomes involved in a scheme to smuggle arms into Mexico, Dot's photograph prevents newspaper owner Robert Chase from exposing him. Repentant, Dot's parents finally give her the love she had so sorely missed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Children Wanted","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
