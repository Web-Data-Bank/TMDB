As we follow the drivers' journey, we see how democracy is not easy, especially for a group of independent contractor drivers who must learn to trust each other and work as a team. After Uber and Lyft force a citywide referendum vote in protest of regulations, we see the drivers join a shoestring campaign to fight the technology giants. We witness how workers must constantly advocate for themselves through political organizing. Ultimately, this film serves as a cautionary tale for workers and labor organizers about the tenuous nature of democracy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Driver, One Mic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
