She meets Uli on the way to Baguio through an old push-to-talk phone and they become friends. As their friendship turns into love, they face the complication that Uli seems to be from the past. However, they discover that their love has been experienced before but forgotten. The story is revealed to be Ikay's unfinished script, read by Eulogio to her while she's in a coma after a fatal accident. Love You Long Time suggests that real love takes time, not just fleeting moments.","popularity":1.666,"poster_path":"/nkGG4ovQAOmoWHBJ3aOyCAXz6Cz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Three Sixty","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love You Long Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
