The film focuses on forceful campaigns against these nations' economic interests, launched worldwide by international protest groups, such as Greenpeace. It is the traditional utilization of marine mammals, whales and seals, that is opposed bitterly by the protest groups, who usually claim that the hunting methods are inhumane or that the whale stocks face extinction-claims which are rejected outright by scientists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":194446,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magned Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1989-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Survival in the High North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
