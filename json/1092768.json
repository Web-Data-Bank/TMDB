It may well have been the inspiration to Tolkien as he visited. Iceland before he started drawing the outlines of the famous Ring Trilogy. Thorsmork can only be reached with difficulty, hidden away between glaciers and trecherous rivers, but is still one of the most popular places in the country to visit. The film about Thorsmörk shows it’s beauty and lure. From bird’s eye view you will experience an overall impression of a magical landscape; where the deep green of lush plants meets the blackness of the wide sands lined with silvery bands of untamed rivers flowing through it.

Thorsmörk’s flora, fauna and geography is explained by a narrator, guiding the viewer through the magical landscape of one of nature’s unforgetteble beauty spots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ediU18PAfaUWk0IfxCuCG7yl3o5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lífsmynd Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Þórsmörk - The Hidden Walley of Thor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
