This hunt is very dangerous as the men have to operate from narrow ledges in cliffs high above the surfing ocean.  In August we see another side of the puffin/man relationship, as the children lovingly collect helpless puffin chicks from streets and alleys and keep them in cardboard boxes at their homes for the night until the can help them to the sea in the morning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193776,"logo_path":null,"name":"KVIK Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1997-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Brother in the North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
