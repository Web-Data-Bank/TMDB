We gain an insight into an inner and outer world, where manual labour, man's beliefs in nature, Christianity, superstition and even magic are interwoven.  We are questioned if we could imagine how this world of the rowing boat crew, wich reflects the ancient class-divided society, really looked like? How did they percive the nature around them, their God in this nature, it's unstable weather conditions, it's harshness when they go to sea to harvest its riches to make it possible for themselves as well as their nation to keep on living on the edge of the habitable world? Here we are face to face with the very foundation of fishing nation's culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w9sNtRWJqcrjtCRcL5DPvyT2hfe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kvikmyndaverstöðin ehf.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give Us This Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
