This is an important chapter in Reykjavik history and for the national as whole. The Icelandic community turned from the farm life to a urban city in a very short period of time and these barrack communities were an example about this tremendous growth in the city. Here we see the barracks put in a perspective as a historic event that depicts the various livelihood of people in the growing city. We follow people that actually lived in these barracks and hear what they have to say and experienced in these times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fwRH5PxQcKuS5lgMITReHnKR2kR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Braggabúar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
