Thorgeir Thorgeirson - a recipient of the honorary Edda (Award of The Icelandic Film Academy) \"for his contribution to film production and general film culture in Iceland\" comments on trends and tendencies of the local film industry, from the so called pioneers - as the first semi professional amateurs generously have been named - up to the more recent production of feature films. With professional skill and a clear dissident's mind Torgeirson is able not only to analyze Icelandic film history but also to sketch up a friendly-ironical picture of the “dress up society\" in general.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3ttTQhAlGmeoM1zVSvb2HbTAeQz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leshús","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2002-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discourse on Films","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
