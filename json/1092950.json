He teams up with Cory Richards, a National Geographic photographer and the first American to climb an 8,000-meter peak in winter, and they attempt a never-before-tried climb on the north face of Everest.  Though they fail on their first attempt, they vow to return the following season. However, due to the global pandemic, the North side of Everest remains closed, so the ambitious duo turns their attention to a futuristic new route on Dhaulagiri, the seventh highest mountain in the world.  When the risk of death on Dhaulagiri stresses the team to a breaking point, the climbers are forced to confront the question of why they climb—and why it’s all worth it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Wtd48MqpcOwazbRPqN5Rxxcy7q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Ecuadorian mountaineer balances friendship, love, and luck in his quest to climb a new route on one of the tallest and most dangerous mountains in the world.","title":"Dhaulagiri","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
