The plan begins to come apart when Achilles, incapable of subduing his virility, falls in love with Princess Deidamia.  Disguise and transvestism have been an essential part of opera plots from the Venetian origins of the genre. In line with this tradition, the story of Achilles on the Island of Scyros inspired more than 30 compositions for voice based on Metastasioâ€™s libretto of 1737. The Italian composer Francesco Corselli was a key figure in Spanish opera of the 18th century. As Kapellmeister of the Royal Chapel of Madrid for nearly 30 years, he was the principal supplier of opera to the Spanish court. Some of these were under the artistic direction of the famous castrato Farinelli.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rFBv19aox4SJpfcuTwuPPJls8tm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Achille in Sciro - CORSELLI","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
