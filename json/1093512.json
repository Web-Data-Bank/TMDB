Three couples, including porn stars JASON and TINA RUSSELL, as well as adult filmmaker WARREN EVANS, demonstrate masturbation (female only), kissing, caressing, cunnilingus and, finally, fellatio.  As these sexual acts are demonstrated, \"Dr. Norma Jacobs\" of \"The Gould Institute\" and an unseen male narrator offer medical and sociological observations on the subjects of sex and sensuality. \"The mouth is one of the prime erogenous zones,\" suggests the amply-lipped Dr. Jacobs, while the man observes that, \"No greater love for his woman can be shown as by kissing all the various parts of the female form.\" As might be guessed, the filmmakers focus on certain parts more than others.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/x7E8L4LpfIcRJfVsSNP6OgoCSeb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
