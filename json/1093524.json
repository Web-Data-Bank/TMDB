Just don't let that thing find me...no matter what...absolutely not. Nakajima Shiori is running away from the mysterious man. She escapes to a logistics warehouse. She is saved by Mai Yazaki, who was working there, and the two decide to work together. Tormented by the shadow of the man creeping up on her, Nakajima begins to talk about her mother's murder. Inorganic objects such as cars, stairs, smartphones, and CRT televisions loom over them. The hidden things are revealed, and the strings are strung together. I want to escape, but I can't.
