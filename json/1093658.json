They decided to do something about it. In a climate of continuous repression they were able to express artistic freedom in ways which no one would have deemed possible. Clandestine exhibitions, illegal rock-concerts and excessive partying was part of the programme. A clique around singer Jan Sputnik formed a punk-rock band called Democratic Consumption, as a way to earn money. They toured around Germany, performing shows and partied each day like it was their last.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hGP7kR6i4RMzl0DHQY0zvmgXGZw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1410,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAG/TRAUM Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2004-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schräge Zeit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
