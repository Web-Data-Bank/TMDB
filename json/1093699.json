In the bathroom, the clay figure faces the mirror and strikes various poses in a very narcissistic way, imagining himself in multiple roles: a beautiful girl with an S figure, a high-profile actress, or a high-ranking politician. ...... The images in the mirror present our different desires, perhaps some are real ideals, some are satanic fantasies, and some are just whimsical. Some may be true ideals, some are satanic fantasies, some are just a flash of whimsy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iPfR9g26MDwIlmJE3PQw9ktCjpF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirror Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
