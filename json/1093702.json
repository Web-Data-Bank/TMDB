Director Thorfinnur Gudnason and his team bring to life a dramatic tale with sharply defined characters – all of them horses. Stretching the limits of the nature documentary has been Gudnason´s forte and his earlier film, Woodmouse: Life of the Run, has been shown around the world. Here he takes us into the world of horses running wild in the stark but majestic highlands of Iceland. Without humanising the animals in any way, the film tells a story full of drama and emotion, character, danger, and resolve.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lqn5M2S5yLO9191px9vHkUy2u2F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running With the Herd","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
