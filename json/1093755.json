It’s apparent that this day is overshadowed by a spectre from her past which she increasingly cannot deny. Her older brother Adam — an equally solitary workaholic — arrives with a cake and a gift card for a routine birthday visit between meetings. But what starts as a perfunctory drop-in becomes a turning point in their lives, as Ruth lays her cards out on the table and sparks a confrontation about the defining event which broke their family and their attempts to come to terms with it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yNP6M0v7SDg6aNql2jhAYjPp4hn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
