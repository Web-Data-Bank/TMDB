It’s also a film about faces, closeness, and intimacy, and how a Super 8 camera allowed her to get closer to the people she was portraying while also keeping a protective distance.  This film was part of a project commissioned by the Echo Park Film Center for the 20th anniversary of its location in LA. The project was supported by the Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts. Making Space was shot in 2021, entirely on KODAK TRI-X Reversal Film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":131824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Echo Park Film Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-16","revenue":100,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What happens when home isn’t the answer anymore?","title":"Making Space","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
