Many humorous questions and interesting topics arise when the Icelandic nation is examined through the eye of the foreigner: Do foreigners think of Reykjavík as Bangkok of the north? Are the Icelanders an isolated and inbred nation? Or rather special and like no other? Is Icelandic inventiveness fit for export? Is the \"pure and unspoiled\" nation itself environmentally friendly?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/puYp9OjwbFXExnN6hteec0lWccc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Do You Like Iceland?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
