Industrialisation had really just begun and the country was taking it’s first steps towards the ultra-modern society we know today. The US military set up a base next to the sleepy fishing village of Keflavik on the south coast turning everything on it’s head. The Americans outnumbered the locals three to one. Culturally it was as if a UFO had landed. The young people were more open to cultural influences than the older generation and this triggered a rock and roll explosion which then swept the rest of the country. It was the birth of Icelandic teenage culture. Because of Iceland’s location right between America and Europe the cultural influences mixed to produce an unique blend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pzXBnBf5nZuZFdSK8kQmGIAfhC5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liverpool of the North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
