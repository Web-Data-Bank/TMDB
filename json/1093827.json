Edison was born and raised in Nottingham, England. When he was fourteen years old he began to practice Buddhism. Eighteen years old he became a monk and went to Thailand where, for a decade, he spent his time in monasteries around the country. He became the first Buddhist monk in Iceland when he moved here in 1994 and founded a Buddhist sect. Five years later Robert decided to \"derobe\" and get married. After sixteen years of celibacy Robert had to deal with being \"normal\" - getting employment, paying his bills and dealing with the needs of his partner. After four years in \"the real world\" Robert travelled back to Thailand to become a monk again. Act Normal is filmed from 1994 to 2006 and is a unique exploration of one manÂ´s twelve-year search for some kind of love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/djlCMXCVQ4vUacMKdrrcEUnSZTh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Act Normal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
