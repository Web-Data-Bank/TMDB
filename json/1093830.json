In the mid-1970s, Christa Leem reinvented an art form. Before, many other artists had taken off their clothes and, in the throes of Franco's regime, other vedettes, actresses, singers, celebrities and aspirants jumped the repressive fence of national Catholicism and showed to the joy of the repressed citizenry the forbidden fruit. But Christa showed us her naked, white, light and premature body to discover us much more: a transparent and free soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cRhv5yL1GpVAOLDabzOuWQwKhFZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The shirt of Christa Leem","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
