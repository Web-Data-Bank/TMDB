The time is the 1930s. Conflicts between neighboring towns over local resources has sent simmering tensions in the scenic Columbian countryside boiling over into outright violence. Amidst this chaos, Franciscan monk Felipe finds himself torn between the woman he loves, and his true calling in the clergy. When a young girl is found dead and his best friend is accused of murder, faith intercedes and Felipe offers to the authorities in place of the man he knows could not have committed such a crime. Should the man be sentenced to execution, however, Felipe will suffer the ultimate consequence for a crime he didn't commit. Of course there's still time for love to triumph, but whether it's powerful enough to offer redemption and salvation remains to be seen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Qc92KnrjLtzQC5ng4jzKKaEsPd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Milagro en La Tierra del Cafe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
