The roles and economics of education change: 32 children teach one adult learner.  But during this role reversal, the focus is not on the symmetrical transfer of power, but on the establishment of a situation of fragility for all parties. It is about establishing a space where no one knows. This documentary pays attention to the moments when we name something for the first time; to the thinking behind the language; to the intrinsic politics in learning processes; to collaborative teaching methods; to misunderstandings as spaces of opportunity; to the relationship with someone who comes from another world; a kind of alien who lands in the school.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nKhbvdCgj8PeVy9wpgBNHGUR0ux.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria va a la escuela","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
