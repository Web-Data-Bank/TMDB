Individual males (more wingbeats per second, higher frequency) and females (slower, lower) adjust their flight tones until a pleasing harmony is achieved. These boys have found a pitch irresistible to one sex—hopefully females, for malaria is growing in the DRC, and only pregnant females bite. Eros and Thanatos for the mosquitoes; for the boys, a small but satisfying cull of the horrible hordes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3XL9KVq3UEbsTX2m3wsCo3U7Yp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"2021-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #30: Imbu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
