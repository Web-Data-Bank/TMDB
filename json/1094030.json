They don't miss a match for the national team or the teams they support. In addition, every late afternoon, when the sun is already milder, they meet at the different soccer fields scattered around the village, to hit a ball.  The fishermen of Ajuruteua take their passion for the national sport so seriously that they always embark with a ball placed on the bow of the boat. When they can, they find their fishing partners on the croas, as the sandbanks in that region are called, for a pelada. There, at low tide, they play football on this ephemeral field, created by nature, before returning to the open sea and facing the challenges of yet another fishing trip.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5IcotiF1Ku33XdK1WxVZV8PAD2s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Time da Croa - A Copa Passou por Aqui","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
