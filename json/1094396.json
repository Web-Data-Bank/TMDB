Meredith, a lowly cop trying to make detective gets her chance when a prisoner turns up dead - and her captain is the most likely suspect. The road that leads to the truth can often be a sleazy one, and Meredith isn't afraid to use her weapon or get her uniform dirty if it means getting to the bottom of things - or things getting into her bottom, whichever comes first! Nope, crime doesn't pay and justice must be served, but that doesn't have a damn thing to do with the incredibly raunchy action that goes down when Meredith goes undercover - and only comes up for air! Just the facts, ma'am!","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/yMKsoq5zIDuVvMFJ4tZBHPCab4B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5097,"logo_path":"/cjK2zkmtR2DxHcwqRCXr5SpsLSa.png","name":"VCA Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story About Cops Who Blow First and Ask Questions Later.","title":"To Protect and Service","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
