Hope springs eternal but here hope is a struggle with oneself and with despair.  The boys tell their story from within, the story of how the light pushes the darkness out of the way, without self-pity or evasion. They have exhausted every venue. Therefore the true facts stand naked. Marvelous people. Fascinating characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Win a Lost Game","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
