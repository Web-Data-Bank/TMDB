Against the busy backdrop of their art practice, we sit in on their quiet rural life, which, in its proximity to nature and the vast green and oceanic spaces that surround, echoes the romanticism of a simpler time.  As the decaying world of physical labour and the mechanical industry faces up to an expanding digital empire, Jon gradually retreats into the alternative realities of his own design.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f9D9cHwpzmSui69P7Kk38GzHc2u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about games, alternative realities, and rural Nova Scotia.","title":"Plains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
