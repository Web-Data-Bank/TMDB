The two women - art collector Mary-Leigh Smart and artist Beverly Hallam - were exacting about their specifications for the house, and they lived there together for over forty years. In \"To be Sound is to be Solid,\" the filmmakers venture to decipher the house's opaque queer history by studying its complicated and circuitous floor plan.  \"To be Sound is to be Solid\" is a film of layered intimacies and vicarious encounters. By investigating indefinability, erasure, and transparency in queer archives and scientific research, the film builds connections between lesbian, architectural, and environmental histories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u3jK69KnqYuxFJ7DQxWbyDMMIvT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Be Sound is to Be Solid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
