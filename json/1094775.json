Kō-Fū translates as “Shining Breeze” and refers to “a scene of rice fields just after a typhoon has gone, when it is still windy and the leaves of rice are waving in the stream of wind with raindrops which are shining by reflecting the sunlight.\" The repetitive, flickering images and minimalist music create a psychedelic trip effect in this film, which is made up of short, high-contrast black-and-white footage processed through precise frame-by-frame optical processing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fAM90Vv59v73wtt1caUd1U3xoad.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shining Breeze","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
