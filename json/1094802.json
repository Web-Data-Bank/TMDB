They have known each other for many years and have already worked together. Stomu has been to Iceland to take part in Sverrir’s premieres. During Sverrir’s tour of 15 Japanese cities in December 2005, the two artists spent a lot of time together in Kyoto and discussed creating a new project that would permit their sensibilities to meet.  The aim of this film is to give us an insight into this artistic friendship. The two artists create a musical project especially for our film in which Stomu’s mineral sounds encounters Sverrir’s unique voice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking on Sound","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
