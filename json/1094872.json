The village, which was founded in 1997, was once a successful urban farming community. However, the situation has changed. The gardens have already been demolished, the houses are now in ruins.  In recent years, the construction of the Jakarta International Stadium has been accompanied by the gradual departure of the residents of Kampung Kebun Bayam. This film was made together with the residents of Kampung Kebun Bayam, recording the situations of their final days, including humorous and heartwarming things.  Buildings can be razed to the ground, but the feeling of community, collective memory, and friendship that has existed for years make them forever be the residents of Kampung Kebun Bayam.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xYno3fVLUtFmSqNiopaqWriI70s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hore Besok Libur!","origin_country":""},{"id":129062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemora Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":170046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kumparan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Selamanya Warga Kampung Kebun Bayam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
