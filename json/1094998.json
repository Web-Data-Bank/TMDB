He carefully places his forehead on the beak, nose or forehead of an animal. Will it allow this? Ilegems has no idea. He does not want to force the animal, so he first tries to establish a relationship of trust. In the endearing short film, you see how he allows himself to be comforted by an ostrich, rubs noses with an alpaca and tries to avoid the horns of a bull.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7rFWY88UDZ6K1DrMLq7c66LBk7v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2023-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head to Head","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
