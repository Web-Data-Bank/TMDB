As in the first self-portrait, this resulted in extreme close-ups, in this case of me as I get out of bed. As in the first one, the scene is intercut with images of various administrative documents: identity cards, school IDs, a blood type card... that are in my name - the only colorful elements in this rather grainy black and white film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-portrait nº2 (Réveil)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
