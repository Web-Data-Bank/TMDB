The visual composition was made by meticulously cutting, shaping and collaging flowers onto the filmstrip. The sound treatment is created by pasting e.e. cummings’ poem “somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond,” the letters themselves forming the audio as their graphic shape is translated into sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"finger petals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
