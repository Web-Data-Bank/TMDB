From Ramana Maharshi's direct method of self-enquiry to H.W.L Poonjaji's assertion that we are free here and now and the sharp and provocative teaching style of Nisargadatta Maharaj, this profoundly absorbing documentary is a rare visual treat for viewers.  Interweaving precious archive footage, a deeply inspiring narrative and heartfelt interviews with devotees, this beautifully presented film features, amongst others, acclaimed author David Godman and S K Mullarpattan, respected translator to Nisargadatta Maharaj.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jl4nz0goPpBGCLyqNIuPDyog0dR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who Am I?","title":"Who Am I?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
