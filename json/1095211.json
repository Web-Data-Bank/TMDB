In addition, he is said not being able to control his temper, to have isolated himself from his flock and because of his oddness and idiosyncrasies his sanity has also been questioned.  Is Reverend Jón an incompetent priest? If so, why isn’t he allowed to stay at his farm? Is it because he underfeeds his sheep? Or is it because members of the congregation want to get their hands on his eider down farm for themselves? Or is it simply his appearance, contradicting the accepted notions of what a pastor should be, that has triggered the hostilities towards him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/32xEZUrtZ89OU59TftyNkUN9sZD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John and Reverend John","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
