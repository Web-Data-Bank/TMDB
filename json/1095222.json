And why is that? Birth of an island explores how Iceland was created through volcanic eruptions on the Mid-Atlantic submarine ridge, why they continue and what effects they have on the island today. Why there are geysers and how the Icelanders learned how to harness the power of the natural hot water from deep below, as well as that of glacial rivers. It also shows how natural forces, such as glaciers, rivers, waterfalls, the Atlantic ocean and volcanoes constantly sculpture and mold the island. Explains why the island lost most of its vegetation, so Iceland is now the only country in Europe that has deserts. Also, what measures Icelanders have taken to recover the island´s woodlands.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/seBZcTpxyazPOFKMFVe53kit3Po.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birth of an Island - The Making of Iceland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
