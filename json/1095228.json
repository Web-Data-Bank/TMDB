Interwoven with the story of the amazing endurance of these two men, is the history of swimming in Iceland and in particular the long and hard struggle to re-introduce the skill after it had been almost totally lost to this seafaring nation. By the 19th century it is reckoned that in the whole of Iceland no more than 6 individuals of a population of 50.000, knew how to swim.  With references to the ancient Icelandic sages, we learn through staged scenes how a local hero took on and defeated the Norwegian kin in a bout of the popular Viking sport of sea wrestling and how a mother fled after her husband was viciously killed, swimming to land with her two children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/um6RTUYWaU7zF7xkLQrnuYUNIVc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swim for your life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
