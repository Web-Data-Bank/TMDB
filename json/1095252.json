The story begins in 1939 in Reykjavik, Iceland, where we are introduced to Ludvik and Arnbjorg. We learn how their youthful love evolved into a life-long devotion, and how they stayed together for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health. We learn about their values and their sensibilities about life, and what made them stick.?? Many of us know how it feels to be young and in love. Few can be so lucky to experience that love for 74 years. How could a love like that end? What next? We get to know the hearts of this couple, through thick and thin, through life and into the ever after. We learn about love's eternal worth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7hXpyx6p5TWDD7oehXhzCjEAfMl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holding Hands for 74 Years","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
