Rieko wishes to draw cartoons and comics that make people happy, and doodles comics of Bomberman and friends in her notebooks. An earthquake strikes during the night and ravages the city, leaving their neighbourhood a shambles. They travel to a shelter, but their parents' inability to hear and speak causes misunderstandings and conflict among the workers; Rieko helps resolve the situation while also keeping an eye on her younger sister. With support from volunteer worker Kyoko, an older girl from Tokyo, the community within the shelter begin to grow and understand one another. Rieko helps keep the younger ones amused with her drawings of Bomberman characters, including a comic of the heroes and villains putting their differences aside to help each other when the battle arena comes down on top of them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mjNRlzv7zsnRtpH4scM4n6hFOT9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bomberman: Yuuki o Arigatou Watashi ga Mimi ni Naru","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
