He filmed the ever-larger protests that in the end led to the downfall of the government. He took interviews with people shocked and confused by what was going on around them. He went to conferences and seminars where scholars tired to work out what had happened and what should happen next. He followed the endless debates and negotiations around the Icesave-accounts set up by Icelandic banks abroad. Every day brought fresh news of the complicated and often illegal deals made by financiers and bankers in the years leading up to the collapse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4oOJdWzEnHpHxn6hIpK3j3OjKJd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poor Iceland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
