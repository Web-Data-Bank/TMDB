Clare cracked under the increasing strain of poverty and neglect, and spent the last 23 years of his life in Northampton General Lunatic Asylum. He imagined himself to be Lord Byron, a bigamist, and a prize-fighter; but the poems of his madness are perhaps the most remarkable he ever wrote.  \"Clare's asylum foretells our need for an asylum, his deprivation foretells our deprivation\" (Geoffrey Grigson)  Commentary spoken by Tony Church  (from BBC Midlands)  (David Jones and Patrick Stewart are members of the Royal Shakespeare Company; Tony Church appears by permission of the Northcott Theatre, Exeter)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Clare: \"I Am\"","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
