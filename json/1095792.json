Innocent play in snow soon changes into a true competition where only the best can win. Adults get involved in the rivalry between children forcing them to continue gruelling efforts. The sound of a ticking stopwatch is a perfect complement to the story. At the end of the film, one of the boys rebels and leaves the run. He is not interested in the world of adults yet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hivh0wYvHUzlVqY8fpYnIu0Uf1x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Olympics","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
