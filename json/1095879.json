There grows a magical tree, ever growing and moving. With no man-made creations in sight, the world around The Tree is pure Nature. Our footsteps take us to a fun encounter with Silili. Our ears receive and perceive her sometimes cryptic words. Our eyes are filled with wonder and colours in this engaging reality. Our hands reach out to delightful things and phenomena summoned by Silili’s mighty power. Every little reaction and every little movement of ours will bring about different outcomes. A time to experience, a time to test, a time to discern, a time to end. ‘Master Silili’ will guide us through all these. The rest is down to us - in the face of precariousness, let us feel our way towards insight and spiritual gain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silili & Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
