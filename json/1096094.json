Centered on the story of the legendary Goat Man - a nomadic figure who spent most of his life walking the roads of Georgia with a wagon pulled by a herd of goats - this experimental documentary weaves together an interview with a goat farmer, footage of the daily rituals Johnson enacted with her own herd, and a poem about the Goat Man’s experimental and spectacular life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ybbKObrim4rqc9M8rGXPhkxPBPO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If it Won’t Hold Water, it Surely Won’t Hold a Goat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
