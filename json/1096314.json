Nayzor, in turn, releases Zen-Aku, a wolf-like mechanical beast who has been imprisoned for 3,000 years, and Zen-Aku traps Elephant Zord! His own true identity unknown to him, Zen-Aku at times seems to be the Rangers' enemy and at times, a friend. He also commands three Wild Zords of his own. After the Rangers defeat Vacuum Cleaner Org and later, Bus Org, Zen-Aku combines his Dark Wild Zords to form Predazord, which defeats Megazord, and Zen-Aku gains control of Giraffe Zord! As Taylor and Princess Shayla search for clues about Zen-Aku, the strange wolf creature suddenly shows up with Motorcycle Org. Although the Rangers defeat the Org, Zen-Aku gains control of the Bear Crystals, and things look bad for the Rangers. The only sign of hope comes when Zen-Aku remembers parts of his past and he becomes friendlier. Could it be that Zen-Aku was once a friend to the Rangers?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vDJLVe6Hc3nrXiqMEujHlm5vrp0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Power Rangers Wild Force: Curse of the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
