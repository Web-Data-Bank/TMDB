In 1968, under intensive community pressure from Black and Latino communities, the State of New York chose three New York City school districts to become part of an experiment in community-run education. In Ocean Hill-Brownsville, the community board requested the reassignment of several teachers perceived as racists. The request brought the wrath of the United Federation of Teachers, city and state bureaucracies, and ultimately a citywide teacher's strike.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":132780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Newsreel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Community Control (Newsreel #24)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
