The image of an erect dick trying to stay standing.  I understood during the various modifications of this script, that this scene, \"the prologue\", was a movie in itself. And it is this experience that I wish to provide to the audience: the observation of a falling object struggling to stay standing.  This object subjectively represents thousands of symbolisms for our culture, but I leave this symbology to your imagination.","popularity":1.364,"poster_path":"/5y3jf5uIPVnHAjc3eDW7c34QHsX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2023-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"The desire to make this film began with my project THE BRAZILWOOD WOMEN, a film project in development where I want to play with the image of a male body, which is observed as an object and little by little goes moving on to its deconstruction.","title":"Empire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
