National Geographic looks at the events before, during, and after, including the late warnings that largely went unheard and the dramatic stories of the survivors, many of whom braved terrible floods or deep snow before help could arrive. Most were expecting only more unseasonable warmth--the hurricane winds, massive thunderstorms, and fierce blizzards knocked out power and caught nearly everyone off guard. In addition to interviews with meteorologists who had to puzzle together the bizarre reports from their computers, you'll see footage from Florida to Maine documenting nature's savagery, and follow a group of students hiking in North Carolina's Blue Ridge mountains who were rescued from four feet of snow, as well as others who weren't so lucky. You will never again be complacent about the weather report after watching Storm of the Century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vh2B1syFrkaCPug3wqRUTkBxn5D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic's Storm of the Century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
