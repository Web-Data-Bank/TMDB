The seagull follows the rhythm of man â€“ it has become dependent on the fish waste that the fisherman leaves behind during the week, and on the weekends, when the fisherman is watching football, hunger threatens. Seagulls Scream on the Weekend provides an insight into the intertwined rhythms of the Wadden Sea region, and examines the relationship between boat, man and seagull.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seagulls Scream on the Weekend","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
