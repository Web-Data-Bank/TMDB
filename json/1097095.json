Working from small skiffs, it’s all about locating the bird schools that are feeding on the bait being pushed to the surface by these marauding schools of hungry yellowtail.  The trip is to get on the schools while they’re feeding and with long casts get the bait to them while they're still in a frenzy without spooking them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Abr0yVeujgbR0orlIW8pPVzQkbW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inside Sportfishing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running & Gunning on Yellowtail: Coronado Islands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
