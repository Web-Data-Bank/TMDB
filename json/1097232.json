Directed by Jackie Chan, Chan also stars as Dragon, an up-and-coming gangster in 1930s Hong Kong who rises through the mob ranks by a series of lucky coincidences. Chan attributes his good luck to an old woman, a street vendor who he believes sells lucky roses. When the woman's wealthy daughter comes to visit, Dragon is determined to help the woman impress her daughter. This film was a labor of love for Chan, and his regular collaborators, Bill Tung, Sammo Hung, Anita Mui, and Yuen Biao also make appearances. Although there are bits of action throughout, this sentimental film emphasizes its warm-hearted characters*  * from allmovie.com","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Dragon","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
