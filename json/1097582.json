He comes from a small rural town and is used to living in the quiet countryside. He struggles to form meaningful relationships, and moving to the busy South Korean capital has left him feeling disorientated and confused. The older Jae Won, meanwhile, is now returning to Seoul – and the same university – after completing his mandatory military service. The duo starts to develop a mutual curiosity about one another. But things begin to escalate when Ji Hyun joins the same surfing club that Jae Won attends. Their bond begins to deepen as Ji Hyun discovers a love of surfing and the sea. When the surfing club embarks on a journey, the duo finds themselves together alone – and share kisses. Later, though, Jae Won begins to act as if nothing happened between them. Is this just a fleeting attraction...or the love of a lifetime?","popularity":1.476,"poster_path":"/7K0LZFb7U48tkSgiwFWco1cmJOK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eighth Sense","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
