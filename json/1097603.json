The candy? The costumes? Or visiting some middle-aged guy’s Haunted Garage? Jack-O strongly posits that the last one was a formative part of many childhoods. Sadly, this particular Haunted Garage happens to have offended a scythe-wielding undead killer with a pumpkin head! Maybe he was offended by the oil stains on the garage floor? Or he was distressed by the lack of a tennis ball on a string providing proper parking guidance? We’ll never know!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7gKFq5lFKUKLnOTZBWaIl8eeSJm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15004,"logo_path":null,"name":"RiffTrax, L.L.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RiffTrax: Jack-O","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
