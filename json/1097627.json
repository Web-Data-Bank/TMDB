From reencountering each other with Tzu-chuan unable to recognize Tzu-chi, to the emotional nuances triggered by the subsequent recognition, the story profiles the protagonist’s gender identity, the contempt and even discrimination she faces from her work and social environment, and conflicts with her family. In the story, the protagonist goes through a series of unfortunate incidents with her sister. Long-repressed emotions and pressures finally pop the cap off, but this also becomes an opportunity for Tzu-chuan to resolve her inner conflicts. This film presents the theme “one can only truly move forward in life by newly confronting the obstacles they did not overcome in the past.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n8lgwkckeDtXcyReOHYlleaVIMJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MO","name":"Macao"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2023-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Beautiful Bird Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
