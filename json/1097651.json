They are well aware of the glossy promotional videos that showcase Latvia as a land of happy people and a thriving economy. However, their own observations paint a different picture. They see a country that is not well-organized, and where any effort to improve things is quickly stifled. They notice that many of the people in power seem to be more concerned with playing their daily theatrics than actually working towards bettering the country. Armands and Žaks come to the realization that most of their fellow citizens are either forgetful or masochistic, as they repeatedly vote for these politicians who are not working towards any actual change. Despite this, the two remain hopeful that things will get better as they remind themselves that they are living in Europe, after all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nJh8GAMGBfEZi9j3e48AzXum91U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gailītis-G","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
