After a three-hour performance in front of 200,000 people at Mexico City's historic central square, the Zócalo, the ex-Beatle proved that not only is he as talented as ever, but he is as eternally charming and energetic as one would expect from the former mop-topped demigod.  McCartney amped the crowd at the Zocalo by yelling \"¡Viva Mexico, Cabrones!\" -- a sure fire way to get the crowd up onto their feet -- and made sure to pepper Mexican slang into a few of the songs performed that night. For good measure, Sir Paul also waved the Mexican flag.  During the concert, McCartney was joined by a traditional Mexican mariachi band for the Beatles' classic, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, an evening highlight that will not be forgotten anytime soon by the masses in attendance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pkmLZ5chM3gGm4pjpoPb92KFcVN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4442,"logo_path":null,"name":"MPL Communications","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2012-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Paul McCartney is ON THE RUN","title":"Paul McCartney Live at Zócalo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
