They are carrying out research together for a film, a film to tell the true story of an American priest who went to live in the south of Chile after dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Their efforts take them down many forking paths, to Curepto and Licantén, Queens and Manhattan, Philadelphia and Iowa, through the many neighbourhoods of Santiago. We hear their thoughts in voiceover and see the places they pass by on screen, architectures, landscapes and facades strangely devoid of people, the locations of a film yet to take concrete form.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Veteran","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
