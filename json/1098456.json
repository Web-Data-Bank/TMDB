Audience Precipitation is a brand-new fun, happy and joyful show from 'the outright king of live comedy' (The Times).  Jason has learnt over the past few years that we all need to 'play' a bit more in our lives. With this in mind, Jason will do what he does best: connect with his audience in a way that no other comic can. Expect the Irish funnyman to invite - or drag, as it has been known in the past - people up onto the stage and make a \"holy show of them\", as they'd say in Ireland.  Jason's Audience Precipitation tour will be a laugh-out-loud, must-see show with a light drizzle of audience participation... ooohhh, clever that!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jgP59ZkMP0pC7CNDuzS8Q66TNag.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Up Comedy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jason Byrne: Audience Precipitation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
