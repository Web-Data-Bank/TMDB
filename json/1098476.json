What better way to celebrate than by releasing “Lost & Found Video Night Vol. 19!”? I guess releasing Vol. 20 would make more sense, but for now, Vol. 19 is the best you’re going to get.  Nearly 90 minutes of what you have come to expect from the L&F series, bizarre public access programing, weird movie moments, spectrum crossing music clips, Andy Kaufman, ridiculous commercials, Robocop shooting people in the dick & so much more!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost & Found Video Night Vol. 19","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
