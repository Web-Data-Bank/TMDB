However, over the last few decades Costa Rica restored its forests while providing employment and financial security for its people. How they did it is a story that can inspire the world and show a path to both protecting the ecological wealth and diversity of a nation while providing much needed income and employment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6k84MyETMeBbakinTvXGL8yfRtL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peace with Nature in Costa Rica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
