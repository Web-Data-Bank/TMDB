The historic World March of Women was a bold initiative of the Québec Federation of Women and represented a turning point in global solidarity. Director Sophie Bissonnette invited five filmmakers from around the world to cover the march. She also asked each one to film an innovative project. Set against the backdrop of a song, 'A Score for Women's Voices' ends at the UN, where women deliver 5 million cards signed during the marches. Their goal? To change the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f6ielH5MZq0UjsdIdRGCNxvzklS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les productions virage","origin_country":""},{"id":182669,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Film Board of Canada","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Score for Women's Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
