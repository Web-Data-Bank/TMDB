A place with sand dunes, a raging sea and real wind. It is a place where people stay, but where the sand is constantly shifting, so that an entire lighthouse has to be lifted and moved 70 metres inland to stop it from falling into the sea. A place where the biggest hero is a bricklayer. It’s warm up there, things are kept within budget and you don’t need to sign a contract to have a deal. The man giving the speech is local legend Niels Hausgaard, a singer and storyteller, whose distinct dialect resonates with genuine sincerity. The name of the place is Vendsyssel, and even if you cannot name the zip code, ‘Somewhere by the Sea’ will still take you to a place rarely seen on the big screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vHP0dTwneODOP5hBeFmyDQb3rRW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2023-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A folkloristic tour of the Northwest of Denmark where the sand is blowing, the sea is roaring and the horizon is settling in your mind.","title":"Somewhere by the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
