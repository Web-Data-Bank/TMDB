In a world where women have no legal rights, his play examines a woman who, coming from nothing, has become one of the most wealthy and powerful of executives running an international string of high-class brothels, keeping her life hidden from her daughter. Only when the truth is revealed does the house of cards topple.  In this infamous comedy/drama, George Bernard Shaw brings us his most provocative play, which examines how six people face their past to plan for their future, including the mysterious title character who has built a global empire from the ground up.  Come experience the provocative play that, in its world debut in New York in 1905, the entire cast was arrested on opening night! With a glorious cast by the most amusing and insightful playwright in the English language, the always rascally George Bernard Shaw.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hxRCZ7A3ENDsimNcCDKdHSX6CeX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gingold Theatrical Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. Warren's Profession","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
