It’s a story he knows all too well - Nick reported extensively on sex trafficking of Asian women to Australia a decade ago, blowing open the issue to global audiences. Undercover surveillance suggests that the same notorious players might be back to their old tricks. This raw, gritty observational documentary follows Nick deep into the murky world of brothels, motels, and massage parlours as he attempts to confront the trafficking bosses, hear the stories of survivors, and ultimately compels the government to act on an underreported/ignored crime that is rife on Australia’s shores.","popularity":1.983,"poster_path":"/nZNd8bWOTycDKl8xZMsAj8JTYML.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trafficked","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
