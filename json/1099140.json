Svetlana leaves behind her country and her two children. Hunted by the press, the KGB, and many admirers, the woman, nicknamed the Kremlin princess, will never cease to flee. From the summit of the Soviet empire to the solitude and poverty of her last years in a Wisconsin home, Gabriel Tejedor traces the destiny of a resolutely free woman, at the very heart of the century and its geopolitical challenges. Using archive footage, interviews, and animation, the film gives a voice to Svetlana, whose whole life has been shaped by international dynamics and the decisions of States.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/odgzMTyrut4ymGc6vGwG3ktVkwu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16277,"logo_path":"/wVZrimZweNIYZ0BDRINDZF9W2TJ.png","name":"Akka Films","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":92191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Temps noir","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naître Svetlana Staline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
