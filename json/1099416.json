Forever running into fires without thinking, his luck was bound to run out soon. Not even his headstrong friend Chris, a heroic firefighter in his own right, could keep him from trying to kill himself. But, when Greg selflessly runs into a fire to aid a downed comrade, Evie loses the only man she ever loved.  Now, Evie must rely on friends and the ghost of a love past to heal old wounds and allow herself to see the man that can bring passion back into her life again. Ablaze is the story of a love so strong it transcends the boundaries of life and death. A story of heroism, friendship and timeless all-consuming passion. It's the story of believing that it's okay to want your heart to feel love, even if it means letting go of the past.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/iQRPvPSJtyO45I3z2KUyHHTAemp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sin City","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of timeless endless lust","title":"Ablaze","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
