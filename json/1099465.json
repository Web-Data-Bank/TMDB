Mrs. Anton is extremely worried about her youngest child’s attitude and requests the help of child psychologist, Kak Seto. Lala’s unruly behavior often complicates everything. She even manages to put the relationship between Kak Seto and his girlfriend in jeopardy. Dina, Lala’s sister, admires Kak Seto who can be gentle with children. And when Dina is disappointed with Kak Seto, this triggers Anton Wijaya’s anger. He thinks that Kak Seto wants to ruin his family. Then Bujel, with his devil-may-care unconventional attitude, arrives to bring their problem into focus. This is the point when Lala’s problem can be solved. The film presents a nicely handled child psychology problem while criticising the psychologists at the same time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1981-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
