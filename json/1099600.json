His foe was Tamamo no Mae. She was a bewitching magical fox who deceived the hearts of men. Time passed. Places changed. Now, the decisive day approaches at the splendid, renowned fortress known as the Castle of the White Heron. At times with grace, at times mysteriously, this revue of a Japanese tale depicts the fate of the diviner and the magical fox, in conflict and drawn to each other over the course of reincarnations spanning a millennium.  Outsiders in the Renaissance  While Leonardo da Vinci is celebrated as an all-around genius, there is still much about his life that remains unknown. One theory is that the inspiration for his creations was his love for a woman. This production depicts the affection and hatred between da Vinci and the figures in his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rc1xiKZZM3zBwsvDgTbeU9ENNi8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Castle of the White Heron / Outsiders in the Renaissance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
