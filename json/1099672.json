Nina Ivanoff allowed me to photograph the apartment in Vanves, which had remained as it was since Kojève's death, to admire the many photographs he took until the 1950s and to meet many of his friends. After reading \"The Introduction to Reading Hegel\", this was my first contact with Kojève's reality and since then the desire to make a film has not left me\".
