It’s quiet aside from the wind whistling outside the windows...\r The front door creaks open, as a tenacious Juliet enters, followed by a hesitant Vikki taking in the sudden warmth of the apartment for the first time. They’ve just met tonight, but already a connection has been made. The two couldn’t be more different, yet they both seek the same thing: a lover to keep them warm in the brittle winter of New York. Someone they can trust, someone who will understand them.\r Get comfortable. The night is still young, and Vikki and Juliet still have some shocking things to learn about each other.\r Intimacy is a film about love; it is also a horror film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7EzgkIE3ULL0Obzt52udbBYaiIA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intimacy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
