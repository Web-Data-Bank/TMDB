Resembling two giants crouched over cavernous goals, the competitors take quickfire turns thumbing a marble, careful not to touch anything else. The successful marble shoots in from the side or arcs with precision through the air. For a penalty, it is balanced on top of the defending palisade. Close-ups on fans, rapt faces and dusty feet, bare or in the moulded sandals that protect knees as often as feet. The ring of attention is bisected by a chicken scooting straight through people, the exact centre of the arena, people, and out, as if performing a dare.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8E7oyzlgkBrgon2vehoSbpup6e4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"2021-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #27: Rubi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
