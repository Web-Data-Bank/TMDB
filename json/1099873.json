Four employees would die on the spot. Their descendants today revive the memory of this human tragedy which also struck 42 Madagascans.  Starting from a sordid social conflict, the documentary shows that the “Forgotten Saint Paul” mark the end of an era of “colonization”, a term rarely used for the French Southern Territories, but nevertheless close to reality.  This is the story of the Third World, as its discoverer, Yves de Kerguelen, named it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":154855,"logo_path":null,"name":"Callysta Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":107374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lavita Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"History Of The Southern Lands","title":"The Third World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
