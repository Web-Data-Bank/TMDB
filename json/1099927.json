He spent years working with the National Academy of Sciences of Kyrgyzstan to gather material for this film project, which was ultimately to remain a dream. However, the director's efforts were not in vain: Not only did he make films in 1962 and 1988 about the highly respected Manasçı – folk singers who passed on the epic over countless generations in melodic speech –, but in 1995, on the occasion of the 1,000th anniversary of 'Manas', he also made a beguiling essay film that not only outlines the plot of the epic with the help of magnificent images and lavish costumes, but also gives a semi-documentary account of the history of the Kyrgyz people interwoven with the myth. Long inaccessible, the essay film has recently been restored by the film studio Kyrgyzfilm and uploaded to YouTube in 4K.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/epH7Wyio2GcuYqXvXA4zpiuxtgi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74486,"logo_path":"/pLkapE3cPFdM0695eoawyNavr06.png","name":"Kyrgyzfilm","origin_country":"KG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KG","name":"Kyrgyz Republic"}],"release_date":"1995-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kirghiz","iso_639_1":"ky","name":"??????"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The 1000-year-old Great National Epic of Kyrgyzstan","title":"The Universe of the Manas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
