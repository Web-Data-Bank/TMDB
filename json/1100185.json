Based on an essay John Menick published in Frieze in 2011, the video collects the dozens of appearances that the character of Sigmund Freud has made on small and big screens. After the 1950s, when pill vials replaced analytic couches, the father of psychoanalysis found a second career impersonating himself in everything from a John Huston clunker to a Star Trek episode. The video suggests that maybe it is in front of the camera, alongside surgically enhanced starlets and CGI chimeras, that “Herr Doktor” will find his final resting place.  This video was produced by the Kadist Foundation and commissioned by dOCUMENTA (13).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":195802,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kadist Art Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starring Sigmund Freud","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
