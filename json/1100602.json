Audiences will be placed in a VR scene that is 16,000 meters mid-air and embark on a fantastical journey amid a gradually disintegrating plane fuselage, which symbolizes industrial civilization. The audienceâ€™s perspective is suspended mid-air, with debris representing memories and symbols floating past. The narrative is activated when audiences attempt to touch the debris with their hands. The black box flight recorder, letter paper scribbled with blurry handwriting, and a rusty old phone sending ambiguous signals, all represent human history and memory and are rearranged according to the touch of curious audiences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"aloft","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
