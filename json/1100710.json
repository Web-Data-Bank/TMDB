With the easy comes the insane. With the laid-back trails comes the steep and deep backcountry. And with the most extraordinary snow season ever comes THUNDERSTRUCK 7. Known world-over for their chute-bashing antics, Team Thunderstruck conquers the Rocky Mountains with a proclivity toward insanity. Watch Randy Swenson, Brad Story, Dan Davidoff, Trennis Baer and many more take their horsepower, skill, and courage to the limits of snowmobiling. Watch Randy Swenson’s awe-inspiring 2500 foot-of-vertical “Super Chute”, Brad Story’s amazing crack at the “Eye of the Needle” and Wes Little and Lyle Sinden’s adrenaline-driven carnage-fest that leaves both sleds in a pile at the bottom of the hill. From shoulder-deep powder to the thrilling chute-climbing the riders are known for, Thunderstruck 7 will have you screaming to ride!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/97a4pbRAi5o5FGhSOLQxqfzCHX5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thunderstruck 7","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
