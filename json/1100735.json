An aircraft moves down the runway and takes off. Three planes in formation are seen from the air. Viewed from the cockpit, a pilot is at the controls. A hydroplane gets ready to land in a British port. Seen from the air, bombs fall on the battlefield. An enemy plane is pursued by fire from an anti-aircraft battery, while another spirals down and crashes on the ground. Canadian aviators pose proudly for the camera while an American crew attaches bombs to an aircraft.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":195861,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian War Records Office","origin_country":""},{"id":195862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Ministry of Information","origin_country":""},{"id":182669,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Film Board of Canada","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Airplane Casualties","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
