First there’s designer Chung Chit (Endy Chow), who rushes to catch a ferry and leaves his phone at home. There’s no time to retrieve the device, so he tries to soldier on without it – and the results are eye-opening. Eventually, he’ll need to call his wife Ivy (Cecilia Choi) to awkwardly help him out. Meanwhile, soon-to-emigrate middle manager Raymond Ho (Peter Chan) starts his day with his WhatsApp account hacked and frozen. Broken contacts aside, his big fear is exposure of shady workplace practices and possible blackmail or arrest. Then there’s Ana (Rosa Maria Velasco), an old classmate of theirs who’s waiting in a private kitchen and getting odd messages. And all the time a young lady, Yanki (Amy Tang), and a nerdy computer wiz (Henick Chou) are busy using messaging apps for sleazy purposes.","popularity":2.131,"poster_path":"/4cCsCiXSXGA8DWtflRM1cUPhlfC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot 2 Dot Production Limited","origin_country":""},{"id":85306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Scene","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everyphone Everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
