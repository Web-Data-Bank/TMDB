The film is 45 minutes long––perfect for classroom use and repeated screenings by stu-dents on their own. It's my response to the flawed Ken Burn/Lynn Novick 18-hour PBS series, The Vietnam War... too long for the classroom and failing in many ways as a useful account of the tragic Viet Nam war.  It’s free to stream or download the film from this website, so teachers, help yourselves. I’ve also provided a curriculum, produced by the Zinn Education Project’s Rethinking Schools for teaching this film, and some additional useful writings for understanding the Viet Nam War.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes and Images From the Vietnam War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
