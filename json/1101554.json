Danish researcher Eske Willerslev has spent more than 10 years travelling around the US to study the genomic data and what it can tell us about the early humans. A journey in which his encounters with indigenous tribes, who are today fighting to have the remains of their ancestors reburied, forces Willerslev to reconsider his own position and possible biases in his interpretation of the ambiguous data. His objective ideals as a scientist are put to the test in the encounter with the Paiute-Shoshone tribe, leading the Danish scientist to a terrifying spiritual experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t5dHVEF1CxDK0TIByL4sHZD3gIX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
