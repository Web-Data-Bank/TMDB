Karen and Wes's marriage is crumbling apart - like a sandcastle. Karen can't even make love to her husband any more - the sand has managed to get everywhere. Harry, a tax collector, is a witness to this marriage falling apart. As a civil servant he hears Wes confession. However he isn't able to help him. The omnipotent eye of television glitters above the desert - that raw allegory of America where neither the white nor the black have it good. If Samuel Beckett and Joan Collins had a romance, then their child would look like this film.","popularity":0.717,"poster_path":"/kCpd5r4nUSpiYYMaiIONDxar18V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmcontract Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":172753,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lech Majewski Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Propaganda Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1994-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gospel According to Harry","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
