By documenting beekeeping activities Makela reveals how intrinsically anthropocentric our attitudes are, and how this affects the process of subjucating the honey bee into a condition of exploitable natural resource. Thru a sensitive, intimate and prolonged observation Makela discovers surprising behavior inside and outside the hive, which she offers as a set of dialogues that bring humor, poetry, reflection and an insight into the fantastic dimension of this species.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anthropobee","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
