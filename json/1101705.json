The footage is composed of detailed close-ups of the reel-to-reel recorder as it plays back a song from Steve Batesâ€™ latest release, All The Things That Happen (Constellation Records). The introduction plays back an old country & western song that was on one of the tape reels acquired with the recorder from the family of a deceased gentleman living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Once the video shoot was complete, the reel never worked again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2GPnxRgJhkEzeQdemB67BThsErg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"These problems are multiplied by the difficulty I have in front of a tape recorder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
