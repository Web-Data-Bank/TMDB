It is a film about anxiety spreading from one person to the next, about despair over lost opportunities, about the moment you are robbed of your future. It shows people stranded in a black hole of history, gasping for air like a fish on dry land, writhing in agony like a snake held in the grip of a devil that has declared itself the master.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rhythm of My Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
