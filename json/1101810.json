But when he got injured while playing for Arsenal, things went terribly wrong. In search of thrills and distraction, he started frequenting the casino, gambling away his salary of 400,000 pounds a year. From then onwards, it all went downhill for Helder, who in this film initially evokes our aversion, but gradually our sympathy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":90848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Posh Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glenn Helder: c'est la vie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
