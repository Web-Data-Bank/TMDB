It playfully presages a new juncture for science and beauty, transforming an old Amsterdam church into a meticulously ordered space that references Aesop’s own laboratory. Here, a painstaking Scientist employs an assortment of gels, liquids, and weird contraptions to minister arcane beauty treatments to a sleeping Muse. The skin and hair play key roles for the female specimen fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of a new kind of super-sensory beauty treatment.  McRae describes her film inspired chiefly by nineteenth-century scientist and philosopher Hermann von Helmholtz, and his revolutionary research on human perception: ‘Everything’, wrote Helmholtz, ‘is an event on the skin’. ‘I wanted to suggest a journey inside a world beyond skin care, one that involves farther realms of perception within the sensory landscape of the human body.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3OaETNN3PJwkOZW8zT4hVOV6rKD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morphē","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
