It's not a story about tragedy, oil, or the environment. This is a story about how a husband and wife immigrated from India to Northern Alberta to start a new life. It's a story about the different people that came to call Fort McMurray home and how 30 years after the filmmaker was born there, his home-town almost burned to the ground.
