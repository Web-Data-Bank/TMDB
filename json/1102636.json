However, unlike most revolutionary tales during this period, the story of The Golden Wild Goose is set in post-liberation Tibet.  The film tells of a revolutionary Tibetan youth who discovers and defeats the old landlord and tribal leader who is plotting against the Communist government’s plan to end the locust plague.  Besides the combat between the hero and the villains, another important conflict in this film is between the old religious traditions and the new revolutionary ideas: the Tibetan Buddhism practised and promoted by the overthrown upper class is constantly mocked and criticised as the source of the people's suffering and as the tool for the tribal lords to control the Tibetan people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golden Wild Goose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
