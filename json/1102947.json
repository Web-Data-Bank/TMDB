Everyone in the community has a harrowing story of a loved one falling through the ice while trying to get across the lake, with pregnant women and new mothers fearing for their babies and having no choice but to make the trek in dangerous conditions. The film shows the key role of the communityâ€™s women in demanding funding for the road from three levels of government, and how their reconnection to culture and ceremony give them the strength to keep going.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qklgeNs47PzjsFLrj0OPnb2Anw7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom Road: Women / Ikwewag","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
