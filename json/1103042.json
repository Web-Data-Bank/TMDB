A stream of water starts from the deep end of the mountain. The afterimage of its surface and the small life forms beneath the water. The static forest and rocks. As we pass this landscape, we enter a long-stretching two-lane road that leads to a memorial park surrounded in silence. 2. A present buried under the past. A future which will be filled with idle hope. A present from a distant past. A present from a future to come. A present in sequence where the past and future endlessly meet. A present surrounded by silence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iHgavSDhqPGDpuAnsb03vuuD4ik.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Landscape Between Past and Future","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
