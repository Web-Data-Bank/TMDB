The film shows how lesbians are no longer a figure found only at night, inside apartments, and become a political subject that rises up against censorship of one of the lesbian periodicals with the largest circulation in the 1980s, \"ChanacomChana\". Ferro's Bar represents a space for the political-affective memory of its frequenters and a way of updating this collective and political history that is still pulsating.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ferro's Bar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
