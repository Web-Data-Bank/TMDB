The game is interrupted by a self-sacrificial rebellion. After the oppressors are vanquished, a new game is quickly reconstituted among the former victims.  Another installment in the “POUR” Series, set in a metaphorical world of living wine glasses. This story explores a twisted game of power dynamics, where two masters dominate their smaller subjects. The only way to end the game is to force the masters to lose interest. An individual glass, number 95, accomplishes this by initiating a self-sacrificial protest, shattering his own head with his fist. This becomes contagious as the others see the results. They all smash their own heads happily and the game becomes impossible to play. Realizing this, the masters move on. Tyranny requires slaves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z2rSyCoJwuSPVjy7Oe2JIuuq8Ug.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pour Games","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
