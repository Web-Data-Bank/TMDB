But the jubilant cycle is halted by a stubborn jar whose head is already filled.  Directorâ€™s notes: \"Pour 939\" is an animated cartoon that was initially drawn as an exercise in visualizing the close minded, and their role in halting a fulfilling exchange of ideas. This simple metaphor was never supposed to be a stand alone film, but the more time I spent drawing it, the more I thought it could hold it's own water (or wine). Interestingly, this short film has no real story, it's simply an illustration of an idea: The moment when people who freely share thoughts are confronted with a person who is closed up. I chose the number 939 because it felt very stubborn and limited to me.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kfCupWIxL0wDlTKIPwcS7A7Yomx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pour 939","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
