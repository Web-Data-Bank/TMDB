In ‘My Lost Generation’, Tomic tells his own as well as his generation’s story by examining what a war can do to a human being. It’s a frightening project, but it’s only through filming that he can overcome his traumas. Fear, violence, scars and distrust are unavoidable premises for the identity-less director, who with his training background from the Danish Royal Academy of Fine Arts manages to communicate his experiences in a visual, raw and poetic way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":49722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Det Danske Filmværksted","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2009-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Lost Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
