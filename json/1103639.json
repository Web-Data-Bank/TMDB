Guided by the belief that urban renewal should benefit - not displace - residents, Frances Goldin and her neighbors formed the Cooper Square Committee and launched a campaign to save the neighborhood. Over five decades they fought politicians, developers, white flight, government abandonment, blight, violence, arson, drugs, and gentrification - cyclical forces that have destroyed so many working class neighborhoods across the US. Through tenacious organizing and hundreds of community meetings, they not only held their ground but also developed a vision of community control. Fifty three years later, they established the state's first community land trust - a diverse, permanently affordable neighborhood in the heart of the \"real estate capital of the world.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yx2PiyLx3LXsqRx8TQzlTyOU3QM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rabble Rousers: Frances Goldin and the Fight for Cooper Square","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
