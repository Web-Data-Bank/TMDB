After stumbling upon what's left of his father's work, David sets off to a desert island in the Barents Sea - the one place which may hold the truth about his father's passing. Confronted by strange lights in the dark, eerie radio disturbances, and a hidden cave, David begins to question whether or not he's really alone on the island. Suddenly, a female voice calls out over the otherwise silent radio - a stranger trying to reach David. Little does he know, his search for truth is about to descend into a much larger conspiracy.","popularity":1.953,"poster_path":"/aFRMreSmCsuLYMhltiyefaaZEFT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow Island","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
