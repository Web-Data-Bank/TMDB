They meet to collaborate on a portrait of Libro and discuss their lives from the 1980s onwards. Now, after 3 years, Sadie is ready to uncover the painting. This short documentary follows Sadie and Libro's friendship and the collaboration's surprising reveal. The portrait is a first for art, important for queer politics and sensational to see.
