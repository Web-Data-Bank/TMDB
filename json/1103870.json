Having returned from the Underworld in his attempts to retrieve her, he can now no longer die, yet lacks presence. So the maenads tear him limb from limb...  Two thousand years later: An immortal head, disembodied, aware now of the power of the physical form in which it is forever encased. Upon the Templar altar, wise yet carnal, the only way it can now enjoy the idea of a body is through vicarious experience of others enjoying theirs. Thus with the heightened senses remaining in the head, s/he desires to create a new physical vessel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f9DGWJaKL1GSZnkLb5OMN0V2yrB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An EsotErotic, Surreal and Psychedelic journey of re-enchantment.","title":"SOLVE et COAGULA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
