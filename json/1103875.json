Internationally honored and beloved for his poignant, often irresistibly wry view of the human condition, Truffaut embodied the auteur's intimate grasp of the film medium. This documentary package -- a special supplement to Truffaut's films in The Criterion Collection -- is a multi-feature tribute that includes Truffaut's rare 1957 film, Les Mistons -- which foreshadowed The 400 Blows.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qoBkEaHZduD0cFTn5owrUQoabiK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"François Truffaut: 25 Years, 25 Films","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
