In three stylistically very different parts, it deals with various forms of escapism in a society that has become blind to the violence that is eroding it from within. Made shortly before the 1980 military coup, Üç Bölümlü Kısa Film was bound to appear to contemporary audiences as a courageous plea for civil disobedience.
