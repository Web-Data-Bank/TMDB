Fighter Abu Aseel, not his real name, takes us through Jenin and shows us how the brigade is training and preparing to defend the city for the next time the Israeli army enters.  Like many young men in the impoverished refugee camp, Abu Aseel feels he was compelled to take up arms, driven by witnessing decades of violence and oppression against his community.  Israel’s new far-right government has accompanied a surge in violence with near-daily military raids across the occupied West Bank.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w1yrayIbSjjKTH3trjpJerm3Osg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Life As A Palestinian Fighter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
