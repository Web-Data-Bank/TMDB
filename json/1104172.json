In this house, twelve dialogue stories take place and all have one thing in common - oppressive hopelessness. We witness everyday problems that become absurd under a distorted lens and become all the more real. The film follows with almost morbid interest the fates of people who, based on their actions and incompetence, are doomed. The question remains how far the characters from this \"house\" are.","popularity":2.88,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":137041,"logo_path":null,"name":"DNA Production","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":83880,"logo_path":null,"name":"DNA Production","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2023-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"All About the Little Things","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
