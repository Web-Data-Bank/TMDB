Albums such as KIMONO MY HOUSE and NUMBER ONE IN HEAVEN spawned big hit singles, although the band continued to plough an often lonely furrow through the music world, seemingly oblivious to whether they were successful of not. In 2002 they released LIL' BEETHOVEN, another superlative addition to their catalogue. Here, they perform the album in its entirety for an expectant Swedish crowd, with songs such as \"The Rhythm Thief,\" \"Ride Em Cowboy,\" and \"What Are All These Bands So Angry About',\" illustrating their continued sense of adventure and fun in the pop medium.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/csIXihrYWHSUhP4J4dGVfWoa2HV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Standing Room Only Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Filmed in March 2004 at the SÃ¶dra Teaturn in Stockholm, Sweden","title":"Sparks Lil' Beethoven","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
