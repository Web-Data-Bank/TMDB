Emma Northey renders this, and much else, into her arresting video for ‘Approach VIII: Becoming Halfling‘, a visual accoutrement that makes it hard to determine which came first: is it the shapes and landscape-like forms swirling in the darkness making the noise, or are the sounds, reflecting on a surface and rendering themselves into form? Or perhaps neither, both just glimpses of one sinuous, near-living being.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l3XHH9wQKcNI9I09ha5YDwtbFMp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Approach VIII - Becoming Halfling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
