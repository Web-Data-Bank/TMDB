He went viral during the pandemic and managed to get himself in trouble with pretty much everyone. Luckily, Hughesy is zen. He is at peace with the chaos he creates, knowing that from great turmoil comes even greater material. Hughesy has always attacked his comedy like a man with nothing to lose. A week hasn't gone by in the last 25 years that Hughesy hasn't done stand up, whether headlining an iconic theatre or jumping up at a tiny club. What has worried him that day becomes fodder for that night's material. To him, every audience is a great crowd and they should never forget that.","popularity":0.881,"poster_path":"/shaiTurHRJD2W3436loMM4dT3xX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dave Hughes: Ridiculous","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1}
