Despite the attempt by some in the gay community to frame the event as the spark of the “Italian Stonewall,” Alfredo’s gesture faded into obscurity. ALFREDO’S FIRE chronicles one man’s descent into darkness as he struggles to reconcile his faith and sexuality. Looking at fire as a potent but contradictory symbol of liberation, annihilation, and communion, this film tells a universal story of human longing, frailty and the dire consequences of living a lie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n1vnJnOvz5F6mD4b4LfGAUzBryG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alfredo's Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
