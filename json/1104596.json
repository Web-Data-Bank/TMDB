Hybrid between fiction and non-fiction, Story of the Eye – A Porn-noir Fairy Tale mixes 13 performers, some amateur and sex workers including a porn actor, a camboy, and a camgirl. With the collaboration of erotic film director Lara Duarte and multi-artist André Medeiros Martins, who performs works on art and pornography on different platforms, the play follows the structure of the book to tell, in fairy tale settings, the story of three teenagers in their sexual discoveries. During intermezzo, the audience watches a gig with live music and performances. Between the blatant theatricality and the explicit of pornography, the show recreates this fable noir among the vulgar and the sublime, mundane and cosmic, ordinary and abyssal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/er5QPMHlqAyLL8DcqmJ0pgdeQNG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"History of the Eye – A Porn-noir Fairy Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
