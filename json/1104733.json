The dernier cri are weekend safaris to Africa, including a photo-op with Tarzan and Jane. Gerhard and Christel Pfuscher, sexshop-owners from Bergheim, splash out and spend a small fortune on it. But then there is word of the jungle heroes getting run over by a herd of elephants, and the travel agency owner is in a fix. With her husband Harald, zookeeper in the monkey house, she travels to Africa to don the leopard fur herself for once. But at first, Liane must help Harald in return by riding the killer whale in the zoo’s aquarium. Finally, in the jungle, things are going crazy. Starzahn has to decide between two women, for cleaning lady Eloise Pütz is also in on it. A haunting of the jungle ghost, a frenzy of the instincts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96977,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entenproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tarzan - Wo die Datteln rappeln","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
