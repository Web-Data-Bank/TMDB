There is an ambiguity in their hierarchy. They might be perceived apart, joined together, one after the other, or one dominates the other out completely. This ‘relationship’ is what I am intuitively exploring. Film sees the unconscious neither as rational, or irrational. Film is a system of relations.” — E.B. 1977","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u6hkOJTBSA5EzTLr4u3GZLYWMYl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hit and Run","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
