He suffered a traumatic brain injury and was diagnosed with aphasia, a language disorder which left him unable to speak. Though 2 million others in the U.S. suffer from aphasia, few have even heard of it. Over the past five decades, Tim has struggled with relearning how to communicate all over again, navigating the social stigmas that come with broken speech, and finally letting go of the life that was snatched away from him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a1rjpCHTrqS6Y6cuqZ60wn1q5F1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blurry Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sad Song Better","title":"Strawberry Forever","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
