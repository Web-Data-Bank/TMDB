The cast were selected from the actual Sour fan base, from many countries around the world. Each person and scene was filmed purely via webcam.  The song is about discovering your own colour or voice in this world. The webcam provided the perfect medium on which to explore this. Not only did it alleviate the challenge of the non-existent budget but it also overcame the fact we couldn't film the band in person, given the fact the band live in Tokyo, and we all live in New York. Millions of people use webcams to express themselves everyday. What if these individuals were given the chance to collaborate? We felt the result could be pretty powerful and something that no-one had seen before.  The video has been picked up by Japanese news, and was viewed 700,000 times in 20 days on YouTube, and has become the #1 Japanese animation film of all time on YouTube.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aHTjLg7VBxdIUmKpH3H35JU4WN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sour: Hibi no neiro","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
