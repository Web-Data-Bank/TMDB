Combining different techniques from animation to archive material the film follows glow-worm’s attempts to find a partner in an environment that is no longer dark at night. The story about light and darkness moves from the scale of planetary to microscopic, from the calmness of nature to a hectic city and from artificial light to the green shimmer of a glow-worm’s behind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xvc7GfsFTtKsReQGR5r8kvNLtKt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illume","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strangers in the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
