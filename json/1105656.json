Featuring interviews with Maori and Pacific Islanders examining New Zealand's image as a multiracial society, and articulating the need for New Zealand to operate less mono-culturally and more inclusively.  Members of the Taupo Work Co-op speak about not having qualifications, how it affects their lives and their aspirations in life if things were different for them. The film explores an underlying tension that is presented by these issues: not having coped with today's education system, yet unable to relate to things Maori because of not being taught by their elders.  Not identifying as part of the Pakeha or Maori worlds leaves many young Maori floating or simply lost in a society from which they feel alienated. For many of these young people living in the cities, life is tough.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Race Against Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
