These spaces carry traces of the 1947 Partition of India and have been resilient in the face of power shifts, urban transformations and cycles of trauma throughout history. The artist unfolds these layers through the textures, architectural juxtapositions, and cracks within these spaces, overlaying them with animated mosaic-like stones and caressing them with a fragmented marble hand of Maharani Jindan Kaur, the last empress of the Sikh Empire and a revolutionary female character, who returns back to her place of origin and haunts the city like a ghost.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tsQEpeQRGhqQAf9fN1BgtrVCYcD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Infinite Nectar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
