The picture of the cemetery with crowds of people who came to visit the graves of the insurgents presented in a way that aroused emotions because of the power of the memories it refers to, but also because of the fact that the anniversary was private, unorganized - it was an expression of spontaneous, grassroots activity. The Warsaw Uprising lived in the memories and emotions of those who remembered it, who lost loved ones, friends, acquaintances, but also lost their city, because Warsaw is also the subject of this personal anniversary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anniversary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
