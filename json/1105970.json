In a nightclub ruled by instincts, a boy moves blinded by his ego. ‘Anatta’ is the Buddhist doctrine of the non-self, of the non-existence of a permanent individual self. Those who are slaves to their ego see separation and conflict everywhere, they are destined to suffer, they are aggressive because they are afraid.
