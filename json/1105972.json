Using still images, sound, text and her distinctive voice-over, Rhodes calls out the evils of globalisation whilst taking a truly global approach in her incisive analysis. From the atomic destruction of Hiroshima to the conquest of the skies, Disquiet draws connections between the local, the transnational, and even the extra-terrestrial, in order to untangle the relationship between violence and profit. As Rhodes poignantly asks: ‘can warnings warn, when violence is a profitable industry?’","popularity":1.023,"poster_path":"/nmGxyO7EijpDs3Zjyfpx1AM251S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disquiet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
