This story, dedicated to the daughter of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, shows regret for lost paradises. While the sentimental arranges that everything seems perfect and immutable, the romantic knows that passions never last. A man finds 15 years later, a woman he had loved. They try the space of an evening to find the lost emotions. But life is cruel and strangely repetitive, and memory fails. Looking for yesterday's dreams, they will awaken the pain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pour Bonnie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
