Lovecraft, Beyond the Wall of Sleep  OVERALL continues the project which began as ALL OVER. The creative process has become inversed since the primary material is now oil paint. The original film was painted with J. Pollock's dripping technique on a transparent film strip and then all colors were inversed in lab with a contact printer. The soundtrack was made using a signal processing environment called «Pure Data», calculating in real time the color density of the image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d0qx6VXFglIArWhNcnu2kIVxjwF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
