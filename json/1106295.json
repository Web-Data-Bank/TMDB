To do this, I unspooled the whole roll in order to have a rectangular working base, onto which I applied Super 8 emulsion from another film, in a crosswise fashion, going from strip to strip diagonally and horizontally. The visual effect is totally abstract and resembles a mosaic, with its many little triangular forms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/381fShEzyuzITegQLvkv1NOtM8H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MOSAÏC","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
