This means, in Lingala, the majority language in Congo, \"the child of France\". I lead two lives: on the one hand, my life with my boyfriend, and on the other hand, my weekends at my mother Suzanne's, who doesn't know that I am homosexual. At the age of 30, I began an intimate investigation to understand what was preventing me from telling her. By making my mother talk about what I don't know about her, her past and her culture, I discover the way to not be the only one to announce a part of my identity. This is the beginning of a dialogue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4LR8inpyA2oTMfHJRkyqmJItap7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muanapoto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
