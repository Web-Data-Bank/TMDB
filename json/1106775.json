As a consequence, she became pregnant, and the repressors performed an abortion on her \"to correct the mistake.\" In 2009, her testimony was key to achieving the first conviction for crimes against humanity of a federal judge, Víctor Brusa, and his task force. Three months later, she was brutally murdered in her shop in Rafaela (Santa Fe / Argentina). Today her murder remains unpunished.  This documentary reconstructs Silvia in the dimension of her woman, mother and friend, in her political character and in her sensitivity, so that we all know her cause. We seek a truth that does justice to her death and rescues her, above all, the value of her life.","popularity":0.825,"poster_path":"/iOSJMI3I4pYW9g8hrHByCll7RYV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wayruro Comunicación Popular","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2015-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In 1977, Silvia Suppo was kidnapped and raped during the last Argentine civic-military dictatorship.
