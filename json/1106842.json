One-thousand guests filled the downtown theater, built in 1926, to witness the singer-songwriter’s soaring set. Bareilles performed several songs off The Blessed Unrest, her Album of the Year-nominated fourth studio album, including the hit single “Brave,” a song that champions gay rights. The singer showcased her powerful, evocative vocals on fan favorites like “Love Song” and “King of Anything,” ending the set with an emotionally compelling rendition of her breakout song “Gravity.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rkUZWGfxKDzINnsWp6VusKncn3W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sara Bareilles - Live from the Artists Den","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
