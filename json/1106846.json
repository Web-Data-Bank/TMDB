Skylar and Arbor meet in a beautiful garden, reflecting the radiant energy of the characters. There is a voice over of Arbor reading a letter to Skylar that describes how they met, their friendship turning romantic, and Arbor’s self discovery of their gender.  As the letter is being read, they are seen meeting at the same spot, slowly getting closer. There is beauty and growth around them with blooming flowers and sunny weather. Skylar keeps going back, hoping Arbor will show up. Arbor’s voice over ends, saying, “I am sorry I never showed up, I had to find myself first.” Skylar finds the written letter from Arbor in their meeting spot, which is the voiceover that is happening throughout the film. She reads the letter, but the last few lines she reads out loud, “But when I am ready, I want to grow with you in the garden forever.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"New friends meet in a garden and find themselves shaping their relationship until one of them has a confession that is shared through a letter.","title":"Beauty Within","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
