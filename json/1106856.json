Muriel and Joyce get more than they bargain for when they attend the funeral of a dear, lifelong friend. After the service Joyce catches a glimpse of an affair from her past. An old song begins to play in her head and the sight of Quinn leaves her shaken; skeletons aren't supposed to step out of the closet. And before she's had time to catch her breath and slow her pulse, she and Muriel find out they've inherited a 19' sailboat. So much for a sleepy retirement and on to adventure!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rSLe0iDD2qDCxjW8qtIwpcWS55E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159356,"logo_path":null,"name":"SHE Films Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Muriel and Joyce get a boat, but thatâ€™s only half the story.","title":"Muriel and Joyce Get a Boat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
