Jeong-hae, who spent all her twenties at the factory, booked a ticket to Vancouver as soon as her time deposit matured. She was determined for her last Christmas of her twenties to be remarkable. Her travel plan, however, quickly vanished when she belatedly learned about Canada's new visa requirement, so she had to instead embark on a journey to seek a Pyeongyang naengmyeon restaurant which her deceased father uniquely enjoyed. Her excitement quickly turned to disappointment. She was destined to return home alone, but a spontaneous decision led her to meet a man who would break her jinx.","popularity":0.996,"poster_path":"/dJhPJ3Y1WoBxuBKnwOVNjRXvqwK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christmas Rangmyeon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
