After sharing happy memories about the importance of the deceased in their lives, Alicia checks her mother's belongings and finds a sealed letter from 21 years ago, written by her mother and addressed to Julio. In it, her mother expresses her unhappiness with her own life (of which she feels like a mere accessory) and announces to Julio that she is leaving him. Having read the letter, Alicia contemplates her mother's belongings in a new light and, upon receiving a call from her husband, begins to examine her own happiness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/76veZLJoDVLh17UZZIcmfg29kvY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Correspondencia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
