The story echoes her life. Through the mise en abyme, the film challenges this troubling border where fiction merges with reality, where life merges with art. A naturalistic approach that questions intimacy, drama, passion, work and love, and seeks to shed light on the most vibrant, timeless and universal aspects of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Zola Experience","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
