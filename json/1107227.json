Did you know that while at Tuskegee Institute he became one of the world's foremost experts in horticulture?\r In fact, George Washington Carver almost single-handedly reinvented land management in the South following the ravages of too much cotton and tobacco farming. He was so brilliant that Henry Ford and Thomas Edison tried to hire him, but he said no. Do you know why?\r Because he wasn't after fame or fortune. The most important thing in George Washington Carver's life was that he was a Christian. He simply marveled at God's creation and wanted to help all mankind.  This 2-part DVD hosted by Wintley Phipps you'll discover someone who grew up \"colored\" in segregated America with poverty, frailty, sickness, and the KKK, but who saw each and every obstacle as a blessing and an opportunity to learn.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1E6Cg3xRPUJZHVSwitDhAF0I4vw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Our Daily Bread Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"George Washington Carver: Man of Science, Servant of God","title":"George Washington Carver: Man of Science, Servant of God","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
