LIBRES, is a journey into the interior of man. We have obtained permission to enter and speak with people who rarely speak, in places that remain closed to the world: monasteries.  What leads a person to divest himself of the world he knows, to withdraw from it for the rest of his life? How does such a person think? LIBRES approaches great questions of the existence of man, with a single objective: to listen to them.","popularity":2.498,"poster_path":"/gD2YVL5mPBgxznXioAiLRByZ0dS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bosco Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":196896,"logo_path":null,"name":"Variopinto Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Libres","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
