Three weeks after, a man is found walking around the city in broad daylight, a dead \"baby\" in his arms. He wanders around the business district, dogged by locals who wondered, sympathized, empathized.  Following the ghost of his wife, he walks on until he reaches a river and drowns himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3wiSiMFwgPFM15Q5oA43UoIazKX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kalakala","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
