Three years on, same-sex couples still face challenges that heterosexual couples do not: some have trouble becoming legal guardians for their children; others must travel abroad to start a family; some are even rejected when applying for legal marriage status. As such, legalization was just another small step forward in the fight for equality.\r This 90-minute documentary shows how different same-sex couples fight for the life they desire and deserve. They may be fighting different battles, but they share one thing in common: the belief that the sun will shine after this rain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/55mzgzNua6YIodFDDgmOgU08DJQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Together, Stronger in the Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
