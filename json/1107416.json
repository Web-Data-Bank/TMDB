In 1989, ACT UP, a diverse, non-partisan group of individuals united in anger and committed to direct action to end the AIDS crisis, spawned DIVA-TV (Damned Interfering Video Activists) to organize independent video makers involved in AIDS activism. Working collectively to produce images of ACT UP's often massive, always colorful, protests, DIVA-TV is a prime example of how to use television as a tool for empowerment and organizing with an activist organization. BE A DIVA! is a compilation of works documenting the dynamic political activities of ACT UP.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be a DIVA!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
