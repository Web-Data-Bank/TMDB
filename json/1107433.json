None of these protagonists are destined to win the Big Fight, but all offer inspiration to anyone determined to stand up for themselves and hold their ground.","popularity":1.198,"poster_path":"/4NbqvpbKyIhxHoZG0VkaikaUTmI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never Be A Punching Bag For Nobody","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
