In the 1960’s, I made several films that used oscilloscope imagery and, in doing so, learned to ‘play’ various synthesizers to generate images. For this film, I used colored gels while filming and chose to optically print a few visual phrases, allowing for repeated sections. I also super-imposed hi-contrast notation over the film. So, Sections became a kind of feedback piece: sound generated the images for the score and performers created new sounds and a new piece from these images.” (Richard Lerman)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gSOhNZdPoQtmPXKAqATn5k9zHrW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sections for Screen, Performers and Audience","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
