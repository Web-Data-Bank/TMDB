In the center of the plot is the wandering of an artist-journalist of a Kyiv newspaper. He faces a number of internal problems: how to get along in a big city, the existence of true love and finding the answer to the eternal question - \"Who am I?\" External events echo the psychological crisis of the main character. In search of himself, he travels to the villages of the Kherson region that were flooded to create reservoirs - somewhere under the water column is his parents' native village, a metaphor for Ukrainian culture and historical memory mutilated in the 20th century.\r The man's concerns are closely related to the surrounding world: the atmosphere of the film reproduces the confusion of the entire nation: \"What will happen next, after communism and its ideology?\" In the yard, everything points to the imminent collapse of the perestroika.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xmjp1OXZFzDQc32lvhtegELI1bA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ukrtelefilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farther than an arrow flies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
