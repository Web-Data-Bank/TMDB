Toves talent is indisputable, only her husband’s destructive envy surpasses it. Tove looks straight through her husband’s inferiority complex, and yet she puts up with his humiliating behaviour and his violence. He is the one who controls her drug abuse and repeated admissions to the psychiatric ward – the only place in which she truly finds peace to write. Their power struggle needs an audience, and on this very day they’re expecting a lunch guest, the promising young author Klaus Rifbjerg, who celebrates the modern woman. Klaus believes they’ll be talking about literature, what he doesn’t know is that a blood bath awaits him.","popularity":2.292,"poster_path":"/lW6qae6GiiPnUk7hwBGsEGOEJAm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Tove's Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
