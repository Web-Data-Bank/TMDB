Achilles, the hunt leader of the brotherhood, is killed by a cobra bite, leaving his brothers Odin and Shiva to fend for themselves. With their coalition diminished they must adapt fast: learning to hunt as a twosome and defend their kills without the help of Achilles. Confounding their efforts is a host of predators: an injured leopard, a cunning hyena and a devious black-backed jackal. Making matters worse, a lone male cheetah begins to trespass on their land. Will these cheetah blood brothers survive the overwhelming odds stacked against them?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aquavision TV Productions","origin_country":"ZA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2020-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheetah Brothers in Arms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
