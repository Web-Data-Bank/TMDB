They met as pups and shared a long life together. When Max suffered a serious seizure, Felix began assembling this film as an act of mourning. Max lived two more years, happily and medicated, before he finally returned to the heavenly lap of Felix’s grandparents - Felisa and Felix Aroy - on Feb 10th, 2022. The viewer is surrounded sonically and visually by the ephemera of Max's being, a presence already becoming memory. His teeny toes tap against the floor in an omnipresent soundscape while modulated mandolin keeps the rhythm of his last steps. Composed of home videos, journal entries, and drawn impressions, this picture offers a glimpse at life's brevity interspersed by the breadth of days gone by.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":100,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MAX,","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
