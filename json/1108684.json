With a moving camera reminiscent of nostalgic home videos, Josiane Pozi answers this question by filming herself and her family. Everyday reality in a digital world is captured in an abstract and fragmentary way. The banal is elevated into something weighty and valuable, with intimate living room moments as a response to the stereotypical representations of the black female body in traditional imagery. Pozi paints a sometimes uncomfortable and rather unflattering picture of herself and her mother, zooming in on family relationships, annoyances, fun and caring for each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zKrAzXeSe5VPrHIjrVwgA8WvZMm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Capture 03 01 18","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
