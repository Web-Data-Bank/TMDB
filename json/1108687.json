But together we can solve it.  That is why Al Gore created the “Truth in 10” slideshow, a 10-minute presentation anyone can use to share the truth of what’s happening to our planet and the solutions in our hands.  The presentation breaks down the science of global warming and how rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels lead to more and more extreme weather events and impacts from rising seas to fast-spreading disease.  Just as important, “Truth in 10” explains how we can solve this crisis and create a better future for all with a just transition to clean energy, using the tools and technology here today. All in simple and easy-to-understand terms any audience can follow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Truth in Ten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
