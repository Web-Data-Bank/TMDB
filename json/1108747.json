In this surreal work of celluloid animation, Yo Yo The Clone, Too shows the yo-yo coming to life and spawning a number of organic forms â€” including a clone of the yo-yoist himself. Set to sounds reminiscent of 1970s video games, the film is a hypnagogic unfolding of shapes and sounds with a touch of Somersaulter-Moats and Somersaulter's signature Kafkaesque uncanniness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l0JSwT2k8DYMMtRRAyCA1Td0thP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yo Yo the Clone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
