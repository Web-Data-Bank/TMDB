(Xi Xi, A Woman Like Me) Sum-yin patches up wounds, masks scars and performs other beautician services that, when done well - as she always does - bring comfort to her and appreciation from grateful families. But inside she's hurting. Her job as a mortuary cosmetologist makes her self-conscious about the smell of death that seems to be seeping through and under her skin and looming over her stagnant relationship with Kwan, her oblivious boyfriend. No amount of cigarettes and perfume and cleaning will rid of it. At some point, a decision has to be made.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162469,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Such A Girl Like Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
