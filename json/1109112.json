The world of the film is created through the movement of pigment, paint, fluid by the use of „painting under the camera\" technique. The events flow into each other, degenerate in the logic of some irreversible and unnatural randomness. Their metamorphosis collides the evolutionary course with its opposite - the tree grows and buries his crown back into the earth, the world returns to primal matter, the consumer is consumed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rlHMUuwy6lq7ARSfk0CbUjN9fJN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Depersonalization","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":0}
