I wanted to organize the film frames by using the digital signal system. I gathered ON/OFF images from the LED lights blinking on streets of Jongro in night time and I manipulated them. I made the QRcode out of the serial of the black and white frames. If the digital device detect the code, it opens the webpage which has the video of the film screening. For this self-referent sequence, I intended to convey the concept of indivisibility between analogue and digital that digital has originally born form analogue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tOTPTZjunzWD070YCylVEqTmS17.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Analogue Binary System","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
