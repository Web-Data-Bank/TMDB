Out of frustration, Ravi twangs his guitar during his grandfather's classical music lesson. The old man, instead of getting angry at this behavior, challenges the boys first to a musical contest and then to a cycle tour to Kanyakumari. These challenges test the young kid's minds, characters and endurance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jctImId8YZwbMK5PI9XuR05boR3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Children's Film Society of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1990-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triyatri","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
