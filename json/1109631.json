Between France and Germany, this documentary compiles the testimonies of ordinary people who tell their often traumatic experiences: Charlotte and Linda, who were brutalized in broad daylight in front of their daughter's eyes; Max, a high school student targeted by an anonymous cyber-stalker; Arnaud, victim of a violent assault in the middle of Paris; Tessa Ganserer, elected to the Bundestag, exposed to transphobic hate campaigns on the Internet; Ria and Leo, confronted with \"queerphobia\" mixed with racism... Activists or not, they all aspire to normality, to safety and to have society stop turning a blind eye to what they suffer.","popularity":1.188,"poster_path":"/ljiGEST9KFYx31LGAGlWDfb45lP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hass gegen Queer","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
