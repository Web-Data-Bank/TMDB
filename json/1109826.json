After some weeks I caught dengue fever and was flown out to Darwin. This is my fractured fever memory of Timor and its people in ruins shot on super eight film, a lot of it while riding a bicycle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking in Timor East - Makan Itu Batu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
