Late in its life, much like Stevenson's ship, it turned up on the North American coast hunting sea otter. It made a voyage from China to Hawaii in record time and was, later on,wrecked 'somewhere in the South China Sea, maybe near Hong Kong near Lamma Island? The soundtrack is edited from field recordings made on Lamma.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9IoVDSzBGB9U22LZS3cbCNJxElL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking in Lamma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
