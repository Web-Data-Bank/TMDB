I guess this is how I think about myself too. That I will go back to Lisbon soon. But I often find myself doubting it and becoming a kind of split self. Because now with this crisis and the very controversial austerity IMF program running in Portugal I found most of my friends leaving Lisbon; and family about to mortgage their homes. I wanted to talk about this feeling of separation that I see in my generation, about this state of being in between an apparent solid past and an unknown future, about this identity in transition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4LdINzzi9QcwlI0mbe9RLOhJr32.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silence Between Two Songs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
