It features a career-spanning set that includes Wham! classics and his solo hits. This is the first live DVD of George Michael's career.\r Bonus Tracks, there are three additional songs included here (\"Precious Box,\" \"Jesus to a Child,\" and \"First Time Ever\") filmed during the tour. I'm not sure it's from this specific performance, because in the documentary they mention him changing the set list at one point, but they are still quite good.
