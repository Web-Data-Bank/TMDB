There's never a dull moment in this documentary, and even if you've seen plenty like them (you have), it doesn't make it any less engaging or charming. Highly recommended.\r Live in London is a live concert recording of George Michael's final two concerts in London's Earl's Court arena on 24th and 25th August 2008 as part of his 25 Live tour. It features a career-spanning set that includes Wham! classics and his solo hits. This is the first live DVD of George Michael's career.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6YDk507wHyg6n6NOMign7M3BYJl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"George Michael - Live In London Documentary - I'd know him a mile off!
