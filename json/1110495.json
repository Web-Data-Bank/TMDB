While they differ stylistically and vocally from each other, these virtuosi share a singular trait- the warmth and operatic intensity they bring to their individual interpretations.  The impact of the live show is heightened by sumptuous film production and striking visuals framing each performance, filmed in locales native to each artist, from the hills of Tuscany to the valleys of Wales to autumn in New England.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rGUa3eHvpXThvyIrBqdVDAzBDN8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavenly Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
