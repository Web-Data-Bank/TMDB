The only shame about the DVD is that it is so short â€” at only 50 minutes, with 13 given to the trio, 9 to the duo and the remaining 28 to the quartet. Still, with performances this strong we should be thankful for what we get.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f3yPL5RxZEUD4O0LqwZa0FtHR5z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Schofield Live In 3 Ways","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
