On this journey she discovers the Femminielli, an ancient folkloric 3rd gender, and those who are keeping the Femminielli traditions alive and well in Napoli. Life affirming community and power is found in this identity existing and being accepted for centuries. This is a trans story about discovering one's trans ancestry, weaving together personal, familial, and historical narratives. We watch as Summer learns about her ancient queer lineage and finds a greater sense of home in the process.","popularity":1.228,"poster_path":"/xrzXHJLIK7hf9968tm9mhIhqoaS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Within","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
