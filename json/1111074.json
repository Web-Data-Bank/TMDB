The lower layer shows a snowy field landscape, across which the camera slowly moves. A second layer has been superimposed on top of this: an image in which we recognize graphic shapes. Letters – without us being able to make words out of them – and composite patterns. Halfway through the film, the upper layer changes: the white letters become transparent, and the transparent sheet on which the letters and patterns appear becomes white: the positive image becomes negative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1985-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wende","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
