At the same time there’s an urge to find a romantic companion and experience more in life than a well paid job in the future. Today’s job market in Shanghai is tough. Only the best will make it.  There is a general belief that after the job situation is settled, everything else will fall into place. Is there anything more important in life than having career opportunities? How do you fall in love on a University Campus with 20’000 students?  How do you cope with personal struggles and uncertainties? Those are questions I was interested when filming at one of Chinas Elite Universities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fHB8fWluNhkXKxAoO3VvMWWmR8q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Young people in today's China","title":"Between Classes There Are Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
