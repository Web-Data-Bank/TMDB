In that sense, it can be said that interval shooting in movies has expanded human vision itself. Just as the invention of photography captures momentary movement, cinema presents a world that seems to compress real time. Interval shooting is normally used only in science films and the like. In this work, such changes were captured at intervals of a few seconds, rather than frame-by-frame. Without a timer or anything, I set the camera on a tripod in my room, sat down on a chair beside me, and pressed the release bit by bit, entirely manually from before dawn until the sun went down.","popularity":1.164,"poster_path":"/3ZZAb1xDOCWBR6I7fDPcJXcDeYk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une Succession Intermittente","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
