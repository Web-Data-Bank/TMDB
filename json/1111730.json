The animals make an agreement - to work and live in peace. Their \"League of Nations\" is joined by a fox who, having lulled the vigilance of his neighbors with the sweet melody of the barrel-organ with a picture of a dove of peace on it, insidiously breaks the agreement. One of the film's directors, Ipolyt Lazarchuk, became the \"father\" of the Ukrainian animation school in the post-war period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pjrWiWHQJbH3WATbu4nae7R9np3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ukrainfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1937-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Agreement in the Forrest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
