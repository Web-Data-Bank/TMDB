This elegiac account uses symbolic representation from natural elements in order to convey the inevitability of remembering the social and cultural erosion, and places a layer of texture in front of the elliptical glimpses of imagery, separating the viewer from the past. The re-occurring image of flames remains untouched by the erosion aspects of reticulation, ultimately alluding to nature's powerful quality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v1FG4HPDq1UE4ABFo8Lt2vMi6ao.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endless","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
