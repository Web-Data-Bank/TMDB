Reluctantly persuaded into a friends-night-out at one of their old New York City haunts, Nathan finds himself a stranger in a world where “swiping culture” dominates meaningful connection. When his friends well-intentioned frivolity stirs up visions of what once was, Nathan is caught between the desire to move on and the pervading sense he’s been left behind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":197686,"logo_path":null,"name":"MT Shorts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This moment is all that we have","title":"Still Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
