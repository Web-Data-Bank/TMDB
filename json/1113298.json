Along the way he shows you how the band’s abrupt break-up led to his career as a political journalist peeking behind the curtains of Kansas to find diplomatic wizard Mike Pompeo, Trump’s CIA Director and Secretary of State, wears no clothes. Iowa Writer’s Workshop hero Kurt Vonnegut (or some entity that knows all about his life) hosts this documentary as the ideal human from his 1985 novel Galapagos: a penguin with flippers unable to pull triggers or press buttons to bomb and kill people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7GvbVVVXBscpVYYXTboYf1HBOeB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pleiones Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"My citations remain, though the names in them die","title":"Operation Teak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
