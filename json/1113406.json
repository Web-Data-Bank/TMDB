He begins to shoot a film there, planting his camera there as one plants an agricultural tool in the middle of a meadow. He will stay there for eighteen months, giving free rein to his creativity like in an open-air artist's studio. The resulting film-essay mixes natural browsing, burlesque experimentation and artistic fantasies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parcelle 808","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
