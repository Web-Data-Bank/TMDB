The short film does not fulfill expectations of a nature documentary, much more it explores the analogies to human and animal hair and thus dares a deconstructive attempt of diverse norms of beauty and design as well as ethics of use and exploitation that shape bodies and nature. The short film asks about the so-called \"natural\", about what is allowed to grow in our society and what is trimmed, shaved, cut and domesticated. The aesthetic breaks through the use of different media (Super 8 and Mini DV) and the \"trimmed\" screen not only takes a critical look at current reception habits, but also questions overarching norms and ideals, which is underlined by the song \"mess it up\" by catnapp and the integration of collected sounds.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":"/CGwX8DAEa8qgOqhVIS53WIIHq1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"grass grows from the middle – thinking like grass","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
