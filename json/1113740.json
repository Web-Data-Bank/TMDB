People, especially young ones, were ready for a new life, as far removed from the old one as possible. Living space was much smaller and there were few, if any, servants.

Emphasis was on informal living and informal entertaining.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idyll","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
