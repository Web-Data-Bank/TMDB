Brian Johnson was officially named the new singer of AC/DC on April 1, 1980 and the group quickly got to work with returning producer Mutt Lange, who was at the helm of the group's previous record, Highway to Hell.  Ultimately, Back in Black was a tribute to AC/DC's late singer, with the black album cover serving as a memorial.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantic Entertainment Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":65827,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantic Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AC/DC: The Story of Back in Black","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
