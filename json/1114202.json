Until 2006, there was almost no Ukrainian dubbing on the big screen. According to the film's screenwriter Alina Stepanets, it is a great achievement that over 90% of films in theatres are now dubbed into Ukrainian.  The secrets of working on Ukrainian dubbing are discussed in the film by such well-known film figures as film distributor and owner of the dubbing studio Bohdan Batrukh, dubbing director Olha Fokina, actors Yevhen Malukha, Yurii Kovalenko, Oleh Mykhailiuta (Fahot), translator Oleksa Nehrebetskyi and many others. In addition, the film's characters will recall working on the Ukrainian dubbing of their first films, Cars and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y3ZogH6ox4rKjDkFJDYWejEKRq7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suspilne Media","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Ukrainian dubbing burst onto the big screen.","title":"Watch in Ukrainian!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
