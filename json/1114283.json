His collection features classic films by Eisenstein and Godard as well as long-forgotten light entertainment, and shorts. He screened the films in the basement of his bungalow, which he had converted into a private cinema. The prints were housed in his garage, his shed and in a derelict building on a neighbouring plot of land. In 2009 Wolfgang Schneider moved into a care home and the house was sold. Due to its vast size, lack of proper classification and precarious condition, the film collection has yet to find a buyer. It has been moved on several occasions from one ill-equipped storage space to another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Filmsammler","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
