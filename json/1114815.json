McGalliard in Mercer County, New Jersey. Twenty years later a Christmas tree and holly farm was established on Eld Inlet in the South Puget Sound of Washington State. The Douglas Fir in this video was meant to be harvested seven years later. Luckily, the farm abandoned its tree business in favor of expanding holly production. By 1950, the farm had been abandoned and the land returned to nature until it was sold in 2020 for residential use. The tree survived long after the farmer who planted it died. It survived the next generation. A century after planting, it has become firewood. I wonder what would have happened if man had continued to pass this Douglas by? How many generations of man would it have survived?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE VISITATION","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
