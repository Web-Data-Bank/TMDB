After the departure of US forces, he stays to document Afghan life under the male-centric Taliban leadership. With his colleague, Teddy, he heads to a Taliban stronghold in the north-west of the country, shortly after he started transitioning. If the Taliban knew he was trans, they would likely kill him. It’s a chaotic time, for the country and for Jordan, as he navigates his transformation and looks to the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/frJHftfe1SxHCepJSZCbQGhnlda.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52707,"logo_path":"/7VptgDeYqEZVyFCDL9D9TP28FdR.png","name":"Our Time Projects","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Transition","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
