The philosopher chose the image of a blind man in painting. In the film, Jacques Derrida reflects on the drawings of the Louvre's \"Parti-pri\" exposition. The director captures the emerging thought and, with the help of various representative means, allows us to see the rapprochement that Jacques Derrida establishes between the gesture of the artist and the gestures of the blind man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8dBDtlSLwGyk8UHgpb6jOUJyHga.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'ici","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":34766,"logo_path":"/atA5jWdLJ5tgyKQ5dJ6FcYLQsUo.png","name":"Musée du Louvre","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memoirs of the Blind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
