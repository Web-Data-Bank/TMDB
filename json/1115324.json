His hero is Zeno Cosini, the son of a merchant in Trieste. He is a type of useless person, defeated by life and incapable of action. The ironic insight with which the author draws a picture of the townspeople of Trieste at the turn of the century sounds like an accurate diagnosis of a social class that is doomed with its entire lifestyle and morality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenƒçina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zenovo vedomie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
