The village of Tizi N'Oucheg has undergone a transformation thanks to Rachid Mandili, who is well-aware that the development of his village depends on access to clean water and on his strong leadership of this project. Mandili rallies all the villagers together and calls upon the knowledge of French and Moroccan scientists to tap water sources, to purify, and reuse waste water for irrigation. The documentary highlights the Berbers' community ties and ingenuity in their dream of independently managing their village water resources. It equally paints a portrait of a man whose initiative and resourcefulness has opened Tizi N'Oucheg up to modernity while still conserving its cultural heritage. Tizi's example presents some of the problems of water access in semi-arid regions and puts forward concrete solutions to these problems.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s9cC8YgtUvT1ixThOMEdtnAv15d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103654,"logo_path":"/w2votb6e2Y1H6sM9P6qabMqMhix.png","name":"Y.N Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":18761,"logo_path":"/epp0KaWdPNFmSmZRXu4FGqqmAwF.png","name":"Montagne TV","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berbères des cimes","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
