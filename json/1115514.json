The electoral victory of politician Giorgia Meloni of the right-wing Fratelli d'Italia party, whose flag bears the flame symbol in honor of Benito Mussolini, and her post-fascist government have given them a boost. A hundred years after the Duce seized power, the word fascist is becoming socially acceptable again. Among many young people in Italy, being far right is considered cool. The identitarian movement \"Fortress Europe\" attracts them in droves. Fascism nostalgists make pilgrimages to Mussolini's tomb and hold rallies. Right-wing rock concerts but also intellectual \"meetings for tradition and identity\" form the ideology. A constant support is the ultra-fan scene of the football clubs. The documentary illuminates the facets of neo-fascism in Italy, lets activists have their say, but also a journalist who has been writing about the neo-fascist scene for 20 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cE9Mm1s7DXiuOBLowDFDWxOjflp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89110,"logo_path":null,"name":"ECO Media","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neo-fascism in Italy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
