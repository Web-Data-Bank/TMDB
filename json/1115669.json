A hybrid film, halfway between the journalistic documentary and the dreamlike and symbolic reconstruction of the work of Cardeña, the film reconstructs Felipe’s passage through the streets of Havana, through witnesses, but also through Felipe’s performances (such as the large floral poster, with Che’s face, still hanging in a street in Old Havana), the suggestions of his works, his dreamlike atmospheres and colors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fGFEvqwzMxcNzqF5BgM6NRREv5j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198303,"logo_path":"/ntBtNP2c2M5yJYQHh8isbKoJj91.png","name":"ElectroWish Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2013-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The history of cuban mime Felipe Cardeña","title":"I LIKE TO DREAM: The True Story of Felipe Cardeña","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
