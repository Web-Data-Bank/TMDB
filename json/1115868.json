Yet within our own Jewish community, there exists a lack of understanding of our ethnically diverse Jewish world. Through an exhibition of commissioned portraiture accompanied by a newly produced documentary film, No Silence on Race, in partnership with the Ontario Jewish Archives, explores the lives of multiracial and multiethnic Jews within the community. The project broadens our concept of Jewish identity that has historically privileged Ashkenazi Jewish culture and presents a call to action to the Canadian Jewish community about the need for greater education on Jewish ethnic diversity within the Jewish world both in Ontario and nationally.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9eobmHCh8ilj2lOsPrcVP0ZKrWy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Periphery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
