TJFF is thrilled to present three of the four episodes, which have been out of circulation for decades. “A Sense of Belonging was my attempt to put Jews on TV. Ordinary Jews, the ones I knew, were invisible on British television; apart from the Holocaust and Israel, Jews didn't exist.” recalls director Paul Morrison, “We went for a structure for the series that followed the arc of the pilgrim festivals. The premise of the series that Jews in Britain have been allowed in on sufferance, led restricted Jewish lives as a consequence, and are—or were—challenging that straight jacket.“","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eDQvNN9jnnG1BgFnN7meI0k5Rb3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A SENSE OF BELONGING","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
