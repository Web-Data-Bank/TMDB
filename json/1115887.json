It’s London 1960 and 11-year-old David Wiseman is only interested in one thing: cricket. The problem is, he’s not very good at the game. When a Jamaican family moves in next door and builds a cricket net in their backyard, David is delighted, but it isn’t long before the neighbourhood is shaken up. An engrossing and insightful look at race relations, racism and the plight of immigrants in postwar London. With wonderful performances by the entire cast and an energetic soundtrack of calypso, reggae and ska recordings, director Paul Morrison offers an engrossing look at race relations in a changing postwar London.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5TrgNh0ZIRo9zGuFhDGcZxPkHCL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WONDROUS OBLIVION","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
