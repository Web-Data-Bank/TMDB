Elefsina’s archeological sites don’t come close to being as hauntingly beautiful as these dead ships. They stand majestically like memorial sculptures and bring a magnetism to the eye. In fact, these are the neglected refugees of Elefsina. For how did they end up there, anyway? What's their story? That's the story I want to know. Elefsina Notre Amour is a short sci-fi essay, a timeless archive, filmed on 16mm color Kodak.","popularity":0.757,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elefsina Notre Amour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
