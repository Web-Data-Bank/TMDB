Ryan Avery is many things: he's a singer for an anti-family thrash band called Father's Day, one-half of an a cappella singing duo called The Best Friends, and an actor in the Phoenix-based improve troupe Catorce. His most personal project is an open diary entitled Hi My Name is Ryan, and he also draws and paints.  While Avery looks like a pubescent boy due to a hormone deficiency known as hypopituitarism which stalled his growth, he hasn't allowed the disorder to slow his development as an artist. Now, as Avery prepares to embark on his Mormon mission, he struggles with the prospect of having to put his art on hold in order to pursue a higher calling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2Y0Dt0caN1MiW3le1LxkV4TCpRE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes...
