Handia, a locally made drink which is considered staple at all the community events and  occasions, is made from fermentation of rice.

According to NSSO, an average person in rural India  consumes 220 ml of alcohol in a week.  TAADER NAAKI GOLPO BOLA MAANA is just one of the stories that are known to these  tribal lands, mostly unheard of in urban circles, yet are not to be told in rural as well.  It is one of the regular days in the life of one Santhal family where 3kg of rice yields  upto 9 litres of handia approximately. It is mostly the womenfolk who participate in the  making of this drink.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3TjuqheEPp9SU5oli50bSYxEWkT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Are Not Meant To Tell This Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
