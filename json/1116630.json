In the second film the focus shifts to Jasmin’s older sister Asma, who is studying in Peshawar with her Afghan-American friend Ghuty. Unfortunately they are kidnapped by Taliban terrorists while returning home from the wedding. Enlisting the help of Karim, a reputedly mobbed-up restaurateur, her father orchestrates their rescue. Unfortunately Asma falls for Karim in the process, forgetting about cousin Ikram, who has long carried a torch for her. Of course, getting involved with the wrong sort of man is exponentially worse in Afghanistan. However, Asma is not without her own resources. As the host of a groundbreaking issue-oriented talk show, she has a forum to challenge the caddish and corrupt Karim.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5DyCWofzLdN71qXGdb0k1L6qh1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Pushto","iso_639_1":"ps","name":"پښتو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talk Show","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
