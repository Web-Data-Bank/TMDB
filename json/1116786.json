A film written in forty days of silence, as notes for another future film, in a city less and less recognizable. Cervantes, connoisseur of confinements and pandemics, presides over a game of mirrors between centuries that connects Madrid and Beijing, while his creatures filter news, gestures and political strategies from the daily press in the spring of 2020, in a sleepwalking and unreal Madrid.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o85z606CDxIVD7fZBcPNUg38g3i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El retablo de las maravillas.
