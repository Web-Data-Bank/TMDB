Where the tattered remnants of the prisoners discarded uniforms blow free in the wind like tumble weeds and children use them to make kites to \"y in the wind. In the film these prison suits are made from paper, tied to string, flown own in the wind and set free in the streets. In the usage of paper, think of disposability and mass production, in line with the view people have of the incarcerated population, that through the prison industrial complex, are a backbone to mass production through forced labor making things such as “paper” cups.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"kites","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
