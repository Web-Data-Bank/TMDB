From a not-at-all unbiased breakdown of peanut butter brands, to a deep dive on insurance cards, to the story of tricking Nikki Glaser in a Starbucks bathroom, Greg finds the funny in the familiar, revealing there’s humor everywhere we look – even in a jar.","popularity":1.588,"poster_path":"/nI8tmmqadg5jCvWgti0PN4KXX6J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185438,"logo_path":"/dfkzQeshEOxf5vATWCPWRovYszg.png","name":"800 Pound Gorilla Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greg Warren: The Salesman","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
