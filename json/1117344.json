Although the Reth (king) has been reduced to the status of second-class magistrate in dispute settlement by the Sundanese government, he is still the focus of political and national identity for a Shilluk people composed of competing territorial groupings. At the death of the Reth, his spirit passes into the Nile.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3psTq44xEILSWfvqv8OeqXbfIyi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shilluk of Southern Sudan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
