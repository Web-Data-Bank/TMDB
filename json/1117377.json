After she runs down the stairs a flash of light happens causing a table and chair to be pulled towards it. As she reaches the sidewalk and looks around a flash occurs behind the camera when Jules is looking towards it. Her eyes become filled with dark grey clouds before another flash occurs and she is flung into the path of a moving car with her head ending up under the wheel. A man in the other apartment, Ian, hears the commotion from his apartment and grabs his phone before taking a picture of Jules's corpse.","popularity":0.611,"poster_path":"/gHkcDCJqTdlGIxnPht0D8BRCo2B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121966,"logo_path":"/2liT5RQTqImh2SHOlR3j9mdUMKE.png","name":"Crypt TV","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rubberneck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
