James, a mid-20s modern day man, has battled with anxiety and depression for an unknown amount of time. It’s unclear what caused is and the solution is even more ambiguous. While he has a loving group of friends and a caring partner, he cannot bring himself to open up, even when directly asked about it.  This causes an inner conflict for James. He cannot speak about it, he can’t resolve his issues and the contemplative suicidal thoughts are too extreme to entertain. And so he is trapped with his life sentence, with his mind as his prison. He indulges in substance abuse and often imagines pretend scenarios to escape, but these fleeting feelings only make matters worse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k0hh7BHvNlZCKE3ut5CziUcLHJl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A depressed man spirals as he struggles to open up about his mental health.","title":"You Okay?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
