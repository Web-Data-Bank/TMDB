The concept of the new album comes from Anathema’s earlier work [A Fine Day To Exit]. Lead guitarist Daniel Cavanagh explained: \"The protagonist of the story suddenly disappeared. Where did he go? Did he start a new life or start a new life? Knocked down by fate, not accounted for, and no one knows his whereabouts.\" Album producer Tony Doogan [Mogwai, Belle & Sebastian, Super Furry Animals] suggested recording the album with a full orchestra, which is also Anathema A method that has not been tried in many years. Lead singer Vincent Cavanagh said: \"Tony wanted to capture the drama of the band, the tension that can only be found when all the members are playing together face to face, and the results are quite admirable.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k4WFpeDDfmzj88aU2tJGpSjZ1SB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anathema: 奇咒樂團 / 樂觀主義者 The Optimist (Bluray Audio)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
