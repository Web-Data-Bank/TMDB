And from the point of view of her mother, the director of the school, Ira lives absolutely wrong: she plays in the troupe of a small theater, earns money by washing windows and is in love with an unreliable creative person Leo, an aspiring director. She ignores \"normal\" men and does not even want to dye her hair blonde, which, according to her mother, is an easy way to success in her personal life.
