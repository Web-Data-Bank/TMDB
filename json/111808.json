They won the National League wild card--then became the first wild card team to reach the World Series by sweeping the Giants and shocking the Braves.  The Cleveland Indians were a far different team than the one that battled in the 1995 World Series. This year, nobody expected them to beat the Yankees or the Orioles--but somehow they did.  And so, these two underdog warriors slugged it out in the heat and snow of the World Series until they reached that quintessential moment--Game Seven. Even then, it went on--into the 11th inning--the second longest Game Seven in history--before Edgar Renteria sent all of Florida into a state of delirious celebration.","popularity":0.66,"poster_path":"/pw9FrhKveSv6oVRGJjmpnYNbFgU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1997 Florida Marlins: The Official World Series Film","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
