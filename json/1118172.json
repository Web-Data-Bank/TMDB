Add one small brown house mouse. Mix in a handful of chases, stir in a few falling anvils and top off with one brutish bulldog named Spike. Yields 14 delightful cartoons! This fast and funny collection rises to the occasion with a crazy camping trip (Sasquashed), a chase through a carnival's haunted house (Spook House Mouse), an Alaskan adventure (Northern Light Fish Fight) and an encounter with an abominable snow rodent (Snow Mouse). But the most outrageous moment of all comes when Tom and Jerry set aside their differences and join forces against beach muscleheads Spike and Butch in Beach Bully Bingo. Endless fun is the main course served up in this new all-family feast of animated fun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vOPVJHAdyqj92U1e5w14BN3AIcz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17,"logo_path":"/7Qu05UOqxdTGLl3kOvkRBv723Vz.png","name":"Warner Bros.
