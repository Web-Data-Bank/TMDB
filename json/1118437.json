But were there others who survived? With the help of Yurok, Hupa, and Chinese American residents– and framed by archival remnants– Many Moons investigates the ghostly marks left on a landscape repurposed for settlement. As a ghost responds, a missing persons case becomes an interrogation of history-making as Asian community members breathe life back into gaps in the archive.","popularity":2.187,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Many Moons","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
