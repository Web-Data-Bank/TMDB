The film begins with a part of the title disappearing through a cut in its center, cutting through the middle and producing a movement from right to left, revealing a room occupied by a child and her black maid. This is followed by an uninterrupted series of animated images, a kind of fleeting moment or painting that continually transforms, until it becomes a copy of Edouard Manet’s Olympia (1863).  The second part begins with the title’s next part, which disappears just like the first one, setting in motion a reverse movement, from left to right, where images related to the first part, out of focus or from other points of view, arrive, ending with the reproduction of Félix Vallotton’s La Blanche et la Noire (1913).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From One Painting To Another","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
