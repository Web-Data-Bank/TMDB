The nation s bloodiest conflict, the Civil War, had just ended. It tore the nation apart, into North and South, Republican and Democrat. It spawned a new generation of weapons designed only to kill men, and it trained a generation of men to kill other men. From this year forward for the next 35 years, the South and the North would continue the war in the Wild West. Out of the devastated South rode the most famous of the outlaw gangs, the James and Youngers and the Daltons. From the North rode the most famous of the lawmen Wild Bill Hickok, Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson. All of these characters would clash in the hills of Missouri...The cow towns of Kansas...And the mining towns of Arizona. Towns such as Northfield, Minnesota, Deadwood, South Dakota and Tombstone, Arizona would blaze into American folklore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mGg83hMYMX3XHQyumCXDF77d7fB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mill Creek Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":185,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outlaws & Gunslingers","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
