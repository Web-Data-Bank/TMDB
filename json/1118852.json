The images, always 18 per second, are arranged as they  were filmed and are captured on colour or black and white  on super 8 film.  The only sound is the noise of the projector and – depending  on the spectators – a question, an exclamation, a cough,  a laugh or fragments of conversation in the flickering  darkness of the room.»","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aGxDyBTyxPzIjb2BiSVcCG1vux2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Filmtagebuch 2004","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
