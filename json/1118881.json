Shortly before reaching the edge, the outer fringe of the film starts to repeat itself in successive strips until it fills the screen once again, thus generating a new image, on the verge of abstraction. The film is conceived as a diptych in which each part results from the repetition of one or the other edge of the original movie. The two parts can be viewed either one after the other, in any order, or simultaneously, on two screens.
