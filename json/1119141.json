A family video-narrative made of thought-stuff, having all limbs,  not lacking any organ. The body is always there, surrounded by different scenarios  and characters. The artist’s grandmother, her cousin, her uncle, her parents and  of course her brother are the stars of this film where the limits of fiction, essay and  documentary are blurred.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1lC0JB3PfG4pvCtayZnXh7Cwu1m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carne de mi carne: entraña","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
