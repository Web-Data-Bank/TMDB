The story begins when I first learned that my mother was Jewish. She refused to speak about her past and I began searching for answers to the puzzle of what had happened to her, why didn’t I have grandparents, and why was she incapable of talking about her family? The film uses interviews of myself, my siblings, and my son along with archival footage, photographs, documents and the letters from my grandparents during the years 1939-1941. My grandparents put my mother and her younger sister on a Kindertransport in 1939 from Prague to London. In 1942, my grandparents were murdered in a Nazi concentration camp. Their 75+ letters, written to my great-aunt who escaped Czechoslovakia and landed in America, are eye witness accounts of those 3 tragic years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"letters from brno","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
