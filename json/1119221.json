They observe that the ideas of feminism diverge heavily between West and East. For two years, the Belarusian women travel across their former homeland – from the maternity ward to the Tadjik cotton belt – letting party officials, factory workers and prison inmates speak. Wearing orange vests, engaged in the grittiest sort of manual labour, they tell a tale of twofold burdens, exploitation, militarisation and environmental destruction. A harsh, educational kaleidoscope, a film-letter, addressed to West-German director Helke Sander.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/khlywa0HcZgv876h9mZhLZexZzd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ORANZHEVYE ZHILETY","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
