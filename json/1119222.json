Such was the devastation, the Germans coined a term to describe it - \"to coventrate\". This documentary explores the immediate aftermath of the attack, as panic gripped the city and half the population fled. But it also charts Coventry's remarkably rapid revival, and its role in the eventual \"coventration\" of Hamburg, Dresden and Berlin, that would ultimately bring Germany to its knees.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2600,"logo_path":"/ePDVrW3gJCd3kxi8ucLckJoG3Bu.png","name":"Blast!
