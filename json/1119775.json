In these dreams, she searches for her home and waits for her beloved husband. The dreams are permeated with fear and the foreboding of a war that could leave her without a husband and home. The film was conceived as a psychoanalytical visual essay on how a subject who has experienced loss tries to assemble themselves from splinters: fragments of memories, dreams, bodily sensations - to find this new self-image 'on the other side of the mirror' after the Other has disappeared.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/oHrODzsQK4BFeQBi6tXtyasf2pq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Splinters","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
