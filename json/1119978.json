This is followed by images of the poor life of the people in the barracks of the Sicilian countryside and the uncomfortable conditions of a school.  Poverty does not spare even the middle classes, who live in such conditions as to be forced to emigrate anyway.  Ignazio Buttitta explains how the natural riches of Sicily do not end up for the benefit of the population.  The composition of the Sicilian parliament, the conquests of the PCI, the administrative embezzlements of the DC are also illustrated.  Buttitta ends with the memory of Salvatore Carnevale, dedicating a song to him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1959-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sicilia all'addritta","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
