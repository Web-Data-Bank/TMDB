He was always in the middle of the flow, but never seemed to enjoy it. Jovial and nervous, but also angry and anxious. Somewhere between Bob Dylan and the Swedish poet Gustaf Fr√∂ding, a mix of Rock'n'roll and poetry. An outsider who endured hard beatings for his wayward choices but never saw any other way to go.
