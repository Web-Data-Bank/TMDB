A view. Watching it pass, watching it change. People come, people go. Lines, light, shapes, shadows. These films are from my Berlin S-Bahn project which began in January 2008. The films are composed of takes in which each one begins as the train leaves one station and ends after arriving at the next. There are no effects used except the reflections found within the glass.\" - Ted Sonnenschein","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fall Colors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
