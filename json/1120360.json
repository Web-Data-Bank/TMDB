He also made the first winter ascents of Makalu and Gasherbrum II. Add to his legend, the incredible rescue of Elisabeth Revol in distress on the Nanga Parbat in January 2018, and that of about eight other climbers. Urubko's story is simply unique, tells us about him and his journey to becoming the best in very high mountains. Denis Urubko is not just an exceptional climber, he is a true legend whose feats of arms will remain etched in the history of mountaineering.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uVNrmAA0M7q0fcs9xGI17VX0rRw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199018,"logo_path":"/pdBna3cCVhkdcltyvc3WNXfibiv.png","name":"C.A.M.P","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Denis Urubko - My Own Way","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
