Ideas of making Germany great again indoctrinated the German people to support them indefinitely, hiding the mass slaughter of human life behind their convincing propaganda campaigns. Hitler and his disturbed Henchmen made this genocide possible, each man as deranged as the next. Their dedication to the Fuhrer was absolute, and to gain his validation they were willing to do anything.","popularity":0.605,"poster_path":"/jb5sE9FMP2hMidmb1k429gSXYlk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entertain Me Productions LTD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler's Henchmen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
