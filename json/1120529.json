The fish gets transferred to an empty glass aquarium but tries to escape the way of human captivity, as the aquarium gets filled and crowded with aquatic designs made of plastic. The aquarium is clear and empty at first just like how spacious and clean our ocean was; now slowly gets polluted by human plastic waste that confines our marine life – just like a fish in captivity with no way to be free and propagate. The aquarium starts to bleed due to pollution and draining its sustainability and life. Glitters then get mixed that clouds the whole aquarium, suffocating the fish, mirroring how these plastic wastes consume our marine life. After all, these millions of specks of trash circle our oceans; although elegantly colorful-looking dust, it contaminates just by it as the size of ‘glitters’.","popularity":1.123,"poster_path":"/mO2ltVhmG9lRFgq2wew3uN0rHtl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Penguins","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glitters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
