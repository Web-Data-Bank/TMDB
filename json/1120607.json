For the summer holidays, he makes a trip that confronts him with his roots: an uninhabited town in the wound of the Balkans, Bulgaria. There he meets Liuben, a gypsy orphan teenager who makes a living, among other things, selling fruit by a ditch. What  Liuben really wants is to open a hairdressing salon in Germany, and earn a lot of money for his girlfriend Ilyana, with whom he is expecting a child. He wants the family he never had, far from the orphanage, in a country full of possibilities. But Ilyana's plan is to travel to Greece with a group of pregnant women who, like her, are going to give birth and sell their babies, to return later with the money. Victor strokes the scars on Liuben's torso: some are signs of his mischievous childhood while others look more recent.","popularity":2.64,"poster_path":"/h3O7t4Cf8w7WGpKTquhlIcUUP7h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Liuben","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
