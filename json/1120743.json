In London's crime-infested estates, there are two distinct groups of Tamil youths. The first are slightly wayward, yet adored by their families and subject to the usual anxieties and aspirations of their ethnic minority community. The second are social outcasts from the same homes who have criminal tendencies. When the actions of these two antagonistic groups bring them into conflict on the streets, the results are explosive. Produced and financed by London's Ragam Productions, this blend of thriller and social drama draws on the capital's Tamil community for its cast and technicians. Thanks to its unique insight, 'Siva Senai' paints a powerful and authentic picture of the social pressures on Tamil youths in the UK. It also explores the consequences for law-abiding parents and other ordinary citizens of troubled inner city areas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siva Senai","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
