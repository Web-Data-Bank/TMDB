Cocoon follows a frustrated young black dishwasher who visits adult bookstores and lives a lonely, meager existence. Filmed against a particularly sleazy (and hippie-filled) late-1960s Hollywood. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called Cocoon \"one of the finest serious short films ever made, right up there with Roman Polanski's Two Men and a Wardrobe.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cocoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
