A sextet of ghouls arrive here on the promise of a Good Fantasy, setting in motion an erotic game of destruction and renewal.  Caught in the Machines’ lottery of role-play, they breed cakes of their own likeness into the fuselage: a rush of passion that ends, inevitably, in a grisly conclusion. Attentive to the mutability and rotation of roles, the film free-falls through the terror, excitement, panic, and anticipation held within self-creation in a rumination on the enduring power and politics of fantasy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nOyPqykaf9seSYSapoDA1EhKVLZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Machines of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
