Shivaji Nagar is an urban slum at the edge of Mumbai, located right next to Indiaâ€™s largest garbage dumping ground. The SVJ Boyzz, as they call themselves, produce a crime show, Govandi C.I.D, which they then put up on YouTube. Their show is modeled on popular mainstream serials such as C.I.D and Crime Patrol. They use jugaad to procure sets and props, equipment etc. to make up for the lack of access to resources. The film focuses on six characters, Afzal, Aslam, Ram, Ruman, Shafik and Tosif, who alongside their day jobs, are pursuing their passion for acting through Govandi C.I.D. Through them and their stories, the film explores Govandi as a space, the struggle to go against the norm and produce media content, the role of the internet and their aspirations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Govandi, Crime Aur Camera","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
