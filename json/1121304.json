Picking up where he left off with the Grammy-nominated Thanks For Risking Your Life. This time Lewis has the view of someone who spent entirely too much time in isolation during the Pandemic, where the irksome details of life drew his acute attention. As the world shut down in the spring of 2020, Lewis went on a quarantine-tinged journey of self-discovery which led him to many personal revelations, including that he is old, that solitary confinement is a punishment, and that all recipes are made for a happy family of four, and most importantly, never look directly in a catâ€™s eyes.","popularity":3.18,"poster_path":"/jEJOElZRNrkHAd9T1sGVxczfRhd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stark Raving Black Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lewis Black: Tragically, I Need You","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
