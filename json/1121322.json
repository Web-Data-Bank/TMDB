Phil Philby, parapsychological PI and ex-C.I.A. hit man, took the case. A Cajun meth cooker, a sadistic country sheriff, sinister government agents, and a pricey Indian medicine man are only a few of their problems.\r Can they stop this horrific challenge to Homeland Security before the evil RV triggers the apocalypse? Hell-on-wheels takes on a horrific and hilarious new meaning. It's a wicked political satire that resonates with the weirdness of today s news. Motor Home From Hell rolls on axles of evil, powered by an infernal combustion engine of explosive, subversive humor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ydBSuZx2QBUFGZMZAOo1dNtobTZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motor Home From Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
