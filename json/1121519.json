Michael Kretzmer’s documentary exposes the scope of Lithuanian Holocaust denial in describing the experiences of two dissident campaigners for truth, Grant Gochin and Silvia Foti. Gochin’s family was murdered by Noerika and he has filed a lawsuit against the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania. Surprisingly, his efforts are supported by Sylvia Foti, Noerika’s granddaughter. The film is a brutally honest expose about the ongoing systemic antisemitism in Lithuania as well as a passionate demand for justice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gKmUC66Fh07Zh09kbR40G93JaqA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J'accuse!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
