In February 2022, at the peak of the pandemic, they first become aware of each other’s existence when both are tested positive for COVID-19 and are required to self-isolate at home. The two soon form a bond through music, rekindling their passion for life. Like the partition between the two units is no barrier against the flow of music, social isolation does not bar the growing affection between them. But when the quarantine ends, they become hesitant: Will the magic survive beyond the protective/restrictive wall? A pandemic and local version of Begin Again (2013), the two characters bare their hearts as they chase their dreams amid struggles through music and lyrics.","popularity":1.917,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":199316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hong Kong Film Arts Association","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"February 2022","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
