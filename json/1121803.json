Financially ruined, Kwong is ready to go by sleeping pills, until his attention is called to a TV commercial of a sex hotline. He is connected to a female voice who calls herself Sugar, who, initially flirtatious, becomes alarmed at the weeping suicidal voice on the other end. Sugar then tries to keep Kwong on the line by sharing her own life. Inspired by an article about a disabled sex worker, the short is a tribute to these alternative sex workers.","popularity":1.711,"poster_path":"/mKU8pU655A9CRG677BfMNQ8KBUC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Between Two Ears","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
