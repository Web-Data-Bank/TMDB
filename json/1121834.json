Coming home for dinner and facing her demure mother, the agitated daughter alternates between derisive manipulation and loving care, oblivious to the uncommonly preoccupied and nervous mother who nibbles at the bitter melon without a word of reproach. Filled with tension and deceptively simple, the very short drama is a powerful portrayal of mother-daughter dynamics in a modern single-parent Chinese family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kiBKErvM1KZRUCnErzg8CEoDXEC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chang Tso-chi Film Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2022-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye Again","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
