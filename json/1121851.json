John is a key figure in British cinema and his contribution goes far beyond making Animal Farm in 1954, Britain's first animated feature-film. He produced more than 2000 films between 1938 and 1995, launched the careers of hundreds of British animators and was a visionary who wanted to create a post-WWII utopia through Socialism, animation and international understanding. The film was commissioned and produced by his daughter Vivien Halas who runs the Halas & Batchelor archive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Halas Remembered: An Animator Ahead of His Time 1912-1995","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
