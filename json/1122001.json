He wants to know exactly what happened. Everything started with a wedding. While the guests cried at the church, no one remembered it later as vodka was poured like water. Although the forest path seemed straight on the way back, there was a sudden and unexpected change of circumstances. Zofia Antoniak's diploma film is a funny anecdote about a spectacular clash between man and the bear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5hGfPNoXmeff6ahF7m39DBEewdt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2014-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
