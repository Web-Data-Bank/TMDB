THE SEPTICHEXEN POEM:  Deep below the city's streets,  The witch in darkness waits and eats,  Her magic seeps into the water's flow,  As she seeks an heir to follow.  Beware the witch with magic dread,  Her lair of filth, her cauldron red,  For she seeks a child to train in her way,  And make the water turn foul each day.  So do not stray too far below,  Or the witch will catch you, don't you know?  For in her realm, she rules supreme,  And the darkness there will never beam.","popularity":1.526,"poster_path":"/yW7ra6ZL30ubX1ZRwOCGk1fky0E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136823,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ã…TSELFILM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"","revenue":10300,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Entombed in the veins of the sewer.
