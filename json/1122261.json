The barrels usually thrown by Donkey are transformed in a series of objects representing the current mass media. On three different levels, it offers a critical view on our society. The main characters are not heroes but passive turkey cocks, moving inevitably towards their own destruction. The game that manufactures the image is still here, but in suspense, stopped, waiting for an interactivity which it is constantly denied. Insert Coins is a video which re-visits the aesthetic of the video game, using clich√©s as the last remnants of the game before its total destruction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insert Coins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
