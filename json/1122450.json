How did Cahn rise from relative obscurity to worldwide prominence and acclaim? Raised a Reform Jew, and hardened as an atheist, why did Cahn beg God to reveal Himself by laying Cahn near death's door? Was it Cahn's wake up call to surrender to Christ? But why? For what purposes?  Now, for the first time ever in the biographical documentary, The Harbinger Man: The Jonathan Cahn Story, Rabbi Cahn reveals (in his own words) his journey from being God's enemy to becoming a close confidante.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Jonathan Cahn Story","title":"The Harbinger Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
