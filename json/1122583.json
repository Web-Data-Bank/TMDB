Billions of glassy gazing zombies roam about limply, decomposed as they are, and regain a little liveliness only to run after the last survivors who have the misfortune to come out of their lair. In Paris, three losers realize that ultimately all this does not change much in their lives. Deciding to take their destiny into their own hands, they open a pizza delivery and home video business. After a difficult start, their success grew as soon as they promoted themselves by stapling leaflets on the faces of the dead. But then one morning, they discover that it has just opened, right in front of their shop, a Captain Pizza HD franchise: the world's largest chain of delivery of pizzas and HD movies on USB key... Curse! Will our heroes triumph over this unfair competition?!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gjQSbOlWE20FN6vRMwN4bxAeldY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apocalypse Pizza Video","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
