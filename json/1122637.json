It records in part the development of a wetland site into a housing development, using a variety of filming strategies including animated permutations of sets of framings, as well as freer sequences that make use of the Bolex camera’s motorised zoom function. A variety of lenses was used, from 10mm wide angle to 300mm tele-photo, which latter compresses the space, and hence the atmosphere, to create ephemeral, unstable shots full of airy ‘noise’. - Nicky Hamlyn","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1991-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only at First","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
