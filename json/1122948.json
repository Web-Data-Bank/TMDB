Ukrainian citizens are forced to find a new normal under the constant constriction of war. Four burgeoning stand-up comics utilize comedy to reconcile the challenge of resuming routine life while living in an embattled state. Drawing inspiration from their daily life, they build provocative comedy routines providing witty, biting, and poignant commentary on war, their country, and resistance. As an act of rebellion against Russian forces, they take their tour on the road, traveling to theaters, shelters, and the frontlines to deliver joy and comfort to their countrymen.","popularity":1.883,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":191218,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Nacelle Company (US)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Comedy of War: Laughter in Ukraine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
