The film, mostly without dialogue, depicts a fashionable, attractive group of young people (perhaps all age 20?) in cocktail parties, nightspots and office buildings -- assumedly adding up to a statement on the lives and lifestyles of modern, well-off undergrads. It's set in a lively Philadelphia of new architecture and expressways, though foreboding radio reports of the Vietnam War are never too far off.\" - Jay Schwartz","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twenty to the Third Power","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
