Milena, a film student is locked in her parents' house. She is not allowed to travel, so she is forced to spend the quarantine and the Easter holidays alone. The situation with the corona virus makes her feel alone and imprisoned, while her dreams, goals and life are postponed along with the end of the lock down, so she chooses to spend her time, continuing her life inside a video game, while time around her he passes, without her.  It is a documentary-self-portrait that has characteristics of a quarantine diary. In the film we see Milena learning to cook, continuing her distance learning and the resurrection from her balcony. The two realities: that of the game and the quarantine get confused and one seems more real than the other. \"","popularity":8.458,"poster_path":"/59mESM1EAvQ4iyubpUnV3xNuZUe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178474,"logo_path":"/AvEu3FUJOiul65MTD74MQmQckQi.png","name":"Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2023-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Real life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
