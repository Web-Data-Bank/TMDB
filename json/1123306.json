During\r WWII, 125,000 Japanese Americans were incarcerated, including the Namba family. May’s\r granddaughter, Miyako, narrates and guides us through her grandmother’s experiences living\r at Minidoka. Miyako packs a suitcase heart-wrenchingly contemplating the most important\r belongings to bring to the prison camp. She makes a mattress out of hay and lays down in a\r horse stall to use as a bed, just as her grandmother did. Throughout the film May and Miyako\r share this complex history—the injustice and love of country—that’s rarely discussed in\r history books.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oPSvz3rFbeYZrplZ3hUk20ADXDG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Namba","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
