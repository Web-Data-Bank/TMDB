It is the beginning of an exciting story that will link the lives of these two people who have in common not only a love for photography but also the fragility of an artist's life. Je reste photographe follows Ananias through his encounters and his travels as he throws himself body and soul into a long work of research, reconditioning and conservation of the negatives of Paul Kodjo and thus lifts the veil on the tumultuous journey of this last.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":199500,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Rencontres du Sud","origin_country":""},{"id":199501,"logo_path":null,"name":"TSK Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CI","name":"Cote D'Ivoire"}],"release_date":"2022-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Je Reste Photographe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
