This inveterate animal lover presented us yesterday with his short film  Crocs urbains.  Brilliantly produced, this 23-minute documentary plunged us into the urban barbarism of hound fights, a macho, phallic, clandestine world which, on the margins of society, features combat dogs programmed to kill, violent scenes which in no way condone violence.  Against this backdrop of machismo, a luscious and charming doctor describes the suffering and mistreatment of these animals and calls for an end to this kind of barbarism!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97934,"logo_path":"/udAuMSL53Yv0CEKIRNUdbX8nMUm.png","name":"Fédération tunisienne des cinéastes amateurs (FTCA)","origin_country":"TN"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Crocs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
