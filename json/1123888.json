In its half-sung, poetic monologue, the Sun directs its lover, a human - and in an unsettling manner, presents a gloomy vision of a collapsing world, where the only lasting and immutable elements are the words and language. The Sun‘s speech is a juggle of styles and moods: it goes from the elevated and emotionally-charged confessions to the goofy stand-up comedy, and ends up with an interpretation of „I got love“, a song from the 1970 musical Purlie. The general ambiance of the film is dark, but the sung monologue leaves a space for hope and marks the significance of words as tools of social responsibility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wfvRpr6Ip93zS17nhjpAn3SRzhb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
