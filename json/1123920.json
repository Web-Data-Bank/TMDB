His love of black music connects him with the legendary Californian funk band Tower of Power – and with the young Valais Stefanie Heinzmann. Great emotions and razor-sharp rhythms were guaranteed on this evening.\r In the Beat era, Tom Jones was Britain's first true \"soulman\" – an explosive performer who has been compared to Wilson Pickett or Solomon Burke.\r Ten years later, Tower of Power were one of the first white bands to produce first-class and credible funk.\r And today it is the Swiss Stefanie Heinzmann who is inspired by the spirit of soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mMLBWXMM5w8rhVKvMNW1fGBM80X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom Jones - Avo Session Basel (2009-11-09)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
