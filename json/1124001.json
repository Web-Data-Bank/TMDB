The study was based on observations made in public restrooms in St. Louis, colloquially called \"tearooms\", where homosexual men of different socioeconomic classes engaged in sexual contact. With his controversial research methods, in which he observed sexual acts as a voyeur, or so-called watchqueen, and conducted interviews, Humphreys deliberately broke with the ethical protocols of science. The film explores Humphrey’s intentions and the context of his research as well as the personal and professional impact of the study on Humphrey’s career.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jnZoddDgOtrRUeLzgSAeyw7wZ05.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masquerades of Research: Part I","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
