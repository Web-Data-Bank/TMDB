His father moves with him and his brothers to Tangier and re-marries. Then he leaves the family again and goes to Holland.

The boy steals from his own father and flees to the mountains, to Ketama. When an inner voice leads him back to Tangier, his father, to whom he is indebted, is dead: the trauma of his life.
