Interviews are used in the film to lead a discourse on day-to-day dealings with sex and identity and explore how these are construed out on the street, in film/on television and in personal relationships. How can insinuations and overtones be counteracted? Who or what decides a personâ€™s sex? An active queer community exists in Berlin. Queering is perceived as an exercise in re-examining experiences, perceptions, knowledge, constraints and desires.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vmSBBmNFSnBRCm0ERlkmQcyVZcJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Working on it","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
