The goal was to intercut material from both films to tell a story in a way that favors the strengths of both. With a runtime of about 2.5 hours, it aims to enhance much of the excitement and mystery from the two films by unfolding them in parallel and playing them off one-another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
