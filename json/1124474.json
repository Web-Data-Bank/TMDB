Wiener and William B. Wiener—brothers with different mothers—who were raised by their business-minded father in Shreveport, Louisiana. Fellows of the American Institute of Architects, the siblings’ early work was fairly traditional but a 1920s visit to Europe’s Bauhaus design school inspired them to approach architecture with a more innovative and artist-led vision. Between them, they produced one of the earliest and largest clusters of modernist buildings in America, slowly turning their deep south hometown of Shreveport into a beacon of modern architecture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/juKohwndqDCHqcreEjCW8ISgFzq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unexpected Modernism: The Architecture of the Wiener Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
