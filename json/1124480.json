You are invited to enter a prismatic rumination on perceptions of spacetime, along with the related confines of language and the complexity of perspective. Revelation 360 poses spatiotemporality as an interrogation, giving you the freedom to navigate through time and space, while indicating the limitations of our conceptions, inevitably tied down by our situated experiences and the circumscriptions of language. The narrator sees you and offers suggestions for your interpretation that are both certain and uncertain, reassuring and unsettling - leaving you as both the watcher and the watched. When does it start, where is the middle, and how does it end? Are these even the right questions?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w8m6ZcYAI6qWIlusXujjmQQaqT5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reedoco","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Experience the Experience of Watching","title":"Revelation 360","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
