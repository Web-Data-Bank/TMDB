The film combines places and people that best capture the country’s wartime spirit. The locations are: the relatively safe cities of Kyiv and Lviv; the cities under daily missile fire of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv; a trench at the frontlines near Donetsk; and the beaches of Odesa.  The film presents a day in the life of a beach police patrol, a woman anti-tank missile operator, a water delivery driver, a mortar unit soldier, a rapid assault unit soldier, a 14-year-old pub janitor, an artist and a former member of parliament. Together, these people and places create an engaging mosaic of a day in the life of Ukraine.","popularity":3.491,"poster_path":"/5uTB99k7w50dd9HizCzr8N5PNB5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117001,"logo_path":"/tLhSGNNKX4VwCNbvPMissO3ea5j.png","name":"Babylon'13","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Ukrainian Independence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
