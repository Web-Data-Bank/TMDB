Thematizing and problematizing the life of Serbs in Croatia was considered an expression of \"Great Serbian chauvinism\" and \"disturbing the public\" in Yugoslavia. The film unmasks the alleged struggle for a just society during the so-called National liberation struggles. The partisans from Kordun tell how, with false promises about a better life and a happy future, were deceived by the partisan elite led by Josip Broz Tito. Instead of a society of equality, after 1944 a society of class differences was created. Thus, people from the poor regions of Yugoslavia become cheap labor in capitalist countries because they cannot find work in their \"socialist\" country. The film is a prophetic anticipation, which is why socialist Yugoslavia failed and because of which Serbia has been collapsing for decades.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dunav Film","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revolution that Flows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
