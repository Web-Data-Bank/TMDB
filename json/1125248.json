All done with the ease and artistic self-confidence that the Serbian film director has. With that gypsy music of the Balkans plus some rock, they capture here with a lot of energy and humor an almost circus show. Recorded March 3, 2005 at the Luna Park Stadium in Buenos Aires.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/62JC9qhjinXUMtjCcERY9yYfRjJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2356,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rasta International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emir Kusturica and the No Smoking Orchestra: Live is a Miracle in Buenos Aires","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
