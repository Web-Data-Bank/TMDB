A regular winter morning transforms into an extraordinary event, and everyday life becomes part of a great war. Time slows down and space shrinks. And while the familiar world is collapsing, it's still necessary to water the flowers and buy the cat food. Explosions, sirens, queues, shelters. Evacuation, roads, checkpoints, volunteering. To leave or to stay? Which direction to run? There's a river beyond the forest, and a bridge beyond it, but you can't see it. In case of heavy fog, try to follow the sounds. This essay-film, shot on a smartphone, attempts to capture the feeling of the 'here and now' at the end of February 2022, and to explore everyday life during the war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4O8rXw0jig2hnudVVdHhaRLqpDl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
