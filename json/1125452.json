Both sobering and uplifting, Zero Waste paints a portrait of both the magnitude of the problem, and the perseverance of those people willing to address them.","popularity":2.15,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero Waste","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
