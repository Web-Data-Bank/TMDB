The images consist of visual research for future film projects and were accumulated during my many location scouting trips to the United States between 1980 and 1995. Over time, I have come to regard this photographic archive as a collection of works of historical and personal value. Over the years, I began to rework the photographs. The more I handled and touched them, the less I thought of them as photographs and the more I saw them as something that could be hand-shaped, altered, transformed and re-imagined. With three voices for Joan LaBarbara, composition by Morton Feldman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wbFDVFK2ItbB0QwJmfpywwqWNNi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Field Trip","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
