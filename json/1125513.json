They are images of bizarre habitats and seemingly magical worlds. The mighty Alps in the south, rugged coasts in the north, unique natural spaces, divided and reunited: Germany, located in the heart of Europe, has been shaped by countless social, economic and ecological upheaval processes. A country in constant change. Satellites open up completely new perspectives. The view from several hundred kilometers high reveals unknown dimensions, surprising insights and connections, captured in spectacular images.","popularity":3.362,"poster_path":"/gjX6feyZAGUSqZfNvWXFgyubGzn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2684,"logo_path":null,"name":"2Pilots Filmproduction","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Germany from Space","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
