The young man, visiting a cabaret, the meeting place of frowsy post-impressionists, is impressed with their windy theories, mainly denunciations of everything that common sense and decency understand. Dick is just ignorant enough about art to be impressed with this buncomb, and takes Dorothy to the Cubist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It is a fine feature for a farce and is carried out cleverly and with unction.","title":"The Post-Impressionists","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
