The oscillatory movement of the rocking chairs on which visitors sit partly helps to alleviate the syncopated rhythm of the montage and the frenzy of images that follow. A series of brassy characters in wigs and thick make-up map the various locations of the film: a lazy river, a hobby barn, and forest watchtower. These sets have been permanently built in the countryside near Athens, Ohio â€“ the area where both artists grew up. The last two spaces have been reconstructed in the museum so that reality keeps re-framing itself between moving images and concrete walls.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plot Front","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
