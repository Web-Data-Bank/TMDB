The room – a mysterious, dreamlike space – seems to exist somewhere outside of time and plagues the protagonists with visions and flashes of surreal moments. On one side of the room resides River, a photographer who uses her camera to place a barrier between herself and the world. Evelyn, on the other side, is a dismissive person, who is beloved by all yet known by none. A table at the centre of the room, prepared for a fancy dinner, calls out to them, and when they both sit down, two worlds collide. Within the room they go on a journey through time, a voyage in and out of consciousness, as they discover what could have been, what would have been, if they had made a different choice somewhere along the way, and they realise that they are not quite as unknown to one another as it may seem.","popularity":4.297,"poster_path":"/dpyyJURxtwaeXHBtZGVELVBugL5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2023-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pull Back the Curtain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
