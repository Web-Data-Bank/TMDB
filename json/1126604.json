It is estimated that one-third of all Internet content is pornographic and that 1 in 4 Internet searches are porn-related. However, few media programs investigate pornography's impact beyond the simplistic cause-and-effect question of whether it is linked to sexual assault or sex addiction. Dr. Chyng Sun, the director of The Price of Pleasure: Pornography, Sexuality, and Relationships and a professor at NYU, zooms in on the perspectives of Taiwanese users. With striking frankness, Asian men and women discuss the role pornography plays in their relationships and their sexual imaginations, desires, and behaviors. Through the lens of psychological theories (Dr. Zhana Vrangalova) and cutting-edge sexual script theories (Dr. Paul Wright), the film provides a nuanced and balanced analysis about pornography's effects.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pornography's Global Impact: A Case Study in Asia","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
