It was broadcast only in Germany at the time. By 2010, after nearly 40 years, it seemed desirable to recycle the performances and interviews with the composers and to create a revealing look back to those years for English-speaking New Music fans. The film offers valuable insights into the nature and issues of advanced composition at the beginning of the 1970s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5rZpShJSaXqbygLeaaD0wRYEM7z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Music: Sounds and Voices from the Avant-Garde New York 1971","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
