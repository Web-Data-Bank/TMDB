It is a deep pain that throbs and reverberates in tides and waves. Like my feature film, Compensation, Pandemic Bread is about communication. It’s a unique view of an interpreter’s world and how she negotiates an end-of-life call while engaging in the stress-relieving process of baking bread. Pandemic Bread is a cathartic artistic expression to ensure that we don’t forget what we went through and that we acknowledge our pain and grief rather than gloss over it.","popularity":2.152,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pandemic Bread","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
