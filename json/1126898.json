Political and cultural figures are coming out, but insults, physical violence and cyber harassment are claiming more victims. While society is becoming more accepting of homosexuality, discovering oneself, growing up and asserting oneself as a homosexual is still a unique and lonely journey.  Homos en France is the film that tells the intimate story of being lesbian, gay, bi or pan in France today, whatever your background.  Through the testimonies of anonymous people or celebrities, the decoding of the great stages of self-discovery, the re-reading of powerful images, of homosexual pride, but also of the more or less conscious homophobia of our popular culture, the film shows the incredible battle that has already been fought but is still unfinished. The struggle to be oneself and to live like others.","popularity":3.53,"poster_path":"/7w4tinJgzVOowI2Xb7ud0p0APzv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":88002,"logo_path":"/zV5SSl4WlW9Dh63M9dqhZiEPRCF.png","name":"Bangumi","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homos in France","video":false,"vote_average":8.333,"vote_count":3}
