This film, INSIDE/OUTSIDE is based upon Monika’s processes over many years.  Robert Golden has had the privilege of meeting and photographing some of Monika’s late work. Although her teaching is for performers, Robert has said that her gift of understanding humanity has been gifted in some small ways to him.  Monika’s inspirational way of working, helps actors to find a unity between their inner psyche and its outer expression.  The 46-minute film shows a precise description of her work. Monika explains it in detail along with thoughts about movement, performance and theatre. The insightful and entertaining book and film are relevant to actors, dancers, Laban yoga, Feldenkrais, Pilates and other sports and movement systems and to people working with children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ybikvOvG4CbM1wvl30kl4Rmz9j5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside/Outside","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
