Lost in a remote Kazakh town populated by eccentric, yet grounded, characters, The Village explores people’s differing views on social issues, smartly looking for the answers amongst the absurdity. Gorgeously shot, this film is a meditative understanding of the world around us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"АУЫЛ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
