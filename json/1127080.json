In the tombs of the pharaohs, on temple walls and ancient sites all over the world, she uncovers not only one code but two. One code that we use today in our current mathematical systems and a second code that hints at something more ancient and much more profound. She interviews geneticists, archaeologists, biblical scholars and quantum physicists that have all picked up the same code in their work. Could this be the next part of our evolution? Melissa weaves together profound evidence that our greatest human potential is hidden in plain sight, waiting for us to understand how the universe really works.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zuquAqmNOXss9PwAGpMJ4xmCXpT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hathor Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There is a Way Out of This Matrix","title":"Code 12","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
