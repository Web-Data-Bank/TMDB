In a new video work, he draws lines between the series of treatments he experienced and the building’s need for care and healing. Just like the osteopath examined his body, he examined the building – mapping it, listening to it, and identifying the aching areas. Through poetic filming interventions, Lahiani looks at the building with aversion and compassion and holds a ritual of healing of the building, of the city, and of man’s brittle facets.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blueprint","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
