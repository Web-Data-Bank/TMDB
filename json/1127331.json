Several sound and visual archives were used for the creation of this experimental documentary which considers videography as being itself a heterotopia, as much in its content as in its materiality (here, video cassettes).  Ideally, this project should be broadcast through two channels (cathode televisions) placed opposite each other and between which the public is invited to circulate.","popularity":1.619,"poster_path":"/xwwWtVFLxzpeGpSYzS47gsEvTAr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VHS (Video Heterotopic System)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
