She plays the role of Jacob in an attempt to come to terms with her religious upbringing, and her anxious ambivalence towards her own agnosticism. Inspired by the in-camera techniques of the early cinema of Meliese, the film and all of its special effects were shot and edited entirely in-camera in one take.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p6QsAeKscARY5KaYPPY2dEjWQwq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playing Jacob","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
