Bernstein drew analogies to other disciplines, such as poetry, aesthetics, and especially linguistics, hoping to make these lectures accessible to an audience with limited or no musical experience, while maintaining an intelligent level of discourse: Bernstein provides two distinct meanings of the term ambiguity. The first is \"doubtful or uncertain\" and the second, \"capable of being understood in two or more possible senses\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oG6HjmGyHgFVKNZBj5UIWYc6Yz5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21363,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harvard Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-11","revenue":2000,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bernstein at Harvard","title":"The Unanswered Question IV : The Delights and Dangers of Ambiguity","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
