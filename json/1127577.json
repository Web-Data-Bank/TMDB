In Nabeul in Tunisia there are a very large number of potters' workshops. The phases of pottery making are shown in detail: kneading the earth, turning the shape according to two different techniques (Nabeul-Djerba), firing in a traditional kiln and applying a decoration with metallic reflections. In Manises in Spain, a potters' workshop still manufactures ceramics with metallic reflections according to traditional techniques kept secret. The appearance of the metallic reflections is due to the cooking methods, each piece undergoing three successive firings. The potters turn, dry and apply this decoration on different dishes and jars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mCtiQD8WYbo3V066er4xHNhXgXk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terre, or et azur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
