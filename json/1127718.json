While it’s just a Tuesday, this is no ordinary night – it’s Valentine’s Day, a night when nobody wants to be alone. Riky is happy to be spending the evening in the company of his co-workers Modřín and Mates, and they’ve got their hands full. Underaged kids want to get in, drunks don’t want to get out, and everyone keeps losing their cloakroom tickets. In the middle of all of this, Riky’s ex shows up, and she isn’t alone.","popularity":4.364,"poster_path":"/9ByHxQsJIDDd1NPKxI5w3VKRGuS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":118493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shore Points","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2023-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love, 9 to 5","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
