In this propagandistic documentary, the director juxtaposes images of class hierarchy and conflict in the West, with images of a flourishing East.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rOTxJlPwe1V37cl2y41XSKutPeN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80379,"logo_path":null,"name":"VEB DEFA Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1963-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brüder und Schwestern","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
