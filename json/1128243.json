A first-person narration traces Méliès' early interests in drawing and magic shows. He builds a studio and constructs his own camera-projector, recruits dancers from the opera and actors from the cinema to make a variety of films that tell whole stories: histories, dramas, documentaries, and ads. He moves from farce into sophisticated comedies, developing cinematic tricks (dissolves, split screens, and double exposure) to create artificially-arranged scenes. Then, the cinema passes him by, and he lives the last years of his life in poverty, selling toys out of a shop near the Montparnasse train station, with Jeanne d'Alcy his star.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Georges Méliès: Cinema Magician","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
