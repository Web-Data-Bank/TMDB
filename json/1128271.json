Is agribusiness more interested in producing profits than producing food? This PBS independent documentary investigates U.S. and European agribusiness in the Third World. Filmed on five continents, it takes a close look at agribusiness, which is turning the world's food supply into a global supermarket, buying food at the lowest prices-regardless of small farmers and local populations-and selling it at the highest price and the greatest profit whenever possible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g38qupRULLdDgrYSjjHKRprP7yo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Richter Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":75306,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Day Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hungry for Profit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
