I was very humbled to have this piece finish a screening with works by Joonas Jokiranta, Azar Saiyar and Marja Viitahuhta.  I think it's appropriate to release this to the public on this day, the 6th of December that's the independence day in Finland. This day and the way it is celebrated epitomises pretty much everything we attempted to dissect with this piece. The glorification of war, among other things with the yearly televising of The Unknown Soldier; nazis and other white nationalist fascists marching on the streets of Helsinki, carrying flaming torches; and of course the Linnan juhlat aka Suomi Cuck Awards as affectionately described by our anonymous founding member last week.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/33YBSLqE0aLQWCNCTlcTMcgFnAx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RIP SUOMI","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
