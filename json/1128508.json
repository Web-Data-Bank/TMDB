The original footage from the first trip provides (un)spectacular insights into the everyday life of the people and, in contrast to the new footage, great changes become visible. Have the peopleâ€™s hopes been fulfilled, were their fears justified? The conversations with the rediscovered protagonists provide information about their state of mind today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8677,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGS Film","origin_country":""},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deutschlandreise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
