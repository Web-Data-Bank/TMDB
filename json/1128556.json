Commissioned by Liverpool Biennial, the film was created with a mixed cast of professional actors and local people from the recovery community. Stephen is based on the real-life story of Thomas Goudie, a clerk at the Bank of Liverpool, caught embezzling money to support his obsessive gambling. Goudie’s arrest became the world’s first crime-reconstruction and first film made in Liverpool in 1901 by filmmakers Mitchell and Kenyon.","popularity":4.148,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Modern Films","origin_country":""},{"id":186071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liverpool Biennial Organization Committee","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Stephen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
