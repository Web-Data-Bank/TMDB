It is about walking until you disappear into space. Being swallowed by sea, sky, or earth and the claustrophobia and intimacy of being surrounded by nature. We consider penetration as a cinematic rhythm, and experiment/perform being penetrated by air, water, fingers, and text. Thinking about porn as a genre which can be empowering or degrading in itâ€™s engagement with women and their bodies, we use our own bodies to picture these extremes, at times our bodies are performing power and at times they are not. We also utilize our bodies in a satirical sense to experiment with presentations of gender, in relation to each other and our surroundings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/78sOozO7T6lV183WuypPaUAkRT8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell Me When You Die","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
