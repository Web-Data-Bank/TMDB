The conflict the students witness and unintentionally participate in leads to a conflict within the group itself and to a questioning of the role of the artist in the war zone. How possible is it to remain neutral? Are there ways to aestheticize war in an acceptable way? What role does empathy and sympathy play? The author interviews one participant, recalling his own personal experience several years after the trip.","popularity":1.339,"poster_path":"/9vKgp0z2QPpVxmJ0PP2CCxUxtTT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Art Context","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
