The demise of the World Sportscar championship after the 1992 season saw a mass exodus of manufacturers to Formula One, leaving a grid shorn of much of the exotic machinery.  The lack of Mercedes-Sauber, Peugeot and others might have seemed grim at the time but on reflection the return of the GT class prompted Le Mans to rediscover its roots â€“ and created the environment for some legendary races.  In the official review of the 1994 event we see Toyota and Porsche unwilling (or perhaps unable) to completely give up on their magnificent Group C beats.  Utilising obscure loopholes in the rules Porsche had two 962s reclassified as GT1 cars while Toyota entered theirs under the new LMP1 category.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1994","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1994","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
