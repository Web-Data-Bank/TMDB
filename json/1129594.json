Danny runs a bakery in Jerusalem, founded by his father in 1929, and in a part of town that is increasingly becoming a conservative religious stronghold. His shop is popular and people come from all parts of the city to buy their Shabat bread. Khalid is a former political prisoner who learnt to make bread during his years in jail. Now his Hebron bakery is known as the best in town and is a popular treat for families on a Friday evening.\r As each character relates his experience, the stories unfold and contrast, often ironically, revealing the humanity behind the conflict; telling us new stories about the way we live, what is happening around the globe, as well as in our own neighborhoods.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dNKWdWNTT8KBpA8Ce4ifTtxOr6N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"what is happening around the globe, as well as in our own neighborhoods?","title":"Bread","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
