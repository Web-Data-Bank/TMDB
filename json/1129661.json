For one night, we follow four groups of young adults of different sociology, in the four corners of the country.  With their differences, these complementary groups draw the contours of French youth. In this film, we try to listen to their desires and their dreams, without losing the sincerity and the energy of their evenings.  A village party, a feminist collage, the last train station, a Parisian nightclub... These young people cross and overlap, dialogue and answer each other. Each group deals with a social issue and embodies a contemporary challenge.  This film is also a collective psychoanalysis, where these young people talk about their doubts, their friendships and their loves, their studies, their commitments or their work. Because Saturday night is above all a time for sharing and letting go.","popularity":2.447,"poster_path":"/4POfaBAl0fgeNlT2rsabEEght4C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47413,"logo_path":"/tWgdrvRArGnERk9lmr4IkqoiMoZ.png","name":"CAPA","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samedi soir","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
