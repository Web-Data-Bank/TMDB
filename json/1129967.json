The film begins with images of windmills on the edge of the Maas plain in a montage sequence based on the steady rhythm of the rotating sails. The focus gradually shifts towards activities on the river further upstream. The montage tempo slows down as the mechanical motion gives way to the play of reflections in the water.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1997-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maas Observation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
