This project led by the public authorities has turned into a real nightmare for the inhabitants: in the midst of empty or demolished houses and offices that are struggling to keep up with the pace of development, the Midi district has become a real paradise. To fill in, these people have been living under the threat of an \"extreme emergency\" expropriation... for 16 years. A film where the grotesque mixes with desolation, laughter with revolt.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3Yd4560w20wBIEf85aVgWBDbodj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A harmonious, coherent and revitalizing film on the \"demolition-reconstruction\" of the Midi district in Brussels","title":"Dans 10 jours ou dans 10 ans...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
