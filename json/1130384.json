John Gerbrandt, a WWII veteran, has been singlehandedly building a 7,000-square-foot house over the past three decades with nothing more than his pension and salvaged materials. With no formal training, he is fuelled by a powerful determination to prove his worth to his God, his family, and his community. John's story transcends day-to-day life in a small town and reaches the realm of deep spirituality marked by an unwavering commitment. Now at the age of 84, suffering from health problems and the financial burden of property taxes, John might not be able to finish his lifelong endeavor.","popularity":0.882,"poster_path":"/h96EDF8fCFe7zONxbtIyyURRsn7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":75168,"logo_path":"/7QhlWdkgNchV1XK194QTbFNGy6v.png","name":"TVO","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":200663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Organization of Canada","origin_country":""},{"id":181583,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balkan Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Filmed in the quaint prairie town of Herbert, Saskatchewan, Heaven or Not by filmmakers Zuzana Hudackova and Danijel Margetic is an intimate portrayal of one man's tireless journey to give his life greater meaning.","title":"Heaven Or Not","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
