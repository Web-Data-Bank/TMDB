Offshore leaks have revealed repeatedly that PEPs use British finance and British offshore jurisdictions to launder their wealth, hide their wealth and re-invest it into the global financial system. London is the place where they buy property, where they take legal action against their critics and where they live when they fall from grace. But what happens when a developing country fights back and attempts to get Britain to return the money that it claims has been stolen? Watch Behind Closed Doors and find out.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/dToztWb4bLpwyu4gaNUb1sY6RHW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Film about corruption in high places and those that enable it","title":"Behind Closed Doors","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
