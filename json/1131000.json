Based on Edogawa Rampo's novel The Black Lizard, which has had many movie and play adaptations. The Takarazuka version will be brimming over with period romance, set at the turn of the Taisho/Heiwa Eras. As the tale of thrills and suspense between the gloomy and reclusive great detective Akechi Kogorou and the master of disguise and female thief the Black Lizard (who is forever switching between western clothing and kimono) unfolds, it comes to a conclusion different from Mishima Yukio's version. Tuxedo Jazz was the associated revue show.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"明智小五郎の事件簿―黒蜥蜴 / TUXEDO JAZZ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
