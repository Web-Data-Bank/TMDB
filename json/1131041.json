Documented over the span of one year, this film tells the story of how bicycles changed the lives of people in this valley. It also illustrates how Wheels4Life works and demonstrates how others can get involved. It shows how a bicycle can get a child to a distant school, a health care worker to an ailing patient, and help a struggling individual make a living. But most importantly, this story shows how the gift of mobility can change a life. Wheels4Life, a non-profit organization founded by mountain biking legend Hans Rey, gives bicycles to people of need in developing countries.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wheels4Life","title":"Wheels4Life: The Film - A Story About Giving","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
