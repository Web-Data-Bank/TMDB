It explores life and death, the sense of place and personal displacement, and the intricate aesthetics of representation. It is a personal and spiritual film, marked inevitably by Chambers’s knowledge that he had leukemia. The late American avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage said of Hart, \"If I named the five greatest films [ever made], this has got to be one of them.\"  Even this high praise falls short of hyperbole. The Hart of London is at the centre of Chambers’s extraordinary achievement.","popularity":1.3,"poster_path":"/Al9E6DckPp7Ijjj9heogMJdWZvG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1970-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hart of London","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":12}
