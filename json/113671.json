Not far away, a woman smashes her car into a tree, only to discover her leg is a shredded bloody stump. Hot on her heels is a faceless ghoul hell-bent on burying his axe in her skull. A tussle ensues during which bullets are fired and limbs are lopped off. Meanwhile, the young couple gets dressed and wipes the fog from their windows; only then do they become aware of the gory melee that occurred not ten paces from their vehicle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":68618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aquarius Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quartered at Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
