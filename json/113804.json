They go frame by frame though the footage of the fight to break the details of the attack, and place them in the context of what they know about the way these animals act. Along the way, Kuenkel and Packer make some stunning revelations about the dark relationship between lions and cheetahs, and perhaps finally explain one of the last great African wildlife mysteries.","popularity":1.123,"poster_path":"/5y6RYnBROHYqKRBbwaHu7qKLwWj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cat Wars: Lion vs. Cheetah","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
