Of those seven, five in particular use the acting technique known as Method to delve into their own memories, impulses, anxieties, fears, fantasies and inner resources to create a series of individual performance vignettes, their personal ‘end scenes’, that reveal with particular intensity and clarity who they really are deep down – or who, in another version of their lives, they might easily have been.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/p3imI713izemZENHp0w7DaE3Fn1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self Made","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
