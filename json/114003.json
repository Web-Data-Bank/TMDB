But that's just a legend... or is it? It's a holiday weekend on the Jersey Shore and, unbeknownst to anyone, underwater drills have attracted dozens of albino bull sharks to the pier. When a man goes missing, TC (The Complication), Nookie and friends fear the worst and plead with the police chief to close down the beach. It isn't until a famous singer is eaten alive during a performance on the pier that the shark hunt begins. Now, the Preppies must work together with the Guidos in order to save the Jersey Shore and its inhabitants from another vicious slaughter.","popularity":7.958,"poster_path":"/iXICsou2NwPuIrcCyap0bpUxcSR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6677,"logo_path":"/iYfrkobwDhTOFJ4AXYPSLIEeaAT.png","name":"Syfy","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jersey Shore Shark Attack","video":false,"vote_average":5.208,"vote_count":36}
