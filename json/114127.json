The show was part of the tour to support the band's second studio album, Bridge Across Forever.  In keeping with the tradition of covering a classic progressive rock epic on each release, Live In Europe features the band running through The Beatles' Abbey Road medley as part of the intentionally Beatle-esque \"Suite Charlotte Pike.\" Rather than being a straight cover version, each section of \"Suite Charlotte Pike\" is juxtaposed with a section of the Abbey Road medley.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/e7dlX8T4e53SZxKHPdpZcLAq4Sk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inside Out Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transatlantic - Live in Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
