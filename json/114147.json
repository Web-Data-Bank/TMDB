This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .  One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .  A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture . I'm very happy with the music , however .  Worth a spin for those fans of this influential band .","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":"/p7Fh0zqjJ8wAJVywsik5LnH5BqQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roxy Music - The High Road","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
