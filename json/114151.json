Drella was a nickname for Warhol coined by Warhol Superstar Ondine, a contraction of Dracula and Cinderella, used by Warhol's crowd. The song cycle focuses on Warhol's interpersonal relations and experiences, with songs falling roughly into three categories: Warhol's first-person perspective (which makes up the vast majority of the album), third-person narratives chronicling events and affairs, and first-person commentaries on Warhol by Reed and Cale themselves. The songs on the album are, to some extent, in chronological order.","popularity":1.376,"poster_path":"/advdrJTZTmK3qBwfv8MDBVPqsDx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Channel 4 Television Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":88121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sire Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Songs for Drella","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":8}
