In this other reality the Second World War had never occurred, mankind had not yet traveled into Space and Mt. Everest had not yet been conquered, just to name a few things. Also in this other reality he is no longer a scientist but rather a well known author. After a personal tragedy in this alternate world, he finds himself back in his own world and desperately trying to locate the woman he fell in love with in the other world. Little does she know, however, that her life depends on him finding her.","popularity":1.668,"poster_path":"/7OAnmk1X2xucLHTfsKWRM3ShD9m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1847,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adder","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He had seen her, felt her touch, knew she existed...","title":"Quest for Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.727,"vote_count":11}
