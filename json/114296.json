Experiencing rejection. Hating your parents. Hating the world around you. Discovering what's hot. Discovering what's cool. Discovering your first true love. Discovering who you are. Growing up can be such a wild time. But not when you've got the best guys to hang out with. Five chaste young men immerse themselves in the superficialities and superfluity of adolescence over the course of their last year in high school. But as they make their gradual transition from boyhood to manhood, they realize it is their formidable bond that stands as the real deal.","popularity":1.01,"poster_path":"/CqoZIvfMmyKzLpA7p5QlSkcpi1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8356,"logo_path":"/z4Rv1ryUZMaGJwcaPD5nEvpOIDq.png","name":"Viva Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1984-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bagets","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
