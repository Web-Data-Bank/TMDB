In Minnesota, 250 family farms are being repossesed each week; men and women talk about their farms, the nature of their bank loans, the onslaught of corporate farming, and their sorrow and despair. In cities where 3,500 jobs per day go overseas, unemployed workers contemplate their options. The newly homeless talk about the jobs they've lost, \"Justice Ville\" in Los Angeles (bulldozed by court order), and squatting in New York's abandoned buildings. A family living in a welfare hotel tells their story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5iWdjpovH391tfyve80xOsoh5cS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":87693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joseph Feury Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The origins of homelessness.","title":"Down and Out in America","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
