As Bagnato and Rehberg dig deeper, they find these practices at non-profit hospitals around the country.  When these discoveries are made public, Bagnato and Rehberg become the targets of threats and intimidation, and are eventually prosecuted by local authorities for blowing the whistle on the hospital's practices.
