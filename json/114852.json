Her father, the cowardly King Arnold III is counting on the money this marriage will bring him. The country is now almost bankrupt because of the king's gambling debts. As Harris and the king look forward to their illusory profits from the royal merger, other characters add some liveliness to the otherwise predictable story.","popularity":1.828,"poster_path":"/w5TPKjJB9XWg5dDGtxzBoBSRuPx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":582,"logo_path":"/bEORFnCh6xQ3oQuY6yX6mRRCLvW.png","name":"Hachette Première","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":114229,"logo_path":null,"name":"M.G.
