In more recent years, Akihabara has evolved into a full-blown Mecca for computer enthusiasts, anime and manga fans, doll or \"figure\" collectors, video gamers and \"Otaku\" of all kinds. Because Akihabara caters to interests outside of mainstream Japanese society, it captivates an entire subculture of devotees. Join us as we peruse the shops, streets and Maid Cafes to present an engrossing day in the life view of Akihabara, and focus on the unique people who are passionately plugged into this town.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/vQtN47XOfnV55nX2ayFQSx1Q1PB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11376,"logo_path":"/lrglrxyGOMRl9KCsmcjmzjjpT2H.png","name":"NHK Enterprises","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Look into the life of Japan's obsessed...","title":"Akihabara Geeks","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
