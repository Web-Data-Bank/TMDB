Could this seething resentment be something as simple as envy, or have the denizens of this worldly metropolis truly done something to offend their embittered fellow countrymen?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's All Hate Toronto","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
