A no-frills hard-nosed CIA agent under normal circumstances... a furious, unrelenting crime killer when rubbed the wrong way. Forced into an early retirement for a bit of overly - destructive police work, Zeus must sit by and watch as a crime syndicate wages war against drug enforcement agents and makes a laughing stock of the intelligence community. Only one man can turn the tables in this unholy war. The FBI enlists Zeus as an undercover agent. Only this time, he is given free rein to use any and all methods at his disposal. Like a man possessed, Zeus throws his entire arsenal of wit, weaponry and vengeance into his job.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/jTWxiUUhN11yv4r1Ctyxu5l0cqt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The war has just begun.","title":"Crime Killer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
