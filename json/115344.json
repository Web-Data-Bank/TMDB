After 9/11, Key was sent to the Iraq war, despite the fact that he could have dodged his deployment by revealing his sexual orientation to his superiors.  Having returned home with shattered ideals and broken hearted by what he had witnessed, Key turned his experiences into a riveting one-man play. SEMPER FI, through its powerful juxtaposition of interviews, voiceovers, Jeff's personal footage from Iraq and scenes from his play, showcases his journey revealing the power and dignity of what it means to be a gay American at war.","popularity":1.456,"poster_path":"/7vdfWu2jZCE83ZBRmBl6RY7ARG5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Semper Fi: One Marine's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
