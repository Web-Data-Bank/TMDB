Napoleon Bonaparte, surrounded by enemies, is about to play his definitive part in history. He has spent his whole life creating a mystique, becoming synonymous with determination, strength and mystery. But, that whole super-leader trip is smothering him and he just can't stand it anymore. Meanwhile, one of his aides, le maréchal Hugo Armani, has only one dream: to emulate the man who is his idol, his emperor. Armani picks the battle of Waterloo as the moment for his borderline psychotic attack - the first case of Napoleonic delirium in modern psychiatry. Due to the shortage of maréchals at the moment, Napoleon's got no choice: he has to leave Armani in command. Unbalanced Armani, so unexpectedly promoted, now leads the troops of France.","popularity":1.503,"poster_path":"/3w0KnaTwmpyIHKROeDRNhWGuTVM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27196,"logo_path":"/BQMN3MdMZWWab8Yn1IWl4N7a4c.png","name":"Ciné B","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7396,"logo_path":"/jnjLKDfdAfNylfVdybY9370Ybrg.png","name":"Pathe","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kino Visión","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2000-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sabotage!!","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
