It will cast a new light on our contemporary system of imprisonment whilst revealing our changing attitudes to crime over the ages. In a time of credit crunch and economic crisis, Piers eye-opening exploration of debt will show how 300 years ago punishments did not necessarily fit the crime.","popularity":1.092,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"History's Hardest Prisons: Debt And Damnation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
