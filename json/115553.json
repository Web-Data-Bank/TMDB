Filmmaker Mark Cousins, who was brought up in a Northern Irish war zone, travels to Goptapa, a Kurdish-Iraqi village of just 700 people on a tributary of the Tigris river, and tries to make a dream film about a place that is normally only portrayed in current affairs programmes. He gives the kids cameras. They make little movies about war, love, a fish that goes to a magical place, and a chicken who debates justice. Despite the production being stopped twice by the Iraqi secret police, The First Movie is about wonder and the power of the imagination.","popularity":1.302,"poster_path":"/9HSVIGo9ka2n9mMjg60Blo2PfEI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The First Movie","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":7}
