On this day, a bluff, overbearing bully, Hermann Walzer, has booked the dining room for a wedding banquet for his son Mark. There's bad blood between Berger and Walzer, so when the first course, shrimp cocktail, is off, Hermann storms out with the wedding party vowing not to pay. Franz locks the loo door, taking prisoners of the bride and Hermann's wife while he also locks the estate's outer gates, leaving Hermann and the rest outside. Walzer, a pheasant hunter, lays siege; shotguns, rifles, grenades, a shovel, and other weapons leave no one safe. Will it take death to bring these men to their senses?","popularity":1.125,"poster_path":"/585V219Duj6CKPDx3lg5kQYI7BM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Typhoon Film","origin_country":""},{"id":330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fanes Film","origin_country":""},{"id":2075,"logo_path":null,"name":"MMG Film \u0026 TV Production","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":2221,"logo_path":"/42Phs2FkPuxciSqdVU8o6dXvY1j.png","name":"Erfttal Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":198,"logo_path":null,"name":"GFP Medienfonds","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-04-21","revenue":433304,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wedding Party","video":false,"vote_average":6.067,"vote_count":15}
