In England, Marie, saying she is a chambermaid on the Titanic and cannot get a room, asks to share his room. They do, chastely; when he awakens, she is gone, but he sees her at the sailing and gets a photo of her. When he returns home, he suspects that his wife Zoe has been sleeping with Simeon, the foundry owner. Horty goes to the bar, where his friends get him drunk and he starts telling an erotic fantasy of what happened with him and Marie, drawing a larger audience each night.","popularity":3.027,"poster_path":"/mMPED3zn786jkID7TWtLPt3WMyR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10344,"logo_path":null,"name":"UGC YM","origin_country":""},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1997-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chambermaid on the Titanic","video":false,"vote_average":6.286,"vote_count":21}
