He doesn't look or talk like an athlete but make no mistake, Rockhammer is a professional athlete. \"Unflinching Triumph\" immerses the audience into the life of Philip and the underground world of Professional Staredown. From Phlip's breakout success, to his tense showdowns with Staredown legend Tony Patterson, and his confrontations with his personal demons, we're with him all the way. Philip's voyage is at times joyous, often nerve-racking and occasionally heart-breaking. \"Unflinching Triumph\" provides an illuminating look at a man we never knew and a sport we never knew existed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...you flinch and you're done.","title":"Unflinching Triumph: The Philip Rockhammer Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
