On their lunch break they go into a restaurant with their Japanese uniforms on causing the proprietor to mistake them for the real thing, and a chase ensues. The boys fall through a trap door, and into a nest of Nazi spies where they are mistaken for \"Naki\", \"Saki\" and \"Waki\", three Japanese saboteurs. The stooges try to act the part, including demonstrating acrobatics and jiu-jitsu to their hosts. When the real \"Naki\", \"Saki\" and \"Waki\" show up, the boys are exposed and impostors, but after a wild fight manage to capture all the Axis spies.","popularity":1.262,"poster_path":"/zxlQofWboK1qRZ910Hhl6XsqM7o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You'll go slap-happy when the stooges go Jap-happy!","title":"No Dough Boys","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5}
