From the early cave dwellers who first stumbled upon psychedelic mushrooms to the over 6000-year-old tradition of opium cultivation in the East to a modern pharmaceutical industry with over 24,000 drugs on the market, drugs have played a role in our lives since well before recorded human history. THE STONED AGES explores the reasons weve used drugs through the ages to heal our bodies and minds, to connect with a higher power, to feel better, for recreation, to escape, for performance enhancement, and even to prolong our lives while considering the devastating consequences that accompany the choice to use certain drugs. This fascinating, fresh, and insightful documentary will ask the question: overall, have drugs done more to help us or hurt us?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The History Channel: The Stoned Age","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
