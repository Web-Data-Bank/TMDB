Andy Lee, a tall, highly-skilled boxer-puncher and southpaw, will present the most significant test yet for Chavez. How Chavez deals with Lee in their June 16 clash in El Paso, Texas, will go a long way toward predicting if and when he will finally crawl out from the long shadow cast by his father, Julio Cesar Chavez Sr., one of the greatest boxers in history.  Make no mistake about it. Lee (28-1, 20 KOs) is a definite step up for Chavez. So much so that some have wondered why Top Rank would even take this fight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bgeASnwylLcVgjBFOG1tsxO5HkV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chavez Jr. vs Lee","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
