There he meets Greta, bartender at a Bohemian cafe, who teaches him the Kama Sutra, the naked Esther, who reads him stories, and Thérèse, his wife for three years. They split after two children; he moves to a small flat, writes pornography to pay the bills, works sporadically on a novel, espouses anarchism, and meets more women. His self-confidence grows.","popularity":2.354,"poster_path":"/mvI77EzpN5DbC6BxsEItzZxu3AM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55239,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transatlantic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1994-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sexual Life of the Belgians","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":23}
