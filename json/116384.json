Centuries after Ner De Nude's death, Angus Farnsworth, a timid Hollywood advertising man finds the magic spectacles. Overwhelmed by his newfound power, he leaves his wife and drives away in his 1927 Flint automobile to become involved in a series of rare adventures in which he is able to view women in their undergarments.
