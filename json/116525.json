Shady strip club owners, angry strippers, crass porn stars, top-of-their-game experts and 3 unknowing subjects hammer out an uncomfortable look into the soul of the porn biz. Director Lance Tracy, IMDB (Best Director, NY International Film & Video Festival, 5-Telly winner) maturely balances humor, shocking honesty, science and entertainment. Is porn really addictive? Are children being sexually exploited? Who should teach sex education? How much of responsibility should the porn industry take to provide treatment for potentially addicted customers? Is porn a healthy sexual arousal tool for consenting adults? The film explores possible answers to these hard questions, providing an unexpected conclusion.","popularity":0.766,"poster_path":"/ttnibRudGmE0Z6mAX69S1XcNbjn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adult Entertainment: Disrobing an American Idol","video":false,"vote_average":3.1,"vote_count":4}
