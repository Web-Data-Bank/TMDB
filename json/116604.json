When all of the gang except Richard and Philippe are pinched, things look grim. Plus, Richard insists that they take in a wide-eyed immigrant lad, a deaf-mute left behind in the arrests. Philippe suggests a three-person pickpocket trick, using the boy, but when that goes spectacularly badly, they hit rock bottom. Then, at the cinema, the lad finds a solution. It's time to celebrate.","popularity":1.108,"poster_path":"/c1J3GExIvB8rQWmgyxuMhRXJqrV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mozart of Pickpockets","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":17}
