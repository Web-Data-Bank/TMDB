At the hospital, his parents agree to an organ transplant and a little girl receives one of his kidneys. She is seven years old and … she is Palestinian.  Yoni (Jonathan) Jesner had come to Israel for two years’ religious studies in a yashiva. Her was a brilliant student, very religious, yet he was open to the world and was always there for others. He wanted to become a doctor, but he died at only 19, in September 2002 – a victim of a bomb attack while he travelled by bus to Tel Aviv.
