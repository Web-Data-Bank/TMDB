This thin, combative woman is already a world-wide famous artist. She defines herself as a \"visual activist\" in order to highlight her commitment to politics, to communicating ideas and to art. Her work includes: provocative nudes (like a female Mapplethorpe); young Zulu couples, dressed in traditional costumes, embracing each other; a homeless socially excluded lesbian couple; a dignified portrait of Victor Mukasa, the gay human rights leader from Uganda; wonderful shots of Zanele with her white partner. Beautiful and poetic pictures which are \"militant\" in nature since they condemn homophobia, poverty, and the public and private conflicts of a country divided between tradition and modernity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9ODLguTcxsPK8Z8CwyKgEE8XEus.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""},{"english_name":"Zulu","iso_639_1":"zu","name":"isiZulu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Difficult Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
