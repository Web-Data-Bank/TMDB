Zach will open that night for a British rocker at Whisky a Go-Go; he lives in a canyon and plays impromptu duets with a mysterious guitarist he doesn't see. Tammy is a costume designer, open to quick sex with the various rockers she works with and loved from afar by Michael, a photographer recovering from a case of the clap. His good friend is Felix, a morose, alcoholic songwriter. On hand for comic relief is Marty Shapiro, a fast-talking record producer. Getting ready for the gig at the club, Zach's performance, and the early-morning aftermath comprise the film.","popularity":3.002,"poster_path":"/j9awEAeVvMolWIAmmqTYeRyXagM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":711,"logo_path":"/tEiIH5QesdheJmDAqQwvtN60727.png","name":"Fox 2000 Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4700,"logo_path":"/A32wmjrs9Psf4zw0uaixF0GXfxq.png","name":"The Linson Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The ultimate address for a dream","title":"Sunset Strip","video":false,"vote_average":4.615,"vote_count":13}
