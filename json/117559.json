Alicia, a culture instructor, is sent to a small town \"Maravillas\", which is itself an exaggerated, but very ingenious reflection of the real Cuba. The adventures that she has there are almost as crazy and senseless as the ones lived by the other Alice (in Wonderland), reflecting the indoctrination, coercion, absolutims, and many other everyday problems in Cuban society.","popularity":1.299,"poster_path":"/7C56zrNCpugkeoUyL7HD3ULe5A4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"1991-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice in Wondertown","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
