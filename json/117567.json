The rider gathers some colleagues who disguise themselves as soldiers and who take the paper to a bank. They get the money but a shoot-out occurs, an old woman is killed, and the gang acrimoniously splits up. Later some members of the gang meet up with some real U.S. Cavalry soldiers and together they must fight off new Indian attacks.","popularity":1.362,"poster_path":"/p03XwK0NN4f5vVfZDpWMz8rXXsx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5779,"logo_path":"/tGITNHYaqbnnqM8u5QK6Aw9lnWg.png","name":"Comptoir Fran√ßais du Film Production (CFFP)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8946,"logo_path":null,"name":"Achille Piazzi Produzioni Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1185,"logo_path":null,"name":"Protor Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1964-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road to Fort Alamo","video":false,"vote_average":5.577,"vote_count":13}
