The manner of their deaths, the radicalness of their slogans (they were the first overtly anti-American statements to be heard in public since the conclusion of the Korean War) deeply shocked Korean society at the time. Twenty years have since passed. The world has changed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Past is a Strange Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
