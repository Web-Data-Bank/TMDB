In 1986, the right won the legislative elections and he became Prime Minister. After two years of tough cohabitation, François Mitterrand was re-elected in 1988. After a moment of despondency, the Chirac machine started up again. During the referendum on Maastricht, he took a position for the \"yes\", against the vast majority of his party. In March 1993, the opposition led by Chirac won a crushing victory. Edouard Balladur became Prime Minister. In 1995, Jacques Chirac was elected President of the Republic: thirty years of political life found their fulfillment.","popularity":0.911,"poster_path":"/wneKHFvti3o5DNcQ4kgt62zlbS6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55216,"logo_path":"/pyDDOSzQdVQU5F69qBOgtCn8q9J.png","name":"Kuiv Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chirac","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
