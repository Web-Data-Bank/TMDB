Yul and the other prisoners kidnap an ambulance and head into the Arabian desert with the police in hot pursuit. All the performances are magnificent: Sal Mineo showing his acting talents, Jack Warden in a wiseguy performance as an employee of Zahrain oil who was involved in embezzlement, Anthony Caruso as a slimy psychotic and the underrated Madlyn Rhue as a nurse who becomes emotionally involved in the proceedings.","popularity":3.79,"poster_path":"/kVatRUPSa5nkNrbn6ZX8SWPeW3o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Escape to Explosive Adventure!","title":"Escape from Zahrain","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":20}
