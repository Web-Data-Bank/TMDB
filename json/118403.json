The concert is not a compilation of performances, but rather one complete show, exactly as Michael performed it for Prince Charles, Princess Diana and the 72,000 fans who were in the audience for that night’s sold out show. The DVD was sourced from Michael Jackson’s personal VHS copy of the performance as shown on the JumboTrons during the concert. This footage was only recently unearthed and is the only known copy of the show to exist. The visuals have been restored and the audio quality enhanced so that fans can share in the excitement of that famous night.","popularity":5.167,"poster_path":"/6XprBGQqK3s5bfN05mPyeQ0WFVC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael Jackson - Live at Wembley July 16, 1988","video":true,"vote_average":8.6,"vote_count":42}
