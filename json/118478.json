In Jacobs' own words: \"I wish more stuff was available in its raw state, as primary source material for anyone to consider, and to leave for others in just that way, the evidence uncontaminated by compulsive proprietary misapplied artistry, \"editing\", the purposeful \"pointing things out\" that cuts a road straight and narrow through the cine-jungle; we barrel through thinking weâ€™re going somewhere and miss it all. Better to just be pointed to the territory, to put in time exploring, roughing it, on our own. For the straight scoop we need the whole scoop, or no less than the clues entire and without rearrangement. O, for a Museum of Found Footage, or cable channel, library, a shit-museum of telling discards accessible to all talented viewers/auditors. A wilderness haven salvaged from Entertainment.\"","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/oBslNyp4Z2UM9vWzcN5SDVPl5s5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perfect Film","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
