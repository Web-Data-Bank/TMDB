Proving this to be the case is difficult, however, as it is generally accepted that as those who are 'profoundly retarded' cannot communicate, therefore they cannot think.  In the case of Annie O'Farrell (Tina Arhondis), finding a way for her to 'talk', other than speaking or writing, finally shows that she is not only able to think, but is highly intelligent. The battle against the hospital to acknowledge this in a legal sense goes to court, as the psychiatrists try to hide their misdiagnosis.","popularity":1.234,"poster_path":"/2ZCsC1j2M6TwqXFDmh0uR1sRv8a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annie's Coming Out","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":10}
