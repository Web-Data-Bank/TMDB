His work seems to be missing one key ingredient: half-nude chicks. In an effort to cure his writer's block (and get some much needed inspiration), Dick rents a room from a couple of women who waste no time hitting on him. Talk about invoking the muse! This lighthearted romp won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/hu7rjOAIjgkuNkXV4nADTEqgxV1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trouble with Dick","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
