Mograbi offers a powerful, at times chilling, lament of the continuing cycles of violence rooted in the past and threatening to engulf everyone's future. With the roots of so much real-world conflict left unexamined by today's restless media, this film reminds us just how vital filmmakers like Avi Mograbi are.  Documentary today is rarely immersed in questions of this magnitude - or tackles them with the level of eloquence shown here by Mograbi. An exceptional and challenging film.","popularity":0.771,"poster_path":"/cIEEtKNDvZ3YSlN69b4WnoltR65.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avenge But One of My Two Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
