Although it's short, it was billed as a main attraction. This government funded propaganda film features the classic folklore character Momotaro and his animal friends as they attack Pearl Harbor which is defended by characters strikingly similar to Bluto and Olive Oil from the Popeye cartoons. The animation is mixed with real video footage from the attack on Pearl Harbor supplied by the military.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4eXmjmYBHInHjHaijObMz2Qfwl8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Geijutsu Eiga-sha","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1943-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Momotaro's Sea Eagles","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
