Brutality is a training tool and abuse is the penalty of failure. Expectations are high and the demands made of these fighting men are extraordinary. Few can endure the ferocious rigors of military training, but everyone knows that to succeed they must find a way to cope. Soldiers come to rely upon each other for their very survival. Bonding among men is the key to unit cohesion--and the most important aspect of military training. It is the job of the drill sergeant to take civilians and turn out war machines. Through coercion, threat, abuse, and reward, drill sergeants take their GRUNTS thru the paces, teaching them the skills needed to survive on the battlefield. GRUNTS is the story of these men--of sergeants and soldiers who do what it takes to get what they want.","popularity":0.947,"poster_path":"/clH8IirzkU59MewY61sjRhS5W5Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6487,"logo_path":"/8fKr8tMwQuRNEb9a5y5gniFFZme.png","name":"Raging Stallion Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":195,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GRUNTS: The New Recruits","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2}
