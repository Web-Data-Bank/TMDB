This is the whole story - believe it or not, but director and writer Simon Verhoeven made a movie with a runtime of 88 Minutes based on this story. Low budget, but great fun. Nice pictures of Munich, good and intelligent ideas (Floh and Marcel are playing football, while Werner Hansch, a famous german TV-Sport-Presenter, reports their game to the audience)make the movie worth to be seen. Not a revolution, but, as said, it's fun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bNongp0tzcQmTqdjYU8SR1F5wBm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sentana Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":1758,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tatfilm Produktionsges. mbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Heut' Nacht geht was...","title":"100 Pro","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
