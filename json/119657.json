At the early age of 12, he witnessed the death of his father at the hands of local military authorities, during a well-meant attempt to hand-over a package of drugs he had incidentally found at sea while fishing. As a result of this experience, Julian develops a thirst for revenge that leads him to kill all those involved in his father's death. In the process he becomes a major drug lord and a very powerful headman within Dominican society.","popularity":1.206,"poster_path":"/d9QZi1QppknaybAabCYcRelrCh2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"}],"release_date":"2012-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Rey de Najayo","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
