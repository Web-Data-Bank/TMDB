Martin Beck and his police team initially suspect a highly criminal MC-leader of the attack, but one pretty soon has to re-evaluate the case once the MC-leader is found murdered in a similar wooden box. Soon, more wooden boxes are found and the police realize that they are part of a cat and mouse game with a crazy serial killer. The investigation soon shows that there is a vague connection between the victims in the shape of a 9 year old event, but what Martin Beck does not suspect is that his own life too is at stake, as the murderer has chosen him as the next victim.","popularity":1.018,"poster_path":"/uhBEqO1W7gWK6iPqWX4bWAXT5X4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beck 26 - Buried Alive","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":20}
