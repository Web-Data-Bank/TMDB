After her father's death, she's cut herself off: leaving teaching - she now temps as an office assistant, ignoring her mother's calls, talking to herself in mirrors, and rejecting any offered intimacy. She's watched over by comic extraterrestrial beings whom we see as cartoon squiggles. They ensure that random acts bring her connections - with a neighbor boy, his mother, and his surreptitious piano teacher (the lad wants to surprise his mom). She also meets an elevator operator in the building where she temps for Ms. Hadaway, a widow with perfect diction. Can Mona take a few steps on the road to expressing emotion?","popularity":1.194,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Toe Tactic","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
