Joe status quo, boldly remixed and reassembled the toys of their parent's generation. Birthing a new format of toy and medium of artistic expression, these artists were the first to explore The Vinyl Frontier. A world where Art is Fun! By exploring a landscape inhabited by a wide range of artists, their creations, and obsessive collectors, the documentary examines the hybrid objects' artistic and commercial value, as well as the creative process of art-toy making. The Vinyl Frontier is a comprehensive look at a fresh and exciting art movement that anyone young at heart and imaginative can enjoy.","popularity":0.903,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exploring the world of vinyl toys","title":"The Vinyl Frontier","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2}
