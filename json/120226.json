He also dreams about these assaults, and he's unclear how much of what he's done is real and how much is fantasy. He ignores his heroin-using wife, Vicki, who tries everything she can think of to get his sexual attention. Howard and Vicki go separately to a costume party where she learns the full truth about his nature and where he is stalked by one of his recent victims. Individualized versions of Hell await Howard and Vicki.","popularity":1.237,"poster_path":"/kKF08prcLmGHCsqoNxkblAOUwHh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45678,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lamb-Garden","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mondo Keyhole","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
