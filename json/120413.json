Keith Andes plays an ex-Communist who is strongarmed into cooperating with the Feds. Pretending to become a \"comrade\" again, Andes rejoins the local Communist cell. Moving about freely, he is able to track down a gang of spies who are smuggling atomic secrets. Filmed on location in New York, Project X has the surface \"feel\" of a documentary, though the dialogue is strictly from the funny papers. Keep an eye out for a very young Jack Lord.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She's Bait!","title":"Project X","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
