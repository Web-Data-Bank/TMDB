OTHERS TAKE ONE. Takeover! follows Full Service--a hungry and determined independent band from Austin, TX--as they embark on an experiment called the 'Takeover Tour'; a 16-city tour of amphitheater parking lots. Uninvited and unknown, they follow national acts 311 and Snoop Dogg, playing unsanctioned shows for tailgaters outside the venues. What starts as a strategic plan to boost their fan base quickly turns into a test of the very character and heart of the band itself. As they battle police, venue security, equipment failures and each other, they learn just how far they are willing to go to live the dream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Takeover!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
