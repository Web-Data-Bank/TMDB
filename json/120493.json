These six episodes take place in Dillydale where townspeople like Mr. Tickle, Miss Calamity, and Mr. Messy are busy with everything from parades and celebrations to everyday events like harvesting hay and going to the mall or movie theater. Because each character is ruled by a dominant personality trait, differences in approach and opinions are marked.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Men Show - Mr. Tickle Presents: Tickle Time Around Town!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
