Victim turns out to be Wadek Aslanian, a gangster who's viewed as a modern-day Robin Hood.  Paul, the lawyer hired by Stephane's husband, learns more than he really cares to know about his client, thanks to a series of anonymous letters. The notes provide a road map through the sordid areas of Stephane's past, allowing Paul to discover her history as an ex-prostitute, a porno movie performer -- and a frequent cohort of Aslanian.  Naturally, Stephane's husband knows nothing about her past. Just as naturally , nothing that Paul discovers keeps him from falling in love with this mysterious woman.","popularity":1.247,"poster_path":"/aYQYWUUfNgw9qXSgMCHyw66vn4f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Alain Sarde","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":25206,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sorcière Rouge","origin_country":""},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Angel","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":15}
