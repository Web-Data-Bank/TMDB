Trumpet player, friend and personal manager, Steve Schankman worked with Maynard's family and alumni musicians to develop a one of a kind tribute - a true labor of love and a celebration of Maynard's life as one of the greats in jazz history. Held September 20, 2006 at the University of Missouri-St. Louis Touhill Performing Arts Center in St. Louis, this tribute Concert brought together more than 30 alumni artists from Maynard's fifty plus years  of entertaining audiences around the world. In a manner of words, the tribute was the ultimate symphony dedicated to a man they called \"The Boss\". His dedication  to education and his pure love of sound made Maynard the kind of performer these musicians strive to be today. He is a beloved hero, entertainer, bandleader, mentor and friend whose legend will live on in every trumpet note.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Concert in tribute of the great Maynard Ferguson","title":"Maynard Ferguson: Tribute","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
