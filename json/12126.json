It's 1999 and when NATO bombs start raining down on Serbia, the two of them become refugees. After a surreal journey, they end up in New York, where Pera realizes that he can no longer do the old job he loved so much. While he and Mara were struggling to survive, the new age of digital projection was born. Then Pera stumbles upon some discarded projectors and his new mission in life becomes clear: he will travel around and show people the magic of Real Cinema - the magic that can only be created by celluoid, mechanical projectors, the silver screen and flickering light.","popularity":1.154,"poster_path":"/cMDwCXvDKrCyUbLN1bSQDWVnaDK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corazón International","origin_country":""},{"id":6266,"logo_path":"/cKEYr7wwstX4p6PrelqNuEvmgXA.png","name":"Mythberg Films","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":11010,"logo_path":"/lYQDiCx6qUJbatstiq51JHl6hbg.png","name":"Paprika Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":60619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yalla Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2013-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mama's Boy","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6}
