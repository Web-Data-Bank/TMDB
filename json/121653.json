Mingus said of himself \"I am half black man, half yellow man, but I claim to be a Negro. I am Charles Mingus, the famed jazz musician--but not famed enough to make a living in America.\" His statement summed up the conflict that plagued this musical genius his entire life: volatility, pain, prescience, and raw rage roiled inside a complex man, composer, bass player, and trombonist who transcended labels and refused to be pigeonholed into a single musical style--and who did not achieve real fame until late in his career.","popularity":0.949,"poster_path":"/dpxLLZD0Z3CmhYtgCiwsHewC2VH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A thorough, poignant profile of jazz legend Charlie Mingus.","title":"Charles Mingus: Triumph of the Underdog","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
