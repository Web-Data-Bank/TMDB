Filmed in Europe 15 years apart, these two shows seen together provide an overview of Baker’s illustrious career. The first show is a haunting 1964 performance in a Belgian TV studio with a quartet including long-time sidemen saxophonist Jacques Pelzer and French pianist Rene Urtreger. Songs include the Miles Davis classic, “So What,” and the jazz standard “Time After Time” (a very rare rendition featuring Chet’s “Cool” vocal style.) The soulful1979 set from Norway, with a trio featuring vibraphonist Wolfgang Lackerschmid, highlights the growth and maturity of this troubled but inspiring artist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ssPFfIIqj9CYOkVqWqVFE6OBmS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jazz Icons: Chet Baker Live in '64 & '79","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
