With a special and surprise guest appearance by sax legend Wayne Shorter as an added inspiration, this program shows Bobbyï¿½s unlimited creative resourcefulness and illustrates how and why he received two Grammy Awards in 1986.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobby McFerrin: Spontaneous Inventions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
