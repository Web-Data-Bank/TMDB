Interviews with bandmates reveal that the Turtles were genuinely \"Happy Together,\" enjoying their popularity without the ego hassles that plague so many bands. It wasn't all fun and games, but even the \"Lawsuits\" chapter provides a hilarious primer on the hazards of rock & roll. Best of all, the Turtles' hits (including \"She's My Girl,\" \"Elenore,\" and many more) are seamlessly combined with rare concert footage, TV appearances, and promotional films.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/3UxDtzlMG6CuD2e4ohAfRWnkK0v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunset Post","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Turtles: Happy Together","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
