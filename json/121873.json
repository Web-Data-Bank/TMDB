Her work instantly provokes a furious scandal, and Arendt stands strong as she is attacked by friends and foes alike. But as the German-Jewish émigré also struggles to suppress her own painful associations with the past, the film exposes her beguiling blend of arrogance and vulnerability — revealing a soul defined and derailed by exile.","popularity":9.145,"poster_path":"/kB4hUbhIYmx7Xdpo1DGn15pstO3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":393,"logo_path":"/48DbAqzDc1ivGZrwGG2UAR70c0W.png","name":"MACT Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions de l'Amour Fou","origin_country":""},{"id":23406,"logo_path":"/BTYR4mdM8dQxK0cK0gPVhkXd8j.png","name":"Heimatfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2012-09-11","revenue":717205,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Her ideas changed the world","title":"Hannah Arendt","video":true,"vote_average":6.947,"vote_count":246}
