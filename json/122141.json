It took place on January 24, 1988 at the Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario. Unlike the subsequent Royal Rumble events, this event was not shown on pay-per-view and was instead a television special shown on the USA Network.  The main event was a two out of three falls match where The Islanders (Haku and Tama) defeated The Young Stallions (Paul Roma and Jim Powers). The undercard featured the first-ever Royal Rumble match which was won by Jim Duggan, Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki) defeated The Glamour Girls (Judy Martin and Leilani Kai) in a two out of three falls match for the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship and Ricky Steamboat defeated Rick Rude by disqualification.","popularity":2.599,"poster_path":"/qteliXkCba0Qko6YpvgMCGm2OYA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13651,"logo_path":"/rVJkMs9cSaE1BQoPiDcH6OxmaVZ.png","name":"WWE Home Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Partners... 19 Opponents","title":"WWE Royal Rumble 1988","video":true,"vote_average":6.885,"vote_count":13}
