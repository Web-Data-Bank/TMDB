Τhe Great Love Songs is series of ten poems by, among others, Sappho, Elytis, Myrtiotissa, Sarantari, and cavafy, put to music by Manos Hadjidakis. In the film, the camera lens illustrates the emotions stirred by the erotic atmosphere of the music. We follow the camera as it wanders through Athens; the nostalgic Athens of yesteryear; the big modern-day city; the Athens of lovers; the Athens of tourists. Our journey through the city is intercut with footage from the studio recordings of the songs, while there also scenes featuring the film crew. The film is a game between image and sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Love Songs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
