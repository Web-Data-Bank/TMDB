A diaristic montage full of glimpses, glances, decaying ephemera and elliptical narrative. An abstract crime film and, like many other crime films involving larceny, a sensorial exploration of the virulence of unfettered capitalism. An impressionistic collage film culled from a wide variety of image and sound sources that fully exploits the hieroglyphic essence of cutouts to ponder what appropriation and stealing have in common. Definitely the longest continuous film I’ve ever created.—Lewis Klahr","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pettifogger","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":4}
