The film highlights Bruch's obsessive behavior regarding his training and preparations. Facing difficulties with the Swedish Olympic Committee, Bruch is denied the right to compete in the Olympic Games. Bent on revenge, he trains like an animal and competes in smaller competitions, ultimately throwing his career-best 71.26 meters (233 feet, 9 inches). Proving to himself and the world that he is the greatest, Ricky's throw would have won the 1984 Olympics by nearly 5 meters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p7QFCBPMhGw9Hda3iryCWfbYnki.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemagi/Folkets Bio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1985-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Soul Is Greater Than the World","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
