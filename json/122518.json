Eventually, as a surrogate father, he takes in a wild young girl (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi) and a particularly strong bond is formed between these two rootless people. Márta Mészáros’s remarkable movie starring Jan Nowicki and Anna Karina is about displacement, loneliness and attachment.","popularity":1.979,"poster_path":"/opyfrZ0hwvIsZfCZa4X7M3Ou9mw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hunnia Filmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":56048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dialóg Filmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1978-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Like at Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
