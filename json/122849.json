Desperate to make ends meet, he accepts a job as a caretaker of an abandoned property in Quezon City. Ruben soon finds out that the previous owner of the house is an important figure in the country’s history. When he is interviewed by a TV reporter about this historical figure, Ruben feels embarrassed that he knows nothing about him.  Ruben soon starts reading up to get to know more about the life of this person, his accomplishments and what he has done for the people. Ruben’s fascination about the person’s life and his inevitable hero-worship irks the only friend he has in the sprawling compound, the night-shift security guard, Gimo, who jokes that Ruben is slowly being possessed by the soul of his new hero.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3CEzCDPjRIBuA7fh3J5RJ99BTep.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemalaya Foundation","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":165337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Breaking the Box Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":58347,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bigtop Media Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":8355,"logo_path":null,"name":"APT Entertainment","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An ordinary man haunted by an extraordinary legacy.","title":"Ang Katiwala","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
