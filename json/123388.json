This episodic comedy is set in the small town of Mestecko (which literally translates to \"small town\") right before the Velvet Revolution of 1989.  Tonda (Vlastimil Brabec) leads an ensemble cast of townsfolk who are eager to experience capitalism, but are unaware of how it's supposed to work. They set out to pull get-rich-quick schemes and end up creating their own version of free enterprise. For instance, a group of men run for office as a political party called the\"Independent Eroticists\" so they can hire a stripper to perform for the town. Individual business owners plot various schemes in order to participate in the new economy as the town heads into the '90s","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":48595,"logo_path":null,"name":"S Pro Alfa","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":14778,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemasound","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2003-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Town","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
