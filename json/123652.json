Obsessed with Amr, the handsome actor he discovered and cast as his alter-ego in parts one and two of The Alexandria Trilogy, Yehia pressures Amr to star in various film projects that change even as Yehia's perception of the young actor begins to change. He first casts Amr as Hamlet, which the actor deems too demanding for his talents, then as the lead in a musical biopic of demigod Alexander the Great, who founded the city of Alexandria in 332 B.C.","popularity":2.138,"poster_path":"/p55iCAyRWFlzbb8m13g18VX17Cg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11574,"logo_path":null,"name":"MISR International Films","origin_country":"EG"},{"id":115413,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paris Classics Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1990-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alexandria Again and Forever","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":8}
