This harrowing drama concentrates on the deviations of legal and moral definitions when two opposing cultures clash. Although fictional, this was one of the earliest films to deal realistically with life and death in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the Second War.","popularity":1.722,"poster_path":"/aQ0Bj6uI3Ei2TyRjgb3sEQUU2II.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1314,"logo_path":"/gQBluDqe6dc2ZdzfJbabEHoSGoG.png","name":"Hammer Film Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1958-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is not just a story - it is based on brutal truth","title":"The Camp on Blood Island","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":19}
