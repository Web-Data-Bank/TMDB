They spent between 6 and 13 years in prison before a serial rapist confessed that he alone had committed the crime, leading to their convictions being overturned. Set against a backdrop of a decaying city beset by violence and racial tension, this is the story of that horrific crime, the rush to judgment by the police, a media clamoring for sensational stories and an outraged public, and the five lives upended by this miscarriage of justice.","popularity":6.06,"poster_path":"/aKlQ8Sjr07OkCLuYkRYtpVSMm3e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10725,"logo_path":"/rLfwt5kPoXfJweOsEDgJhhBnN7Q.png","name":"WETA","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10722,"logo_path":"/mPJs7G32jMVmgUlcuobZelsjkhv.png","name":"Florentine Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-05-24","revenue":273747,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Central Park Five","video":false,"vote_average":7.011,"vote_count":92}
