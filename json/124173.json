Only when he arranges for her teenage son Matthew to be enrolled in the same boarding school without consulting her, she leaves, only to find he obtains custody and she stands no chance of contesting it without a steady job. New York star photographer Leo Purbright takes her on as factotum, perhaps a shot at a real career, but his jealous assistant adds to the practical problems to square work with Matthew's present needs, miserable as bully Tommy's picked target.","popularity":1.113,"poster_path":"/pZ7XptQjfHFyxDJDCssMNb8j4P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1941,"logo_path":"/6yvtjS2R9yJRItWbGYsCEMVZGON.png","name":"Network Movie","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katie Fforde - Harriets Traum","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
