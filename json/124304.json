The mother not only provides a rich childhood for her daughter, she erases any clues her daughter might see that would lead her to think she is different (mother burns books such as \"Snow White\" and destroys lawn statues of gnomes). In short, she doesn't want to talk about it. The mother succeeds in creating a modern-day Rapunzel: Charlotte becomes an accomplished young woman who captures the heart of Ludovico. But then, the circus comes to town.","popularity":1.27,"poster_path":"/sMdl025aldu01XzMsi0LUGjX0r4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oscar Kramer S.A.","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":37353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aura Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":37354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mojame S.A.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1993-05-20","revenue":249530,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Don't Want to Talk About It","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":6}
