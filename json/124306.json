Over ten months, we follow the mad Artaud from his cruel coaching of an actress in his \"theatre of cruelty\" to his semi-friendship with Prevel who buys him drugs and hangs on his every word. Meanwhile, Prevel divides his time between Jany, his blond, young, drug-hazed mistress, and Rolande, his dark-haired, long-suffering wife, who has a child during this time. Cruelty, neglect, poverty, egoism, madness, and the pursuit of art mix on the Left Bank.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/lQQ8odh4KuXaKGOBuVSGrAIoGim.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archipel 33\u003e35","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":153395,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":47608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laura Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Life and Times with Antonin Artaud","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":9}
