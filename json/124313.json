(It may date to their mother's leaving the family.) Martin is philosophical, romantic, and poetic: he dreams of being the son of a shark; he holds tight to a book about goldfish his mother gave him. In both halting and wild ways, he tries to court Marie, a neighbor girl. Simon, with a pocketknife and an intractable will, seems more dangerous to others. What, on earth, is there for these children-becoming-men?","popularity":1.055,"poster_path":"/fXCxdqyDnPz0wcXrep4fduVOKKj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95456,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Visible Films","origin_country":""},{"id":47058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie des Images","origin_country":""},{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":70449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Première Heure","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2208,"logo_path":"/jpQzLl4HPsVc7tnbibETwHbdjWb.png","name":"RTL-TVi","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":859,"logo_path":"/wK6ssskf1QaGp057lSYb6fa3Nwc.png","name":"Saga Film","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"1993-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Son of the Shark","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":6}
