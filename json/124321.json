The film explores how the socially-conscious folk rock of young hippies with acoustic guitars was transformed into the coked-out stadium excess of the late 1970s and the biggest selling album of all time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m84CwB1T6aoEspR9bAnGTqJtaBL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel California: LA from The Byrds to The Eagles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
