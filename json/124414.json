The outskirts here are a Slovakian town in the Tatra Mountains. Though censored for 17 years, Dusan Hanáks poetic visual essay is not a political or even social film. It goes to far deeper and more fundamental levels of human experience. Inspired by the photographs of Martin Martinek, the films power lies in its unusual portraits of people whose raw visual beauty radiates from their very souls.","popularity":1.369,"poster_path":"/pGDQSKebiD9QEzypQwhNFsMGvid.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slovenská filmová tvorba Koliba (SFT)","origin_country":"XC"},{"id":18370,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slovenský film Bratislava","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1972-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pictures of the Old World","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":21}
