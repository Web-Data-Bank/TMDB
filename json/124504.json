The mysterious and obviously rich Peppino Garibaldi gives them an offer, they can’t deny: For a large amount of dough they should play “Richard III.” in the Mexican town Vera Cruz.\r But Peppino is not really interested in cultural affairs: He supports “La Revolución” and “General” Carasco, who utilizes the feastful premiere of “Richard III.” to raid Vera Cruz for Comandante Zapata. But shortly after the Mexican Army shows up with some canons in tow to sort things out.\r Guidi and Padre Albino, Italian like him, succeed to flee and save Carasco accidentially from the firing squad. Whereas the latter coninues his revolutionary fight, Guidi and Albino start an odyssey through the struggling Mexico, which lets them fall one time in the hands of Carasco the other time in those of Herrera or even in the clutches of “hand-taking” bandidos.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/zmXGkIfWYpZFPbKLLeQz1OlOdEt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fair Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Midega Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1972-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Never mind how they got into it ...wait 'till you see how they get out!","title":"What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Revolution?","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":7}
