He's serious about his part-time job as a clerk for an insurance company, and he also acts, with small parts under his belt in commercials and experimental films. An agent finds his serious innocence perfect for a part as an odd bellman. Before his screen test, he volunteers for a day at a hotel. At his screen test, his inability to see the comic center of the scene makes him perfect for the part. Back at work, women co-workers tease him, and then he's off to the countryside to play a vet in a government film about myxomatosis in rabbits. Can anything break through his serious view of reality?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/7VLiuHZO8Q2eSTpf2zMdiyyvKsg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sépia Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":2564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné-@","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Augustin","video":false,"vote_average":4.25,"vote_count":4}
