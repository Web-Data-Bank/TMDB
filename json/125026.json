During the making of this film, filmmakers uncovered new evidence of White's innocence and brought the case back to Federal Court. Holy Man offers a rare glimpse into the mysterious world of Lakota religion, their intimate connection to the land, and a provocative expose of the systemic injustice that Native Americans face in the criminal justice system.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/kGWuWC78GCFM9mKzweDg0MiouQj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome to the reservation.","title":"Holy Man: The USA vs. Douglas White","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
