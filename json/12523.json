During his lifetime, he was the most wanted criminal in Bavaria and even Prince Regent Luitpold was reported daily on the hunt for the lawbreaker report. Again and again Kneißl's story has occupied the Bavarian artists: his life was retold in folk songs and murders, sung in ballads, filmed and treated in various plays. In his feature film version, the Bavarian filmmaker Marcus H. Rosenmüller relies on a rapid staging, opulent images and a moving love story.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/hmg5tGn0xJ9W0diQwH3ChJJa4Zy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":336,"logo_path":"/4YJDtfNDyI1ustIo6KttzEuIvQz.png","name":"Wiedemann \u0026 Berg Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Räuber Kneißl","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
