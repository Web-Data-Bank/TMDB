Without witnesses or explanations, the crime appears to the police and others as a jigsaw puzzle without enough pieces. The police then suspect and arrest people based on the usual prejudices, black and coloured people who plant marijuana in this case. Meanwhile, the true assassin not only goes his way unpunished from the very beginning, but becomes one of the rural town's most respected citizens. The sheriff at one point does begin having certain suspicions, and from there on the bulk of the plot is played out. The location is a very arid part of South Africa, so with so much desert rock, there are bound to be quarries. Some may reveal important secrets.","popularity":1.35,"poster_path":"/byCCshcAAneDJu3gqjU8eA7YXHK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Quarry","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":7}
