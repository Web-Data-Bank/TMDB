Pursued by a U.S. Marshall from Utah who specializes in clown cases, they become dangerously entangled with a swindling cult leader whose truck (full of scammed cash) they have stolen to pull their trailer. It's a crazed festival of guns, puppets, blood, rubber noses and dark humor.  (By the way, none of this is nearly as interesting as it sounds.)","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's blood, drugs, bullets & greasepaint","title":"Killer Klowns from Kansas on Krack","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
