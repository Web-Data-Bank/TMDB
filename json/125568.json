When Jim runs afoul of a gang of Mexican thieves, it’s up to Billy to rescue his hero. Billy and His Pal is short on plot but long on local atmosphere with the director (probably William Haddock) and cameraman William “Daddy” Paley making the most of the starkly beautiful Texas countryside.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/16qlyvi4VVIF6p0ovRWIP2wRdao.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy and His Pal","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
