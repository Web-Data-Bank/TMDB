As he watches his peers drop dead around him - many of them amazingly from natural causes - he finds himself more and more soldiering on because that's just what bosses do. Reflecting back on his younger days in London, it is sad to contrast his current lavish - but empty - life as a crime lord in Hong Kong with the joys he experienced as a petty thief in England. These flashbacks and voice overs give us insights not only into Yam himself, but also his closest associates, whom we discover he in truth barely knows.","popularity":2.191,"poster_path":"/xXxNiUuTOO8REDKwSCBZf8M2vC2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3029,"logo_path":null,"name":"China Star Entertainment","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":31733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Icon Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":5633,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Hundred Years of Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2000-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jiang Hu: The Triad Zone","video":false,"vote_average":6.867,"vote_count":15}
