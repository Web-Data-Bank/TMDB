Unlike his married brother who is expecting a baby, Derek is single and without a career. Although he aspires to become a graphic-animator, he works part-time at his uncle’s construction company. Late at night he wanders the street alone and frequents nightclubs in search of companionship. Derek suddenly finds himself in an intimate relationship with a woman he meets, Nicole. When a neighbourhood raccoon becomes a constant nuisance by tearing up his family’s garbage, Derek sets out to catch it.","popularity":1.018,"poster_path":"/tkU3LQ1PkWSCpFBumLrsEOVKkJY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70684,"logo_path":"/5NRl4cajjnw3cL58APB0zHZaAJS.png","name":"Medium Density Fibreboard Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tower","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5}
