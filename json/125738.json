The film follows the flight of Younes, his wife Nahila, and those around them, from their village in northern Palestine to a refugee camp in Lebanon. Some vow to continue the struggle, most simply struggle to survive. Unsparingly detailing the impact of the nakba (disaster) on Palestinian life and society and the refugees' often-contentious relationship with their reluctant Lebanese hosts, Gate of the Sun spans generations, mixing personal stories with historical events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zdNVgQl2E9CzEKuiKhDvYpRtLC2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ognon Pictures","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11574,"logo_path":null,"name":"MISR International Films","origin_country":"EG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2004-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":278,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gate of the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
