The movie covers the two month time period during 1977 when a businessman was kidnapped, and later murdered, by the left-wing terrorists known as the RAF-Rote Armee Fraktion (Red Army Fraction). The businessman had been kidnapped in an effort to secure the release of the orginal leaders of the RAF, also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang. When the kidnapping effort and a plane hijacking effort failed, the three most prominent leaders of the RAF, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, all committed suicide in prison. It has become an article of faith within the left-wing community that these three were actually murdered by the state.","popularity":2.738,"poster_path":"/c647fe1s7gpjaHYY5ccl54K7mFA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30659,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABS Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":11626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tango Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":21534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kairos-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Germany in Autumn","video":false,"vote_average":6.28,"vote_count":25}
