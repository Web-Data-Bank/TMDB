Noah and Zipporah marry after a brief courtship. She wants to be a singer and stalls out when she fails. He's working hard at a business that may go under. Sarah and Shane are architects; he can't handle her success at a downtown firm. Leslie is a librarian, sour and prickly; her mate, Peter, is a college teacher whose head is turned by a student. Can any of these couples sort things out and stay together? Should they?","popularity":1.233,"poster_path":"/zoMMNLI4QhwS8uABuCbECzn1U9D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"...till death do us part...","title":"Last Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
