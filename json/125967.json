The cast is as follows: An astrophysician who works alone with Geraldine in an observatory high in the mountains. He’d like to seduce Geraldine, but she seems to prefer the shepherd who’s been relegated to a shabby hut nearby. A group of filmmakers stuck in the middle of the countryside after their crew went on strike because lunch never turned up. A squadron of stupid soldiers who consider even the most minor incident to be proof of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of France. A maniacal geologist, oblivious of everything, who continues to search for the traces of a tectonic Big Bang in the most inaccessible places.","popularity":0.63,"poster_path":"/n91EFb7BgF95UwJxRg8sirH3Wvf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wrecked on Road 17","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
