Life, if it had started at all, would be in its earliest stages of evolution. Days would last four hours, winds would blow at hurricane force and there would be a dense and toxic atmosphere resembling that of Venus.  Around 50 million years after the formation of the solar system, a Mars-sized planet called Theia hit the newly formed Proto-Earth. The blast sent planetary material from the pair into orbit around earth which eventually formed the Moon.  In this one-hour special, viewers learn what Earth was like before the moon creating impact, and what Earth would have been like if the moon had never existed.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/nuuAsi26qQEnvO6QOTQgyTVbaxP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if the moon never had existed?","title":"If We Had No Moon","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4}
