Children hold chickens while an adult clips their wings; we see a forest; a narrator talks about stars and light and eternity. A dog joins the hens and the family, while the narrator explains the heavens. We see a bee up close. The narrator suggests metaphors for heavenly bodies. Scenes fade into a black screen or dim purple; close-ups of family life may be blurry. The words about the heavens, such as \"The stars are a flock of hummingbirds,\" contrast with images and sounds of real children.","popularity":1.244,"poster_path":"/iUyXNzihIgPjzZsR1vODFmJ1pQO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stars Are Beautiful","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":20}
