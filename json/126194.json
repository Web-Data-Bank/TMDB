Montages of color move rapidly with a star and the edge of a lighted moon briefly visible. Purgation is back to full frame; blurs of color occasionally slow down then freeze. From time to time, an image, such as a window or a face, is distinguishable for a moment. In \"existence is song,\" colors swirl then flash in and out of view. Behind the vivid colors are momentary glimpses of volcanic activity.","popularity":2.273,"poster_path":"/4Bl7aXAbv1peLt8NkmUr5vfkVCs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dante Quartet","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":49}
