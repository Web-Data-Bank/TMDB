When her husband Billy is killed in a senseless act of violence, Sam loses her faith and her will to live. But a death-defying encounter with two children leads to a reunion with Joe, her oldest friend. As Sam watches “Papa” Joe care for and love the kids in his under-resourced neighborhood, she begins to realize that no matter life’s circumstances, the love of God is always reaching out to us.","popularity":13.557,"poster_path":"/utD4YdrlyktHAAM7Qt7hq4UppLX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harbinger Media Partners","origin_country":""},{"id":138834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veracity Moving Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":138835,"logo_path":null,"name":"Free To Love Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not a dead end if it takes you somewhere you needed to go.","title":"Unconditional","video":false,"vote_average":6.719,"vote_count":57}
