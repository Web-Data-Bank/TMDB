He sweats the students for protection money, acquires copies of tests for a fee, and has rigged the votes so he can beat Kelly in the election for student president. Aside from his anointed acolytes, Matt is almost universally despised. His parents are obscenely rich and spend their time travelling in Europe rather than giving him the parental guidance he needs. Things begin to get ugly when some of the teens resist his power and show Matt up at the drag race.","popularity":0.978,"poster_path":"/mg2y5osbQguZVE8jIBIJ3ILsHAh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marathon Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":13733,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Filmgroup","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1960-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He had more rackets than Al Capone!","title":"High School Caesar","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
