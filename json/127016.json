Along with her are her longtime boyfriend Danny (Scott Bairstow), his best friend Jeff (Henry Thomas), and the son of an important and infinitely influential client, Marcos (Sebastian DeVicente). It probably wasn't a good idea to take three gorgeous men the same age out on a boat with a bikini-clad beauty who lately has been questioning her relationship with her main  squeeze, but it gets even worse than expected. There's tragedy, betrayal, and more tragedy as the faulty value systems of the wealthy brats spin out of control.","popularity":4.885,"poster_path":"/pVlR6kUBuPNikk7AMDv75hmD5YQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nuts and Lloyd Films","origin_country":""},{"id":40478,"logo_path":null,"name":"E.H.
