Born in Detroit in the late 80s, Techno met its audience a few years late in Europe, as the UK, Germany, France, and many other countries started to host the foundations of a Techno scene.  It is mostly focused on Paris and Berlin: Two different cities, two different tales, but Techno grew up in both, from secret underground parties to huge clubs, from a small faceless movement to an established business, and from vinyl to digital.","popularity":1.379,"poster_path":"/erPjkkPOAKT1rYcCvmXW8e4qTun.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Du Garage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris/Berlin: 20 Years of Underground Techno","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
