From the particle accelerator in Switzerland, where scientists seek to probe regions of time we cannot see, to lava flows in Hawaii which have overwhelmed all but one home on the south side of Big Island; from the disintegration of inner-city Detroit, to a Hindu funeral rite near the place of Buddha's enlightenment, Mettler explores our perception of time. He dares to dream the movie of the future while also immersing us in the wonder of the everyday.  THE END OF TIME, at once personal, rigorous and visionary, Peter Mettler has crafted a film as compelling and magnificent as its subject.","popularity":1.855,"poster_path":"/8ERn9JiYSYolNKKZRTkSEH8B8M0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grimthorpe Film","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":2083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maximage","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":182547,"logo_path":null,"name":"SRF Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen","origin_country":""},{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2012-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of Time","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":12}
