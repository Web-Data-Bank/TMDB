Amid rare footage of the most shocking and inspired street acts from around the world, one performer after another pulls back the makeshift curtain. Their acts are astonishing; their stories, more amazing still. Here is the tightrope walker, the razor blade muncher, the sidewalk samurai, the tattooed man.

This is the human condition at its most freakishly wonderful.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/7MdTn7ofp8j0XpMyFPQBysYd5Xf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buskers; For Love or Money","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
