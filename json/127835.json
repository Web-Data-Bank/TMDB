It looks behind the business-as-usual face we put on life and shows anxieties we want to forget. It is made of dozens of pictures that seem familiar, with fragments of speech heard in passing and, between times, a voice saying, \"Very nice, very nice.\" The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film.","popularity":2.049,"poster_path":"/nXRhGRgIwjulrVJMPajv1SvuR6Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79088,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kingsley International","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Very Nice, Very Nice","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":32}
