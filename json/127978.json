He is 46 years old and has no family or job. Some of his old friends have abandoned the life of crime, and policeman Leo Aleksandrs, as well as the beautiful taxi driver Irēna, try to persuade Voldis to forget the past and move on. But when the crime boss Teksis proposes a plan to rob a jewelry store, Voldis agrees, thinking this will be his last crime before starting a new life. Marking the pinnacle of its director's filmography, To Be Unwanted is a psychological drama that centers not on a single crime or its investigation but on the emotional collapse of the criminal as he realizes that his amoral lifestyle has rendered him redundant within society.","popularity":0.68,"poster_path":"/1t1QRYtNcjILhtN5HQncywB2hZx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82801,"logo_path":"/8h6Ugz5S1DiX7kaeg19eQKXsS4q.png","name":"Rīgas kinostudija","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1976-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Be Unwanted","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
