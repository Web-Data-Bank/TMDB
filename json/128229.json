Almost immediately, he is expected to marry his childhood sweetheart Priscilla... but instead, Harry's first heady whiff of manhood has got him panting after Bebe, a \"fast\" woman from the big city. Mistakenly thinking that Bebe fancies him too, Harry risks everything to help her out when she lands in jail, only to end up in hot water himself. Through it all, sweet Priscilla waits for her man to come to his senses.","popularity":0.694,"poster_path":"/gYcZxuiHvpo0JXa9lxc4oIaiAFF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harry Langdon Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Pants","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":9}
