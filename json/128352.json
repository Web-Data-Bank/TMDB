W. Paul, and directed by Walter R. Booth and was filmed at Paul's Animatograph Works. It was released in November 1901. As was common in cinema's early days, the filmmakers chose to adapt an already well-known story, in this case A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, in the belief that the audience's familiarity with the story would result in the need for fewer intertitles. It was presented in 'Twelve Tableaux' or scenes. The film contains the first use of intertitles in a film.","popularity":1.177,"poster_path":"/rRV8szmFfCU3YSrAd2A8C3UIIfB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44945,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paul's Animatograph Works","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1901-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scrooge; or Marley's Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":26}
