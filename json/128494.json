In 2002, Phyllis Diller announced that she would be hanging up her wigs and sequins after 47 years on the road. This film captures a never-before-seen, intimate look at a trailblazer for both women and comedy. Miss Diller provides unprecedented access to her preparations for her final performance at the Suncoast Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.  This is a revealing and personal study of the art of stand-up comedy as told by an icon and a true comedic genius.","popularity":0.97,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life and Legend of Phyllis Diller","title":"Goodnight, We Love You","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
