A story of courage and bravery. It is the life of José Fierro, a man who faces the consequences of his acts when he decides to go all out; of his wife Ana Luisa, who wants to experience love and eroticism beyond what is permitted. A brave movie that reflects the best and the worst of humans, but is also a tragicomedy (as is life), full of humor, hope and self-sacrifice: the reflection of a country undergoing a permanent financial crisis, produced by the Tequila effect, but which has the virtue of not letting itself be defeated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t7SDbXO9oFjWCwoNPMc5zMZD6ZT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tequila Effect","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
