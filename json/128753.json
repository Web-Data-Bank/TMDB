He rushes upstairs to inform his domineering wife, and she accuses him of being crazy and threatens to have him put away. He persists that he did see a unicorn in the garden, and she phones for the authorities to come take him away. But when they arrive, with strait-jackets, they find the wife rambling and raving about seeing the unicorn, and promptly take her away.","popularity":2.768,"poster_path":"/hsuT6j3hhRLCGc3IAepOQL5g0mn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1334,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Productions of America","origin_country":""},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A henpecked husband sees a unicorn outside his window--or does he?","title":"The Unicorn in the Garden","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":37}
