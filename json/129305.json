An observation and diagnosis of the modern Japanese metropolis: the singularity of unusual creative individuals is merely a response to the majority Japanese society. Even this can appear as an eccentric work of art. So where do the borders lie? A psychologist talks about the autistic way of life burgeoning in the dense population of the country. A noise musician speaks of her inspiration from sado-masochistic bondage as an art form.  A stirring film testimony about music and much else besides, with images spanning inconsolable anxiety and meditative tranquility. Tokyo, Noise music, S&amp;M, homosexuality, photography,... all in one bizarre but quite interesting avant-garde documentary.","popularity":0.838,"poster_path":"/bAKch9UyI48f8NoYWohQl9sKHbp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17607,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charon Film AB","origin_country":""},{"id":130607,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manden med Cameraet ApS","origin_country":""},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2002-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Noise","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
