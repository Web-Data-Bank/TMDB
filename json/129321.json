Writer-director Everett Lewis' 1973-set period piece concerns Pagan, a shirtless, pansexual, drug-addled singer-songwriter. He's smitten with hunky Donovan, probed by an ambitious journalist and drugged by an evil groupie. Unfolding as a double LP, Pretty Boys meanders from seductive and weird to wild and tender. -Gary Kramer, Instinct Magazine","popularity":1.279,"poster_path":"/iy3GiNCD3fpfBYkz0da8VveBZm9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pretty Boys","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
