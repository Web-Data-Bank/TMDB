Following a brace of songs recorded live at San Francisco's Fillmore Theatre, this selection settles into a tried and tested promo formula for half of its running time, using ghetto-real grainy footage of the moody trio stalking inner city streets. \"When the Ship goes Down\" branches out into conceptual territory with a three-minute epic concerning internecine gang warfare that breaks up the band's performance. On \"Dr Greenthumb\" they play on their Furry Freak Brothers of rap stereotype in the setting of a green-fingered General Hospital. \"(Rock) Superstar\" sees a Cypress fan winning a Willy Wonka-style ride through their Hall of Mirrors, where he is transformed into a bona fide, gold lame-wearing rock star. Set in a derelict warehouse, the hardcore romp of \"Can't Get the Best of Me\" is reminiscent of Fight Club's basement brawls.","popularity":0.872,"poster_path":"/vB9r0J6OENzgMRqNyFyGkGa2k7M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cypress Hill - Still Smokin'","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
