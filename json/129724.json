Then life intervened, with marriage and children putting an end to her racing days. Now, after a 34-year break, Rosie is making a comeback. Urged on by her daughter and self-proclaimed manager, she tries to find sponsors. The road is uneven and behind her dreams of a comeback, there are depressions, burnout and family tragedies. This film is a revealing and complex portrait of a woman who gains strength by allowing herself to be weak. The fight to become the world's fastest grandmother is really the fight to reclaim one's own life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oICGxzQ7k9yfoGzUxfyujmVnfxl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17598,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mantaray Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2011-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Motherâ€™s Comeback","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
