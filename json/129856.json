Sei in arresto","overview":"Sando Kid is a medic on the battlefields of the civil war and a pacifist. One day he witnesses Yankee captain Grayton ruthlessly killing wounded and unarmed soldiers. He manages to survive thanks to the help of a friend and learns how to use a gun. From now on, he will sign up to the rangers and hunt down bandits. He soon crosses paths with Grayton again, who now has become a ruthless business man, trying to rob farmers of their land. Together with his henchmen, Grayton might be more than Sando Kid can handle, if it wasn't for Dollar, a black-clad bounty hunter who likes to wear a chain of teeth around his neck, and really likes the Kid.","popularity":2.744,"poster_path":"/qpeOQJjSY0X2rwhvdHZdzvaO3VM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sara Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dauro Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1971-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raise Your Hands, Dead Man, You're Under Arrest","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":3}
