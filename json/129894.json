The people band together and try to get the tram back on the train tracks and head towards the city.  Along this journey the passengers encounter many people who join them on the tram. What started out as only a handful of people has now turned into a small village.  As the people travel on to the city each person takes on certain roles and through the course of time these roles will change. Some people fall in love, others out of love, and a few even die. But life goes on. The people keep the tram going hoping to reach Budapest.","popularity":1.833,"poster_path":"/rrGVgh7Htts54CAer8iZtm7wt9j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hungarofilm","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":7013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hunnia Filmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1977-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Budapest Tales","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":6}
