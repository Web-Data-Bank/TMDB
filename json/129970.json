Essentially a plotless collage of random incidents involving sex, drugs, religion and The Wizard of Oz, it was shown with an equally random soundtrack mixing “obnoxious radio advertisements, rock 'n' roll and press conferences with Lee Harvey Oswald's mother”. It was shown three times in public, but never released commercially.","popularity":0.859,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreamland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A triple projected trash epic","title":"Roman Candles","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7}
