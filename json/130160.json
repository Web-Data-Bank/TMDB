A couple escaped their family to look for a spiritual tree in the jungle. There is a song at night, a song that spoke about an innocent idea of love and a quest for happiness.  Worldly Desires is an experimental project where I invited a filmmaker friend, Pimpaka Towira, to shoot the love story by day and the song by night. The story, Deep Red Bloody Night, was written by my assistant who wanted to reprise a forbidden love story in a more romantic time in the past. I picked a pop song, Will I be Lucky? to convey a sense of guiltless freedom one feels when being hit by love. The video is a little simulation of manners, dedicated to the memories of filmmaking in the jungle during the year 2001-2005.  -Apichatpong Weerasethakul","popularity":0.991,"poster_path":"/kWX3F49rg4v6FDOKQroB1Nw9nov.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59665,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kick the Machine","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2005-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Worldly Desires","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
