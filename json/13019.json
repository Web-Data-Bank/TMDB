Matt and Kris, friends for years, want to have an only-once, no-strings good time. Abby and Andrew, married, celebrate his birthday, but it's marred by angst and miscommunication. Mia and Eric are exes, making sure they are over each other. Jaime and Ken work together and this is a first date. Inez and Gord invite his roommate, Dave, to join them. By the time each couple has gone through a prelude, foreplay, sex, an interlude, orgasm, and afterglow, they've answered basic questions: can sex be anonymous, are we bored, is our marriage really finished, does anyone tell the truth, and how do we make someone happy?","popularity":12.692,"poster_path":"/hjfXPDVjYd2yFYTKCwgEB9QEdmV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5106,"logo_path":"/UjER6i4eM9WuBCVxSSWFtMrsuT.png","name":"Copperheart Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Coming Together Has Never Been So Complicated.","title":"Young People Fucking","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":176}
