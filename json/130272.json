The usual commentary has been omitted and in its place poems and songs in Bahasa Indonesia have been included in a digital sound composition.  In Mother Dao the Turtlelike, the viewer sees how the colonial machinery in the 1920s was implanted in a world so different from Western Europe.","popularity":0.677,"poster_path":"/qdqsKoE422dLzjWblhsegdu31kb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12023,"logo_path":"/97tVKGqnkjn0hwTGGRDPRgYWbrE.png","name":"Nederlandse Programma Stichting (NPS)","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1995-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother Dao, the Turtlelike","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":10}
