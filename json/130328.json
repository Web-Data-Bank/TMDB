Indeed, so outraged are they at the changeover to communism that they harass him at every turn, especially after he treats a local barmaid as if she were a whore of some kind. After administering a beating to him, the old hands are nonetheless incensed when he calls on the police. The director doesn't get enough help, however, because the stable hands stab him before running off for the border.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i7WWDTScUL0YnapZoVgC6AKbKQV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stud Farm","video":false,"vote_average":6.571,"vote_count":7}
