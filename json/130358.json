Their subsequent white-hot, scandalous love affair gave rise to the paparazzi and they became the most hunted and photographed couple on earth. Their rocky, passionate, relationship, born in front of the cameras, was subsequently captured in a series of films, including The V.I.P.s and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The last of the great, extravagant stars, flaunting diamonds, yachts and private planes, they continually seized the headlines. They even divorced and married again - only to divorce again - but remain in each other's hearts. This Elizabeth Taylor - Richard Burton story is a no-holds barred account of their undying, but impossible love.","popularity":4.809,"poster_path":"/9zB6dpl7otnzzgJN5iXP5NNJAGN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12799,"logo_path":"/mRkrTKpJswgIRmMVX8pYt0t6FGU.png","name":"Silver Screen Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":52429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lasky Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":192262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Larry A.
