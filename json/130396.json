Lefebvre take off for the land of the rising sun, Japan. In Nos voisins Dhantsu, they prove once again that no culture is too different to take on. Their travelogue, mostly limited to Tokyo, is at times well-planned and executed in tightly rehearsed situations, sometimes the scenes use local actors and crew, and then at other times the film erupts in the complete craziness of improvisational comedy. Nos voisins Dhantsu captures Béland's view of an ordered, modest and mysterious society, often by challenging the stereotypical order and discipline that we think of when we think of Japan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3OwjAvcDDj6lrRuLe0nz2KLkpP3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nos voisins Dhantsu","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":3}
