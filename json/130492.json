For more than a year, the uno bianca gang - they always use a white Fiat Uno - has plagued the area. Their crimes are violent, sometimes killing carabineri, and there's no particular pattern: a bank one day, a petrol station the next, extortion of a small business the next. Are they terrorists? A foreign gang? Tied to the Mafia? After a particularly bloody shootout, two detectives are assigned to start fresh: they go through the notebooks of previous investigators and they interview a few witnesses again. They find a pattern in the crimes and predict the next assault, but the special task force in Bologna is dismissive. Can they carry on alone; how far will they get?","popularity":2.115,"poster_path":"/dOH8DzZIieH9NOJxF5LXxBe0HaZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uno bianca","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":28}
