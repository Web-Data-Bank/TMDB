Mostly told from the point-of-view of a young, sexually aggressive woman, named Chance, whom according to her: \"we're all out there looking for true love\", which turns out to be a very elusive thing indeed, and Chance is no exception. She's desperately on the prowl for a man, but since she's more mouse than cat, she gets herself into scrape after scrape in her screwball pursuit of love. Surrounded by a bevy of adoring but completely wrong-for-her men (and one dead girl from Manchester, England), Chance has to pick her way through her messy life in order to figure out which guy is \"it\".","popularity":2.546,"poster_path":"/nrSrZ3udX7afhB6OL3vx3vnDF0M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chance","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7}
