There are shades of John Carpenter's They Live, caffeinated Evil Dead speed-freakery, a cameo by Miles O'Keeffe, and uncanny movie preview clichés, such as sentence prepositions that never reach a resolution: \"On an alien planet…the beauty and wisdom of a sorceress….\" Sometimes the liner note blurbs speak for themselves: \"Damon Packard is to Stephen Spielberg what George Kuchar is to Douglas Sirk.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zxFc0U4zAbrsXan8kGALCyDJxXG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn of an Evil Millennium","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
