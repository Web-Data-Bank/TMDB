When he moved to Tangier, Morocco, in 1949, half the world followed him to the enigmatic city. His marriage with author Jane Bowles was a loving relationship of opposites, even though both were homosexual. Based on exclusive interviews with Bowles shortly before his death interwoven with anecdotes recounted by his friends and co-workers, the film portrays a daring and visionary life as well as a relationship shaped by an interdependency that encompassed much more than sexuality.","popularity":0.702,"poster_path":"/c4Jab4YK42pcWa3fsUcuGlRlUQx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116237,"logo_path":null,"name":"HesseGreutert Film AG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Bowles: The Cage Door Is Always Open","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
