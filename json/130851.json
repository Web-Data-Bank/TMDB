Conner and Leary occupied themselves with mushroom hunts in the Mexican countryside. It’s not clear whether their hunts were successful. But Conner’s staccato home-movies of their walks – combined with movies of previous mushroom hunts in San Francisco – became his film Looking for Mushrooms. The film rushes through the rustic landscape of rural Mexico, flitting past houses and through a crumbling graveyard.  Not to be confused with Conner's re-edited 1996 version of Looking for Mushroom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for Mushrooms","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
