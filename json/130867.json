The irritated French Intelligence service closes in on her, which leads to a tit-for-tat game of intrigue between the hacker and her pursuers. Helmed by a female director, this film is of some historical significance, given its unusually frank, straightforward, and accurate portrayal of the day-to-day experiences of north African women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qShsfjh3XcGlJ52zI1er9JCzbTd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"2003-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bedwin Hacker","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6}
