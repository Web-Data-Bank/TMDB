Coupled with Ballard's penchant for polish, Johnny Rzeznik's introspection on \"Without You Here\" hews close to the center line before Robbie Takac's \"Listen\" gives the album a much-needed jolt of energy. The album's featured cover, a faithful, contemporary AOR-friendly take on Supertramp's \"Give a Little Bit,\" is emblematic of the Goo Goo Dolls fortunes here: They often seemed boxed in by a past that's not necessarily their own. --Jerry McCulley","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3345,"logo_path":"/9osXMsxl3h772MSO4CIFycy4MfV.png","name":"Warner Music Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goo Goo Dolls Let Love In - Live And Intimate","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
