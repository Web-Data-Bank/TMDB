This performance sees him take his unique brand of Australiana to the world, performing sell-out concerts as part of the DILLIGAF World Tour. It features a catalogue of self penned bawdy ballads that translate to every English speaking country in the world. In addition to the performance, we see another side of Kev. Also included are bonus film clips from Kev, as well as a special on stage performance from Kevs support act on the tour - Jenny Talia from Australia. After 20 years at the top, Kev has deservedly achieved Legendary status - there is no stopping this True Aussie Icon, who continues to delight fans from all corners of the Globe !","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/25zmsXhwDboio9ttTk4aZ8UX7Dh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kevin Bloody Wilson - Let Loose Live In Ireland","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
