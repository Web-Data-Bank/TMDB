As a result, over 90 percent of the country's traditional musicians were killed. Now, as the handful of surviving musicians grow old and fall ill, a way of life quietly slips toward the brink of extinction. Facing this desperate situation is Arn Chorn Pond - a survivor of Cambodia's genocide, an internationally recognized human rights leader and a talented musician. Today Arn is striving to heal the deep scars of his wartorn past by bringing Cambodia's once outlawed traditional music back to his people. The Flute Player is a heroic story of one man's fight against the devastating effects of war. It is a film about sorrow and pain, dignity and freedom, and the will to survive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gaZXfHV7cdYGx3BZGsHdsk74Z3I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flute Player","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
