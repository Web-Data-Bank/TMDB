The main characters – Saima, Tuulikki and Salla – each lives in the same country house. Saima´s story takes place in the war time 1942, when Finland fought against Soviet Union, Tuulikki´s story in colourful year 1978 and Salla´s story in the present day. Each woman is between 30 and 40. This deep and beautiful, yet humorous film pictures the encounters between people and the possibilities for choice. How much does the time we live in affect us - and our ability to hold on to our dreams? What are those things which we pass on from one generation to the next? What changes, what remains the same? And to what extent do mothers´ choices, let alone their unspoken secrets, affect their daughters´ lives?","popularity":1.422,"poster_path":"/A6T1mDbp2GbJoultj8KBPqBbUOe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12496,"logo_path":"/tk6stgFevcJ2iWyd0IaEfVStNqL.png","name":"Pegasus Pictures","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":132673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pystymetsä","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2012-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stars Above","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8}
