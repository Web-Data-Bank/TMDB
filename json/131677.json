A stranger arrives in the small, rural community and disrupts the lives of its inhabitants. The man, who refuses to give his name, is dubbed The Outlander. A traveller who disdains conventional behaviour and parochialism, The Outlander disturbs the villagers' complacency and scandalizes the community; he also elicits admiration and gains a woman's love. He ultimately leaves in the same manner he had arrived, but not before he has helped the villagers open their eyes to the larger world beyond their village.","popularity":1.042,"poster_path":"/iymwbTBD98K0BIy7DMzkBTomZ7A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13312,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Vision 4","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":806,"logo_path":"/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png","name":"Téléfilm Canada","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":11578,"logo_path":"/us1W5CytIttX4F526bRJmrS36dJ.png","name":"Super Écran","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":808,"logo_path":"/4L1apH72jCx6Z5qyH7UOJUDlRoF.png","name":"The Movie Network","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":9116,"logo_path":"/vYeYdFxDWoqBzFgYz2Tf9d2ZseE.png","name":"SODEC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":102759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seville Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":2743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astral Media","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":803,"logo_path":"/jEMVaCuEjQ3lzkhakWDKNVjwd9Q.png","name":"Alliance Atlantis","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-04-22","revenue":2866324,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nevemind!","title":"The Outlander","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3}
