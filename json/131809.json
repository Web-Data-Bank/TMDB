In 1996, two aged teachers and the children and their families reunite. Lisa Gossels, whose father and uncle were among the children, records it. Survivors' comments, photos and drawings from the war, footage of the school and town, and a celebration of the heroism and leadership of the school's director, Felix Chevrier, comprise the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Chabannes","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":3}
