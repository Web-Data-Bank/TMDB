On another level, the film is also about Jeremy's family, and how they cope with events that have forever changed them. By turns heartbreaking and inspiring, \"Home Front\" gets behind the often-sanitized myth of war to reveal its true complications and costs.","popularity":0.663,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Front","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
