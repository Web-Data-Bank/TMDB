It is a high-performance, location-based surf film set against exotic landscapes, objects and personalities juxtaposed with the traditions of suburban life. Spontaneity versus routine. The unknown versus the familiar. An interpretation of our lifestyle, culture, riding waves, traveling the world â€” a pirouette into the absurdity of it all. The result is a graceful, often schizophrenic glimpse at modern life with a surfboard and a passport.","popularity":1.998,"poster_path":"/8Gy093J6akKlQ9PYKel8enQQuzC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Suburbia,","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":3}
