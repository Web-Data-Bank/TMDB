She is so frightened she wants to leave on the spot; but David can't feel or see any of the things she describes. However, when Sonia gets kidnapped, her boyfriend begins to sense something is going on. He decides to investigate in order to get the young woman back. As he does so, he will meet disturbing characters, unexpected and undreamed-of help, and a truth from beyond.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/moBNwutxVf4GmVOt10ixV9uJtRM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ossessione","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
