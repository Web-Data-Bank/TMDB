The BGM in the film consists entirely of Dvorak's Serenade for Strings, making it perhaps the only anime since Gauche the Cellist to make use of a single piece of classical music as the soundtrack. The plot of the film is simple and the outcome obvious, but the atmosphere of the film is genuine, and it is very moving in parts thanks to Dvorak's music (which is scored entirely for the most emotional of the instrument groups, the strings). This is a straightforward drama about the friendship between a boy and his wolf, and it pushes all the buttons you'd expect, but it's very enjoyable despite all that.","popularity":1.189,"poster_path":"/z0XVFFoSFOARuc8ONW32Zwm3Wha.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5397,"logo_path":"/ufEcABqc3fK5ehfwueZ684svd4N.png","name":"Group TAC","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
