From English icon Morrissey's performance at the inaugural Coachella Festival back in 1999 to Canadian indie rockers the Arcade Fire's electric 2005 set, the musical acts featured here run the gamut from hip-hop to alternative and virtually everything in between. Other artists featured include the Pixies, the Flaming Lips, Kool Keith, Radiohead, Saul Williams, and Squarepusher.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/EsMLGp5zgkE8942zGSpNDnofgu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coachella","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
