A fall means splashing into 80 degree water, drying off and trying again - from the bottom. Some call it climbing in its purest form. Others call it a hell of a way to spend a few weeks. Last season, a small group of climbers traveled to those sea cliffs to learn the intricacies of deep water soloing and to try, unrehearsed, some of the hardest - and most aesthetic - routes in the world. Directed and produced by Mike Call, Perfecto captures the beauty, adrenaline and purity of the Mallorca experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zLbMheBA3TJnlUPttW8OgbqAnBI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perfecto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
