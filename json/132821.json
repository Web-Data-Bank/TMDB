In a time when MTV was in full swing, and hair metal was all the rage, bands like Ratt were all over TV and the videos were as sleazy and cheesey as anything you would see on MTV at the time. As you watch the videos from Ratt, you notice how they evolved over the years and what became more imortant to them in the end as to how they wanted to be percieved. Expensive, flashy clothes, make-up, and of course, being surrounded by scantily clad, cleavage bearing girls. In 1986, this was loads of fun, and videos like \"Lay It Down\" were some of the most watched and popular videos on MTV. Looking back on them now, they were a product of their time, and the overindulgence and silliness of it all seems rather dated. The earlier ones like \"Back For More\", and \"Wanted Man\",  were done at a time when the band had yet to reach million selling status.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":"/itTFLED063siE9oiZtoR3DLYn8o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34836,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12700,"logo_path":"/4Bw5eCs1SdRXDmTI84kfuqk6Gqm.png","name":"Warner Music Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ratt 'N' Roll","title":"Ratt : Videos From The Cellar: The Atlantic Years","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
