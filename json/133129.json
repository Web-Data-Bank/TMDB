Black as the night of complete darkness in which the film opens. Two men are in a fishing boat talking. One feels more than one sees that the seawater around them is warm and smooth, teeming with brightly-colored fish. By night, the rubber plantation also comes across as enticing and full of secrets, until lurid reminders of the bloody massacre flash up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u67M86KI1amPikILmEXY5UOD3OI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jürgen Brüning Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2011-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Terrorists","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":5}
