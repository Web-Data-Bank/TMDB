At the peak of their creative art, Bob Mintzer (saxophone), Russell Ferrante (keyboards), Jimmy Haslip (bass) and Marcus Baylor (drums) played with the unaltered intensity &amp; jubilation of their 1981 debut when, as backing band for guitarist Robben Ford, they created the compelling, unmistakable Yellowjackets sound, combining bebop, funk, R&amp;B and rock influences. In the course of their 25 year career, the challenging team of improvising masters – 14 time Grammy Award nominees &amp; twice winners – has turned into a driving force in contemporary music. We are proud to offer the Yellowjackets' countless fans this jewel of musical sophistication &amp; groove!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yellowjackets: The Paris Concert","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
