From love to crime, from marriage to work, from beauty to the ultimate death. Instead of a traditional film adaptation Tarn has been guided by actress Thandie Newton's reading of the text - and then traveled around the world with his 16mm and HD camera and filmed people, situations and places that resonate with, rather than illustrate, the text's themes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3i2gdYIG7UMMkXcOhrO91ApTArv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prophet","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
