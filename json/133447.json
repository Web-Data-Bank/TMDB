His business partners are taken into custody and the authorities have a few questions for him to answer. Rather than wait around, he decides to take off to Moravia with his wife and two children. In the process, he pretends that everything is normal, rediscovers the value of family life, meets up with a former colleague lost in provincial obscurity, and becomes the object of a manhunt. Libor is not a criminal type, merely someone who signs cheques and is drawn into a business world failing to recognise its own criminality (he doesn’t even flee the country).","popularity":0.71,"poster_path":"/a3sXo2gVVZBBsEJIEd6l5GYSIpG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Tools","origin_country":""},{"id":6222,"logo_path":"/lMSKOpqzE0LTlWkjS562SRU4rkH.png","name":"Avion Film \u0026 Sound","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":32252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produkce Radim Procházka","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":29079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bontonfilm","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2011-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Live the Family!","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
