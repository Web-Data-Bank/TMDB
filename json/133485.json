A man and a woman. Moving images on the screen, which he comments on, spurred on by her questions. All the footage was shot from the window of a flat: views of the street, the metro line running above it, the canal, into the windows of the buildings opposite. The flat belongs to the man’s lover, the man is a guest, spending his nights there but never his days. By the canal, young men from Afghanistan set up makeshift shelters as the man looks on, developing increasing sympathy for them. The seasons change, winter, spring, summer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aZisvdbCvmaJhCEbzSL9aQRvAMv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10767,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Huit Production","origin_country":""},{"id":10768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinaps TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jaurès","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
