The situation escalates when one of the stage drivers is mortally wounded; so the marshal sends for his friends, the Range Busters, to help him catch the criminals. Meanwhile, even the marshal's fiancee, the editor's daughter, turns against him in favor of an aggressive agitator for law and order - who secretly is leading the robber gang.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hYhMbr4BsmQ5ASSHJwppiKBy5qR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Range Busters","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock River Renegades","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
