He’s got three popular podcasts, 400,000 plus Twitter followers, a series on Comedy Central, and a new comedy doc: The Greatest Movie Ever Rolled. It’s a fast paced look at life on the road for a comic with a rabid following, as he travels with his buddy - clean-livin’, wound-up karate enthusiast, Graham Elwood - on a tour to raise money to make a movie about going on tour to raise money to make a movie. Yeah, so very Spurlock of him. Doug finds fun everywhere he goes, and he’d like to share it with you.","popularity":1.755,"poster_path":"/y0RUndPIKTpGEnD3DsGHykOgVwW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Movie Ever Rolled","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":7}
