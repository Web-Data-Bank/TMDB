Shot in an unusually intimate manner, the film communicates powerfully the immediate excitement of jazz as a no-holds-barred, risk-embracing adventure: the shooting and editing highlight the exceptional collective improvisation and musical dialog which characterize Zawinul's work. From a childhood in Vienna, to a move to the United States in 1958, Zawinul found success with the band Weather Report.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8XvhkMS957GZtQJfHbIo3ircjYQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe Zawinul: A Musical Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
