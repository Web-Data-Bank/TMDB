Disease was also unfinished. This show marked the Phish debuts of Undermind and She Thinks I Still Care. Frankenstein featured Page on keytar. Before Contact, the band and audience sang Happy Birthday to Fish’s Dad, Leonard, and the end of Contact featured a Happy Birthday jam. The post-show music included \"Sweet Virginia\" from Exile on Main Street.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phish: 03/08/2009 Hampton Coliseum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
