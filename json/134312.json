Because of this unique trait, he has lived through many historical periods of Malaysia; from the colonial years to the Japanese invasion and Independence. Though some may consider it a gift, the man's long life can also be a curse as he has to face the reality of seeing the ones he loves die. A highlight of the film will be the changing landscape of Malaysia from the early days up to 2012.","popularity":1.631,"poster_path":"/nyxMvfBZoBG1iDCaOgB5VnCLgUV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15205,"logo_path":"/yioKGyNvToqvVIdTOJji2OOXnqH.png","name":"KRU Studios","origin_country":"MY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2012-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Anugerah atau sumpahan?
