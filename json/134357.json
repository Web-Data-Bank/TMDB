The result is a unique cinematic experience-- a shifting mosaic of encounters and raconteurs, captured glances and telling gestures, all beautifully shot and woven together by the music and the found sounds of a city sluggishly coming to life. Rejecting the usual device of narration and portraiture, the film asks the viewer to experience Kabul as a newly arrived visitor would-- with a freshness born of apprehension on finding oneself in a place that is at once hauntingly strange and altogether familiar.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An empire at a crossroads -- A city rising from the rubble","title":"Kabul Transit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
