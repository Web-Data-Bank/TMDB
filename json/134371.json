Brilliant creators, from artists to industrialists, continue to mysteriously disappear. Unemployment has risen to 24%. Gas is now $42 per gallon.  Dagny Taggart, Vice President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, has discovered what may very well be the answer to the mounting energy crisis - found abandoned amongst ruins, a miraculous motor that could seemingly power the World.  But, the motor is dead... there is no one left to decipher its secret... and, someone is watching.  Itâ€™s a race against the clock to find the inventor and stop the destroyer before the motor of the World is stopped for good.  A motor that would power the World. A World whose motor would be stopped.
