Interesting back projections, lasers and generic lights will be an entertaining addition whether you've seen the show live or watch it for the first time via your home cinema. Good old \"hits\" by TD will be alternated and supported by some brand-new stuff composed for the gig. Images from backstage and 'making of' sequences can be seen as a summary of a great \"night at space\" including the safe and comfortable landing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6V6UtIqhQDpfRz2qwpIDHOUcMvF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eastgate Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live at the Alte Oper Frankfurt","title":"Tangerine Dream - One Night in Space - Live at the Alte Oper Frankfurt","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
