Nobody can touch me!”. Since riding into the scene as an extra in John Cena’s entrance at WrestleMania 22 to defending the WWE Title in main events all over the world in recent years, the “Voice of the Voiceless” has backed up that statement.  Now, WWE fans get an unprecedented look inside the life and career of the most controversial Superstar of this generation. The first ever documentary to focus on CM Punk traces his rise to the top of WWE, from this early success on ECW, his divisive perpetuating of the Straight Edge Subculture, to becoming internationally revered as the best wrestler in the world.","popularity":2.919,"poster_path":"/deUiziVFN7VsnaxuCZ5yXxm4TNL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13651,"logo_path":"/rVJkMs9cSaE1BQoPiDcH6OxmaVZ.png","name":"WWE Home Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CM Punk: Best in the World","video":true,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":28}
