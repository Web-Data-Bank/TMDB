This release focuses on the concert from 1993 when she was at her absolute peak and complements it with selected tracks from many other Montreux appearances. It features many of her best loved tracks and songs that she is particularly associated with. Etta James was one of the most respected performers of her generation. In a career stretching over 60 years she was inducted into the Rock’n’Roll Hall Of Fame and the Blues Hall Of Fame, won 3 Grammys and received many more nominations and was named Female Blues Artist Of The Year on no less than 14 occasions. Etta James sadly passed away after a long illness in January 2012 and this DVD is a fitting tribute to one of the greatest female vocalists of the 20th century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/576uT7rSXaF6wy7Uew9aXnyGUbU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Etta James LIve at Montreux 1993","title":"Etta James LIve at Montreux 1993","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
