By summoning the creative voice of poetry to tell stories of survival and witness, each reclaims humanity and dignity in the wake of some of history’s most dehumanizing circumstances. With grace and humor, the film explores language as an internal means of survival—for the poet and the readers of poems.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poetry of Resilience","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
