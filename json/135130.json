Mission? To reignite the moon (his jar of delights is important here) and help defend her from a pair of rascally Gargaloons.","popularity":1.052,"poster_path":"/1V1IoxaDQJEMKjqtSOrw3fOe8OP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11537,"logo_path":"/AgCkAk8EpUG9fTmK6mWcaJA2Zwh.png","name":"Laika Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moongirl","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":10}
