The fact-based film directed by Leszek Dawid charts the relentless struggle for success of Paktofonika, against the backdrop of crumbling traditional values in dreary 90s Silesia. The contradictory ideals of hiphop - the rebellious, edgy lyrics against the ‘system’ juxtaposed with the money and  fame sought by the artists - are superbly captured in this dark, unforgettable drama.","popularity":2.421,"poster_path":"/zhIGg5JwAhWe1ISsnAUID2gpC2w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Kadr","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":72548,"logo_path":"/mByJIaYKm9P2hImj0D2jvWNTlR1.png","name":"Kino Świat","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":11240,"logo_path":"/i59ItaKFdxJ7Yi6w2s7CML0LBvI.png","name":"PISF","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":3555,"logo_path":"/5vgxuOmB1UX3t6tPv6TChQCbyXf.png","name":"Chimney Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":54245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silesia Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2012-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Are God","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":51}
