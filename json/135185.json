She learns of mother Alycia's fatal fall, an official suicide but was probably murder. Dad keeps Andy at a distance, so he draws towards Liz. Real danger starts when Richard's brother, novelist Blain, arrives with his friend Jillian, to sell the ancestral estate against Richard's will.","popularity":1.77,"poster_path":"/vM14KFQldRq3cjlo0CHfstzweAV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harlequin","origin_country":""},{"id":10864,"logo_path":"/uPoKSf3GtME7IZz4alnoWvc0nWx.png","name":"CTV","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":2514,"logo_path":"/zEyrFF8Nn325PXG0Q9j7my0JqIJ.png","name":"Alliance Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Midnight Hour","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":9}
