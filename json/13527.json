To Kriss this film is the bible. One day after a serious conflict with one of the hospital's other patients their viewing rights are retracted. Kriss is deeply frustrated by this, until he realises that Linda, the young girl in the film, actually exists in the shape of the film's star, the actress Ulla Vilstrup. Setting fire to the hospital, Kriss and Willy escape into the night, determined to find her, because life is what you make of it.","popularity":2.502,"poster_path":"/t7zXccdR3a5empuetzv8DRS6p1Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2761,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fine \u0026 Mellow Productions","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2006-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To Kriss, the World is Black and White.
