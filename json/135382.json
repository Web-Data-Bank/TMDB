Once again André Rieu transformed the Vrijthof square in his hometown Maastricht into a grand, romantic open-air concert hall with room for about ten thousand people for his traditional summer evening concerts.  André returns to Maastricht bringing with him two wonderful guest choirs – the Harlem Gospel Choir and the Soweto Gospel Choir – and a very special guest: Oscar-winning actor Sir Anthony Hopkins! The Hollywood-based star is a great admirer of André Rieu and wrote a piece called “And The Waltz Goes On” specially with Rieu in mind. André Rieu performed it in Maastricht for the first time for such a large crowd.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/52SzmLXTlY0u944rXcfwFhAaERe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60911,"logo_path":"/Atub6EGDrBdErV4qz6OakSGhrd.png","name":"André Rieu Studios","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"André Rieu - Under The Stars: Live In Maastricht V","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
