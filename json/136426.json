For the \"supervisors\" of the Bat Yam neighbourhood in Israel, this means ensuring that women are dressed appropriately, that people respect Shabbat, or that Arabs from Jaffa don't enter the neighbourhood with music blaring from their cars. Avi, Kobi and Yaniv are young and know how to fight. They want to force their neighbours to become religious, without hesitating to be violent in the name of God. The inhabitants admire the gang and are afraid of them at the same time. One day a new girl, Miri, arrives. She is not familiar with the strict rules of modesty. The gang's leader Avi is going to be torn between his feelings for Miri and his dedication to the gang.","popularity":0.919,"poster_path":"/dB5Ritb3kEMzI1RMHjBzee5Naav.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transfax Film Productions","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":786,"logo_path":"/cWtcpHzvZoSzVTzXkzyidgWgjyr.png","name":"Bizibi","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":22231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Israel Film Fund","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2012-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God's Neighbors","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":12}
