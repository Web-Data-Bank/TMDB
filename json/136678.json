It follows the plight of Europe's Jews during the terrifying period from 1933 until the final defeat of the Third Reich in 1945. Never before had the world seen such contempt for human life on such a grand scale, the murder of an estimated 6 million Jews, with countless others persecuted. During the 1930s a wave of national fervor swept through a tumultuous Germany; people looked for answers, and the politicians were all too willing to point the finger of blame towards the Jewish population. Few, if any, could have foreseen how the views of one man would unfoldâ€¦that man was Adolf Hitler.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2FJ5lVvquyWTiqn2HEFKVpzpeNg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chronos Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Yellow Star: The Persecution of the Jews in Europe - 1933-1945","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6}
