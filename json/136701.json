Several years later, after taking the Han Emperor under his wing, Cao crowns himself King of Wei. He built a magnificent Bronze Sparrow Island to symbolize his power and rumors spread that he would replace the Emperor. Meanwhile, young lovers Mu Shun (Hiroshi Tamaki) and Ling Ju (Liu Yi-Fei) are taken from a prison camp to a hidden tomb, where they spend five cruel years together, training as assassins for a secret mission. In the year 220 BC astronomical signs predict dramatic change. As a result, Cao's son Cao Pi (Yau Sam-Chi) and Cao's followers urge Cao to become the new Emperor - but unknown opposing forces plot against him.","popularity":7.133,"poster_path":"/iflthXJoh1jDND6CWCrEAG9JgwT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17818,"logo_path":"/a0dRBd4hPab4KjmbiIJpNwRfIVD.png","name":"Beijing Enlight Pictures","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":48805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Changchun Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2012-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Assassins","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":48}
