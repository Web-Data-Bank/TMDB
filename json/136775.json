Before joining the force he ran with a football firm, getting involved in tear-ups up and down the country. Now he's on the other side of the law and faces a tough decision, side with his old crew or protect London as it burns and rioters run amok. Falling in love with fellow cop Louise, he is quickly alerted to a street-level uprising that is about to shake London. Amidst the brutalities presented by the riots, he fights for justice at Louise's expense. Having been raped by a rioter known to him, Damien finds himself levelling with the rioters, fighting a war he cannot win, as much against the rioters as against himself.","popularity":3.01,"poster_path":"/13E6v159XQcKhY7A6wW1nsBxgeN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chata Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":14355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Press On Features","origin_country":""},{"id":14262,"logo_path":"/x04bvG6G7J3EfweMELPmTRnYwSL.png","name":"Templeheart Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"London Burns.
