The movie is set while Kirikou is still a child and Karaba is still a sorceress. Like Princes et princesses and Les Contes de la nuit, it is an anthology film comprising several episodic stories, each of them describing Kirikou's interactions with a different animals. It is however unique among Michel Ocelot's films, not only in that it is co-directed by Bénédicte Galup (who has previously worked with him as an animator) but also for each of the stories being written by a different person (in all other cases, Ocelot has been the sole writer and director of his films).","popularity":7.398,"poster_path":"/ixTVgA2TtUCnYLy9VMhRzkdopUe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Armateurs","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Armada Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kirikou and the Wild Beasts","video":false,"vote_average":6.321,"vote_count":279}
