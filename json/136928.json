Sex, drugs, yoga, and organic cooking absorb their days, safely tucked away from the stresses of urban life. But when a blackout of apocalyptic proportions strands them with no heat and no electricity during the coldest winter on record, their utopian commune is breached by anxiety and their idyllic harmony begins to lose its tune. As time wears on and the food supply dwindles, power struggles, jealousy, and desire threaten the group's ability to work together in order to survive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xPpYvWjuKjPucuB6HhQwhVjygv6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Escape","title":"First Winter","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":6}
