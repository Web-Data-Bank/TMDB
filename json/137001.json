Rummaging, stuttering, and smashing through the leftovers of American culture, these ragged souls conjure an unstable magic, fueled by their own apathy and the poisonous histories imbedded in their unearthed junk. Suspicion, boredom, garbage, and glamor conspire in the languid pageantry of ruin. Feel the breeze in your hair, and the world crumbling through your fingers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circle in the Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
