Singer's widow, Marlon, believes he's still alive and she employs the investigative skills of the tough, no-nonsense private eye, Cliff Hardy (Bryan Brown) to find him. Battered and bruised, Hardy battles through the filth of corruption and the stench of political blackmail. He comes face to face with the crime bosses, who feed off human misery and eliminate their rivals without thinking twice. From the high life and low life of Sydney, to the seediness and splendour of Bondi Beach, Cliff Hardy uncovers the ultimate truth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qqFl6HL6XiGhiOuGUthWLhd5LJi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cliff Hardy - One Man Against Sydney's Underworld","title":"The Empty Beach","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":2}
