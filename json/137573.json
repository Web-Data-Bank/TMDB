The documentary recreates a common type of crash - a serious, but survivable 'forced landing' - in order to study the crashworthiness of the aircraft's airframe and cabin, examine the impact of crashes on the human body, and look for possible means of increasing passenger survivability.  By crashing the plane, the programme also aims to answer key questions - such as whether sitting at the front or the rear of the aircraft, wearing a seat belt, and whether you use the brace position - can make the difference between life and death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Plane Crash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
