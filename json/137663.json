From a group of eager and beautiful young women, five are chosen for a photo shoot on an island off the California coast. One of the five will be the cover girl, and she'll get an extra $100,000. On the island, the group stays at an isolated inn, staffed by the odd Frab. There's him, the five models, and four magazine staff: photographer, make-up man, ambitious assistant Anesa, and Jack Denton, the playboy in charge of production. One by one, models and staff disappear.","popularity":1.217,"poster_path":"/1JBRgbO2S6AmREbtnaezqhzwi8u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35878,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wildcat Productions Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":35879,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rocky Point Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sex, Sun and Murder...","title":"Bikini Island","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":8}
