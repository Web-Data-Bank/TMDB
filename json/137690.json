Living on food from garbage containers and trading the books and porn magazines they find there, they nonetheless live lives of independence, love and humour. Jana, a former prostitute, tries to visit her daughter while Jan visits his aged mother after many years, but both fail to re-establish links with their past. Through identification with their everyday world, Vondráček reaches the human reality and complexity beneath the surface, a world not so different from that of the supposedly successful. Eventually, they are expelled from their temporary home with heartbreaking consequences. Vondráček’s award-winning documentary reveals the breadth of experience – even vibrancy – surviving in the world of the dispossessed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pWxgs6tTlV4ZWvUrA9QI5ytcDG9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118572,"logo_path":null,"name":"YEKOT FILM","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2012-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An account of the life and love of a homeless couple who live in a cemetery and their resilience in the face of social indifference.","title":"Love in the Grave","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
