It is the story of a boy stranded between two cultures. Animated vignettes – some humorous and some poetic – track Jung from the day he first meet his new blond siblings, through elementary school, and into his teenage years, when his emerging sense of identity begins to create fissures at home and ignite the latent biases of his adoptive parents. The filmmaker tells his story using his own animation intercut with snippets of super-8 family footage and archival film. The result is an animated memoir like no other: clear-eyed and unflinching, humorous, and above all, inspiring in the capacity of the human heart.","popularity":2.394,"poster_path":"/lLr90DiyM8mRgBgsRDzgiDwtzxf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8009,"logo_path":"/jMXTbZ35gAiHCjIfdDq1B7On9fv.png","name":"Belgacom","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":11773,"logo_path":"/8fCjsqh43LbPV6pm3SfR5Jx64GU.png","name":"Artémis Productions","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":42210,"logo_path":"/90jvlHsNtaFyft0LVMyw8cDBIQc.png","name":"2 Minutes","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2012-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Approved for Adoption","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":23}
