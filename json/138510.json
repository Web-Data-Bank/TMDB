He soon gets involved in their lives, and even gets attracted to plain-looking Saundarya (Divya Mirza), who he transforms into a beauty, after a cosmetic makeover. Aman's kindness is mistaken for generosity by all the chawl dwellers, and they swarm him for his money, trying to get loans and gifts, to improve their lives.
