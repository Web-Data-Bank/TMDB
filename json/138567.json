They waterski. They dive. They are jealous. They are potential final girls. One of 'em is called Four-Eyes (Louis Kong) and has a little brother.  After hours of painful \"excitement\" with them, a friendly dead guy (Roy Cheung) starts to kill off the annoying people. Instead of thanking the dead guy or making him president of the yacht club or something, a security guard calls his uncle, a buddhist exorcist.  Too bad for him that he's a crap exorcist, and doesn't survive the meeting with dead guy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":90175,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xeaco Holding","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1986-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escape from Coral Cove","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
