The son of a white army officer and his wife who were slain by Indians, Zagor was raised by a trapper who taught him to be murderously handy with an ax, a task that would come in handy when he embarked on his planned mission of vengeance against his parents' killers. Upon reaching adulthood, however, Zagor discovered that his father had also been responsible for the deaths of many Indians, and that the moral line was not drawn as clearly as he had initially thought. As a result, he vowed to become an equal opportunity protector of the oppressed, whether they be white settlers or Indians.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/13nXyNAfyFsdJtbbm88pWCrzBZn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yerli Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1971-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zagor vs. The Dark Menace","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
