But it's not just the constant psychological pressure that gets to them, the different cultures and ways of life in the country also pose problems for the young and impetuous men. However, it is precisely the interpersonal aspect that moves them, and so they become friends with Malik Jamil (Omar El-Saeidi) and his children.
