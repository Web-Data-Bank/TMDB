Amber's mother was model-actress Mandy Mason, who died mysteriously after her appearance in \"Smoke Rings.\" The property rental to Boyce was arranged by middle-aged lawyer Henry Harris, who continues to live with his lovesick memories of the late actress. Boyce invites Harris to dinner, and \"Smoke Rings\" airs on TV that same evening. During the following days, Harris observes Amber's behaviour paralleling events experienced both by her mother and in the movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eRO8kKeDdZZWyIuydpk6dctcyxY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midnight Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
