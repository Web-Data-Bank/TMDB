He makes the trip to remote Pulupandan, her hometown, and is quickly rebuffed by Sonia’s mother Fely. But Makoy has never been one to give up. With the help of Sonia’s father Nestor and his ever-dependable helper Bart, Makoy stays in town to surprise Sonia on her birthday. But alas, Makoy gets into trouble with a group of townsfolk who transform into tiktik—horrific, man-eating creatures with a taste for fetuses that are still in the womb! They are angry, and they are hungry for revenge. Will their thirst for blood and retribution be quenched? Will Makoy finally get his act together, protect Sonia and their baby, and once and for all prove himself worthy of their love? Who will win in the battle between men and monsters?","popularity":1.994,"poster_path":"/djY9jjVQVF1W84ddaIRWsz5Oefx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Post Manila","origin_country":""},{"id":8237,"logo_path":"/8GxGenlMmEDS1Z6vmZA5PDqA3p6.png","name":"GMA Pictures","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":58596,"logo_path":"/kclHw3nOM1uD4W3eqUe76qHp3w2.png","name":"Reality Entertainment","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":59251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agosto Dos Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":59252,"logo_path":"/sK2qY3nfFGGo7zG8WL5VaRYZjJ4.png","name":"Mothership","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-10-16","revenue":2035311,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Filipino Horror Movie with Heart, Guts, Liver, and All Human Flesh Eaten!!!","title":"Tiktik: The Aswang Chronicles","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
