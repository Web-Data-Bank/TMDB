Instead of the elaborately-decorated Christmas trees and presents of today, Lidia shows her grandchildren how she and her family would bring in a fragrant juniper bush and decorate it with edible ornaments (along with the recipes for those edible ornaments). It is a beautiful message of family traditions, not being wasteful, and appreciating nature.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11119,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tavola Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nonna Tell Me a Story: Lidia's Christmas Kitchen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
