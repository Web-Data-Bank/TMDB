Excluded from the school's social mainstream, she meets and befriends new girl and fellow social outcast Nico.  Part Mary Quant and part Edie Sedgewick, Nico is obsessed with mid '60s Mod culture and manages to be a style icon despite having Milroy's disease and walking with a cane.  The blossoming friendship between the girls introduces Sadie to entirely new experiences, pushing the young photographer far beyond her familiar suburban world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are the Mods","video":false,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1}
