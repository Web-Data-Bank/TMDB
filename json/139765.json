A passerby hears a maid's music, fancies he's found his true love, and chats her up. Her boyfriend arrives for his music lesson and jealously dismisses the interloper, who swipes a grinder's organ (and monkey) to help him serenade the maid. Later he follows the boyfriend to a residence hotel and plants a bomb in the man's piano. The organ-grinder is gunning for the thief, and soon the piano, bomb, monkey, thief, and pistol-packing grinder are rolling down the road to the delight of maid and lover. It's ka-boom for some and a kiss for others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/znsFHabB4ut3aCC3hNxSHEAkbYQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do-Re-Mi-Boom!","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
