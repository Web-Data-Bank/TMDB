Now the concert is finally available on DVD.  Twelve songs including classics like Oh, happy day and songs from her album like Save the children but also Främling, Mitt i ett äventyr and Fångad av en stormvind are included in a medley. Obviously all three get a nice gospel frosting. Here's Anybody here. There's no doubt gospel where this girl puts her heart to and belts the songs out like there's no tomorrow.","popularity":0.954,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rival Management","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1994-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carola: Gospel Concert","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
