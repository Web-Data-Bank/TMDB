As a child, Anita had a tonsillectomy, during which her uvula was accidentally removed. The surgery prevents her from singing vibrato and holding long notes, but lends to her much-revered percussive style. Anita overcomes her vocal hurdle, as well as many others -- including poverty, heroin addiction and jail time for a drug arrest -- to become one of the most prolific and respected jazz vocalists of the 20th century.\r Initial release: 30 April 2007","popularity":0.696,"poster_path":"/uIWBnLlhnnrm6VK3nJwToW9ydOm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"She survived it all to become one of the world's great jazz singers","title":"Anita O'Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
