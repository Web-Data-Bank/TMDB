Filmed in black & white DV with vintage costume, props etc. Computer filtered to look old and emulate framerate. This is probably my favorite movie project, since I had a relatively easy time filming it and was quite pleased with the results. The fact we did the entire thing in 9 months didn’t hurt either!  - Benjamin J.
