Allowing amputees to walk again thanks to a bionic prosthesis or having a job interview with a robot is no longer science fiction. Technology is everywhere. It governs our social interactions and even intrudes into our bodies. But how far are we willing to let our machines go? It is this recurring issue, at the origin of many utopian works, that is addressed in this movie by Philippe Borrel.","popularity":0.72,"poster_path":"/d9a0zZDczeHMBTPpiFxV3OHx2c2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11331,"logo_path":"/wcHhcw58wms26ejFLx1unYDT37n.png","name":"Cinétévé","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How far are we willing to let our machines go?","title":"A World Beyond Humans?","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":3}
