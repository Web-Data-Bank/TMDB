Jim departs just ahead of the Sherrif with drunken Shanks, and his companion Sally (Gates). Shanks takes off into a small Mexican village after a fight with Jim, stranding both Sally and him with no money. Two local men hear of Jim's plight, and offer him money to smuggle a batch of illegal aliens, called Wetbacks, into the U.S. He agrees but is blackmailed into continuing to run the smuggling operation. Afraid, Jim decides to make a run for it, but someone close to him reveals themselves as a US Immigration agent and asks him to assist them in shutting down the smugglers for good.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2xZSuqN0LjYSHgxPQFj34Yd2LdX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banner Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"BORDER TRAFFIC IN HUMAN LIVES!","title":"Wetbacks","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
