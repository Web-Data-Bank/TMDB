Over the course of a single day and night, M's solipsistic existence is shaken when his nephew kills a man in Nazareth, placing the entire family at risk of reprisals. This masterful feature - a quietly witty, complex and occasionally surreal depiction of an exile's relationship with Palestine - marks a new direction in Khleifi's work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mnzYKLYVo85YzVFuzI4AYEsLPDS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2009-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zindeeq","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
