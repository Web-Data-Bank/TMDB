It's been three years since gunfighter Blaine Madden (Calhoun) visited his hometown. So when he warns the Sully brothers to stop harassing the town drunk, they shoot the old man dead, not realizing he's Madden's father. Killing them both, Madden is badly wounded by the sheriff (Cameron) but escapes to an outlaw haven where the law fears to tread and prepares what may be his last stand. Written by Jo Heims (Play Misty for Me), The Gun Hawk was the final film directed by Edward Ludwig, whose nearly 50-year career spanned over 100 shorts, TV episodes and features, including the John Wayne hits The Fighting Seabees, Wake of the Red Witch and Big Jim McLain.","popularity":2.571,"poster_path":"/dKef1SDZbvL85HQcG1ZaoqCI9Fq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allied Artists Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":13090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bern-Field Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He Was As FEARED as JACK SLADE and WYATT EARP!","title":"The Gun Hawk","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":7}
