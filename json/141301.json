They visit a thatched cottage that serves as a memorial shrine (amidado) for the village dead and chat with the attendant, the spry 96-year-old Oume (Tanie Kitabayashi). Together they admire the view -- from an inspiring distance. Oume, it turns out, is a kind of sage, whose thoughts and observations are a popular feature in a column in a local newsletter. Her amanuensis is a mute, sweetly smiling young woman named Sayuri (Manami Konishi), who is as devoted to Oume as Oume is to the souls of her beloved dead.","popularity":2.3,"poster_path":"/six2VmVjQaJclJVaqVDnIxLZami.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asmik Ace Entertainment","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2002-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter from the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":8.375,"vote_count":8}
