Cheung Chi-ho is plotting to kidnap several adult sons of Chinese millionaires. Because of their vicious threats, most of these cases go unreported to the cops, and all goes well, until Cheung teams up with another big-time criminal, Cyclone. On their first job, the rich victim calls the police, and Cheung Chi-ho must strategize his next move against the police.","popularity":1.885,"poster_path":"/3jwUmfFd2EzFNDFVEqjlVYXVh8p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1998-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Billionaires","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
