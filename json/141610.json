It was Gabriel's fifth solo album and the first one to have a title (the others all having just been called \"Peter Gabriel\" ). The album spawned a number of hit singles on both sides of the Atlantic including \"Sledgehammer\", \"Big Time\", \"Don't Give Up\" (a duet with Kate Bush) and \"In Your Eyes\" which drove \"So\" to multi-platinum sales, the No.1 spot in the UK and No.2 in the US. So was very much an album of the MTV generation and the distinctive videos for tracks like \"Sledgehammer\", \"Red Rain\", \"Big Time\" and \"Don't Give Up\" were key factors in the album's success.","popularity":1.586,"poster_path":"/kwNfpafUfejYToAtp0S3hp8kZ8R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isis Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic Albums: Peter Gabriel - So","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7}
