Three girls from Lourdes, France, gather firewood in front of a grotto. Suddenly one of them, Bernadette Soubirous, 14, drops to her knees, gazes ecstatically at something beautiful only she can see, and starts to pray. Soon the town buzzes: Has Bernadette, poor, sickly, and always behind in school, really seen a Lady from Heaven? Then a spring bubbles up from nowhere and withered arms and sightless eyes are cured.  At last, the Lady tells Bernadette her name: “I am The Immaculate Concepcion.”  BERNADETTE, THE PRINCESS OF LOURDES, is the exciting true story of a visit by the Queen of Heaven that left the entire world a source of health for body and soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rtFuv2Mpp1xaaInYzLDySeAxAP0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87990,"logo_path":null,"name":"CCC of America","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bernadette: The Princess of Lourdes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
