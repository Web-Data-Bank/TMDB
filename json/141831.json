Mr. Van Loock is a rabid supporter of the extreme right-wing political party Flemish bloc. Mr. Fawzi, a Moroccan immigrant, is a conservative Muslim. In October 2000, one week prior to a hotly contested national election, 17-year-old Leilah Fawzi falls for 19-year-old Berwout Van Loock. This development sparks a sometimes hilarious and sometimes politically incorrect love story that explores the thin walls between love and hate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The thin walls between love and hate","title":"Kassablanka","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":8}
