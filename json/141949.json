Schrader, after being fired from the production and his version of the film shelved, is brought back 2 years later to complete it on a shoestring budget. In true cinéma vérité style we watch as Schrader and editor Tim Silano work all the angles to get the film on its feet and over to Europe for the world premiere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schrader's Exorcism","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
