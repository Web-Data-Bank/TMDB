Now a young film student in Turin, he watches his neighbors in the flats across from his third floor apartment, especially Sasha when she's naked or arguing with her mother. Giulio's girlfriend is disgusted with his voyeurism, but, after a murder occurs, Giulio is convinced that two relative strangers, just as in Hitchcock and Highsmith's \"Strangers in a Train,\" have agreed to murder each other's bête noir. He follows his suspects, ends up with an intruder and a broken foot, and may be in real danger. Is he more than a peeping Tom?","popularity":2.853,"poster_path":"/xs1dkhYaB3Xz5Ei3x1yQX5zDfSA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26261,"logo_path":"/thn5VXJ5JegdrtiJn7mFuV2NWB6.png","name":"Film Commission Torino Piemonte","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":82322,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opera Film (II)","origin_country":""},{"id":86507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Genesis Motion Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":9207,"logo_path":null,"name":"RaiTrade","origin_country":""},{"id":21525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institut del Cinema Català (ICC)","origin_country":""},{"id":5085,"logo_path":"/mPuVc7m1Ki7OQQvAYwYfIlEI3vu.png","name":"TV3","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2005-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do You Like Hitchcock?","video":false,"vote_average":5.059,"vote_count":51}
