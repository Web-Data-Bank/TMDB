This legendary production starring Cesare Siepi in the title role with Wilhelm Furtwängler conducting was  filmed in Salzburg’s open-air Felsenreitschule theatre during the 1954 Salzburg Festival. Although the production is clearly dated, it remains a must-see for lovers of the opera, both as a historical document of a vintage, all-star production and simply as an excellent way to experience Mozart’s masterpiece.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xT9qYfhrtHaF9qpjnn5UEeenwjo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1955-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Giovanni","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
