Minh-ha's enigmatic documentary is a layered composition of artistic and political reflections on contemporary China. No stone is left unturned as Trinh interprets Chinese musical and operatic traditions, rural life, art, philosophy, calligraphy, storytelling, Confucius, Mao, Tiananmen Square, and the voices of women. Formally and intellectually daring, the film also incorporates techniques from abstract filmmaking to question the creative process of the filmmaker and the viewer.","popularity":0.715,"poster_path":"/uiimAf1nkbi2peF3KTkSwqFvj3l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shoot for the Contents","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
