As soon as the beast is uncovered, however, an alien spacecraft suddenly appears above them and brings the monster back to life! The creature immediately sets about levelling the surrounding urban landscape and shrugging off the best firepower the military can throw at it. A lone scientist, working on decrypting an ancient set of hieroglyphics, may be on the verge of finding the aliens' weak point, but will it be too late?","popularity":3.347,"poster_path":"/2cvqGP48RZX10gyrNcSoJzRZk1m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zero Nine Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":6366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Younggu-Art Movies","origin_country":""},{"id":11554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Korea Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1999-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Think Bigger","title":"Yonggary","video":false,"vote_average":2.694,"vote_count":18}
