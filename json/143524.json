Susannah is dating and their children sense that their Dad may be lonely. So, unbeknownst to him, the children send a personal ad on their Dad's behalf to \"Alaska Love\" magazine, and he lands on the cover as \"Bachelor of the Month.\" As hundreds of letters and eager women begin pouring into town to vie for Jesse's affections, Susannah begins to rediscover her feelings for Jesse.","popularity":3.25,"poster_path":"/cLXrGrVuF0XUwYgPQJUaYGS3BP4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97929,"logo_path":"/oQRFmBTxaCDRhqcHXHTMYWlw3Yl.png","name":"Multicom Entertainment Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":59050,"logo_path":"/qUICKfuADjaDYJWlPRRIcVrJHq3.png","name":"Bunim-Murray Productions (BMP)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":66256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grossbart Barnett Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes love is better the second time around.","title":"Personally Yours","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
