He suggests that they can be regarded as visual music, public dreaming, mythology, and song-lines. In extrapolating the idea of movies as song-lines he examines feature films under the following categories: songs of the land; the bushman; the convicts; the bush-rangers; mates and larrikins; the digger; pommy bashing; the sheilas; gays; the wogs; blackfellas; and urban subversion. He then concludes that these films can be thought of as \"Hymns that sing of Australia.\"","popularity":1.092,"poster_path":"/9OtwIbC4GVbGdKZfuJjMWS47EXx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kennedy Miller Productions","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1997-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The British Film Institute Presents The Century of Cinema: Australia and New Zealand","title":"40,000 Years of Dreaming","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
