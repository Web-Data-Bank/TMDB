These three men, who have nothing in common, all shared one thing: their love for Charlie. One loved her like a sister, one loved her like the woman of his dreams, one loved her like a friend. Except that Charlie is dead and none of them - not Boris, an accomplished businessman, not Elie, a night owl scriptwriter, and not Maxime, still living at home with his mother - know how to deal with it. But because she asked them to do so, they abruptly decide to undertake a journey together, heading for Corsica and the house that Charlie loved so much. Except that here they are stuck in a car together for over 500 miles. It's going to be a long journey. Boris, Elie and Maxime, three men, three generations, no affinity. But by the time they arrive at their destination, they will have realized one majorly important thing: Charlie has changed their lives forever.","popularity":4.491,"poster_path":"/faimmushRwen8519t2vBBAWjrUr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cofinova 7","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zazi Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":51939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stone Angels","origin_country":""},{"id":17223,"logo_path":"/dMH93k5WVtijdYAFLn4JZY1i3md.png","name":"Direct Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Like Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":6.578,"vote_count":243}
