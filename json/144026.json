Arthur is showing aptitude in drawing, and although his parents want to support his skill, Thomas in particular wants him to take up a vocation that is a little more stable.  Willa, the part time librarian, is attracted to Russell, the medical student she meets at the library. And 11-year old Booky is happy that she has been asked to tutor the new older sixth grade student, Georgie Dunlop, in spelling, since she has a crush on him, her first ever. She just can't wait for him to ask her to the school dance. But she begins to have mixed feelings about Georgie based on a gift he gives to her. Digging a little deeper, Booky begins to understand both the good and bad of Georgie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wUteBnyapBQJ7BT4tqOZ09f623K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6252,"logo_path":"/9b3MKk54TG6p059z0t9j4bqgnom.png","name":"Shaftesbury Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":2527,"logo_path":"/osO7TGmlRMistSQ5JZusPhbKUHk.png","name":"Marc Platt Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Booky's Crush","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
