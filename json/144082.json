Drifting from place to place, Hughes finds himself in his hometown of Salt Lake City at Christmas time. Here he hopes to close old wounds and be reunited with his unforgiving son played by Gerald McRaney, and get to know the grandchildren he has never met. McRaney, still resenting the fact that Hughes ran out on his family 25 years earlier, gives his father only one day with his grandkids; after that, he's expected to leave and never come back. All the while Hughes' friends warn him that his son and the past are memories that are best left alone, and should leave, but he has to find out for himself.","popularity":1.037,"poster_path":"/fKlqPdMdsU0AbqB6Svc0snllxZ7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157490,"logo_path":"/37FfAKK1rGaxwcCDUCNZ3kMfpPp.png","name":"Joe Byrne/Falrose Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":24360,"logo_path":"/5rGQWXRUcKSIrGhDu2vvAw8kcwJ.png","name":"Phoenix Entertainment Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The best thing about Christmas is Family...","title":"A Hobo's Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
