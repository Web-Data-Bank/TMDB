The Desert Tigers) tries to whip a group of recalcitrant American troops into shape in order to lead them on a dangerous commando raid deep in enemy territory. He's assisted in his efforts by Lt. Billings ('Jeff Cameron', aka Giovanni Scarciofolo), a comparatively sane US Army officer. Coming very late in the Italian war movie cycle, I Giardini del Diavolo (Heroes Without Glory) is bottom of the barrel cinema scrapings, with little effort made to maintain period detail or military accuracy. Thankfully, there's a fair amount of action provided as a distraction from the threadbare plot and early '70s hairstyles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/clBDTB9nS2z10p7Ls2LE3FTANLy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marina Cine Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1971-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gardens of the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
