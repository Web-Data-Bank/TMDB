This kingdom of faith is now your home country. You’re no longer strangers or outsiders. You belong here, with as much right to the name Christian as anyone. God is building a home. He’s using us all – irrespective of how we got here – in what he is building. He used the apostles and prophets for the foundation. Now he’s using you, fitting you in brick by brick, stone by stone, with Christ Jesus as the cornerstone that holds all the parts together.”Ephesians 2:19-22 (MSG)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1YA0mj3GwQgOYoQQiL0UWPJ0uai.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hillsong","title":"Hillsong - Cornerstone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
