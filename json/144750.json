The intensity of the performances in this video suggest an artist who burned at full throttle every time he played. Guitarists as diverse as Eric Clapton and Jerry Garcia have cited King as a formative influence. Most of the clips in this collection come from a unique time warp, a fleeting moment when Southern R&amp;B collided with mid-60s 'Mod' and rendered a show called The!!!!Beat. Freddie King was 31 at the time of The!!!!Beat, playing and singing in prime form. This video collection presents all of Freddie King's appearances. The DVD concludes with three tunes performed in Sweden in 1973 and shows Freddie's artistic growth.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/tMovEpy8MzeQk701J0gvhBHvV0y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freddie King: The Beat 1966","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
