This Carmen perfectly hits the gypsy theme as a way of life rather than just some sleazy seductress. This Carmen is troubled, intense, manipulative and totally believable as \"damaged\".  Alagna plays his part brilliantly. He is seduced and naive. He is angry and frustrated. He has that \"I can fix her\" syndrome. Poplavskaya is always a pleasure in my book---and this role, while a small part, suits her. She is very naive and lost in the shuffle of the military and the gypsies...perfect.  Some of this is even a little disturbing as the gypsies put a little lipstick on a very young girl. Brilliant.  In all, this is a fantastic production.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oANDA4PPl51dVUGk6rK50cQdgkv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unitel Classics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
