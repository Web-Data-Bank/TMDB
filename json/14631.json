Divided by their diverse reactions to a nascent ideology, the Steeds struggle to hold together as the strength of their convictions and their filial bonds are tested. The stirring narrative of the faith that led a persecuted people to Missouri and beyond is one of the most poignant untold tales of American history. It is the account of a valiant struggle to exercise the rights promised by a fledgling nation. \"The Work and the Glory: American Zion\" unearths the story of the passion behind the movement which eventually launched the largest American migration and the colonization of the West: the vision of a promised land in America.","popularity":3.333,"poster_path":"/uXGtTR0VhmP1CcJRbBMn07gHc7d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-10-21","revenue":2025032,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every Dream Has a Price","title":"The Work and the Glory II: American Zion","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":10}
