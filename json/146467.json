These three virtuoso musicians have collaborated at various times in their career, but this concert from 1989 comes from the only tour they have done together as a trio. They perform a mixture of tracks from each of their solo repertoire plus special arrangements of some of their favorite tracks by other artists. For jazz musicians, playing at Montreux is always a highlight and the three guitarists are clearly inspired by playing together in the unique Montreux atmosphere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rhw5fblBLSmLy6LAtKHxF3jUU9J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Guitar Trio - Live At Montreux","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
