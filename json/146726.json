In Last Address, filmmaker Ira Sachs, who first moved to the city himself in 1984, uses images of the exteriors of the houses, apartment buildings, and lofts where these and others were living at the time of their deaths to mark the disappearance of a generation. The elegaic film is both a remembrance of that loss, as well as an evocation of the continued presence of their work in our lives and culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fmAVffnKH61jltfakqrWgLztDy3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An elegy for a generation of New York City artists who died of AIDS","title":"Last Address","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
