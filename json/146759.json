An unofficial sequel to 'Born Free' (1966) and 'Living Free' (1972), which also dramatized the life of Adamson, this film picks up the life of George on the African wildlife preserve he runs with the help of his brother Terrence. When drifter Tony Fitzjohn arrives to work for the old men he initially takes poorly to the task, almost savaged by a lion on his first day and on the verge of leaving when he hears that his predecessor was killed in a similar incident. The arrival of a lion cub that Fitzjohn must care for and raise changes everything. Soon he finds himself helping the brothers in their fight to save lions - and, ultimately, the park itself - from the poachers, soldiers and corrupt government officials that threaten them.","popularity":1.628,"poster_path":"/uBudaTpcnMlnax9YhM4Dhno6Yia.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Eight Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":26793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kingsborough Greenlight Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Walk with Lions","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":13}
