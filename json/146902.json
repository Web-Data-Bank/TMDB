This pro shot DVD from a night at Jones Beach captures Page and the band delivering  a number of high-class Led Zeppelin classics, among them 'Celebration Day', 'The Lemon Song', 'Heartbreaker', and 'Whole Lotta Love', as well as numbers that nobody would have expected. Tracks like 'Ten Years Gone', 'Your Time Is Gonna Come' or 'What Is And What Should Never Be' were convincingly delivered thanks to Page and the two Crowes guitarists Rich Robinson and Audley Freed, who not only have the necessary technique but also the right feeling for this kind of material. Chris Robinson delivers an unbelievably powerful and dramatic vocal performance.","popularity":2.38,"poster_path":"/8SkDQsY4Zz4C39mvudt5DGh1ScI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37026,"logo_path":null,"name":"Third Eye Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jimmy Page & The Black Crowes - Live at Jones Beach","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
