But the Russian world champ beats Tommy Rosemund's masterwork in a televised match. So the West German mathematician becomes a top chess pro himself, which the West German media boast will prove the superiority of Germany and democracy. The jowly, white-faced Rosemund believes that the entire Red Communist bloc is out to stop him from vanquishing their atheist pretty boy, Stefan Koruga, to become the next Bobby Fischer and a symbol that capitalism is preferable to socialism.","popularity":1.42,"poster_path":"/9Ey0qDNK45yB1sMeMVZ5iIfw0x3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monaco Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black and White Like Day and Night","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7}
