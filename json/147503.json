He spends a night in Olivier's bed (where Olivier describes a recent visit to a prostitute and how he did not find the experience very enjoyable). After Bernard steals the suitcase belonging to Edouard, Olivier's uncle, and the ensuing complications, he is made Edouard's secretary. Olivier is jealous and ends up in the hands of the cynical and downright diabolical Comte de Passavant, who travels with him to the Mediterranean.","popularity":2.453,"poster_path":"/r3J71vYxHShZTqogwfgk4xUHeQ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Counterfeiters","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":26}
