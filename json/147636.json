In turn, the IRA has sent two members after Riley because he shot an IRA soldier and must pay the consequences. The two IRA operatives looking for Riley come across a really nasty biker who wants vengeance on Eve for setting his car on fire -- and the three men finally track her and Chrissie to the wine-growing country of Barossa Valley. The final denouement is about to explode, as Riley also arrives on the scene. With under-par acting and a patchy plot, this film was never released theatrically.","popularity":0.746,"poster_path":"/2q6XejCAuNUoIDF8gjIWOjxM49R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2806,"logo_path":"/vxOhCbpsRBh10m6LZ3HyImTYpPY.png","name":"South Australian Film Corporation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nobody hurts my car!","title":"Run Chrissie Run!","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
