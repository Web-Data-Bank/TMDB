Making TV programs then became within everyone's reach. Jean-Lou, Yasmina, Victor, Clara, Adonis, and the others didn't only want to create their own television channel, they above all wanted to make a revolution.

And that was my idyllic interlude.","popularity":2.909,"poster_path":"/gGRJjg8YlccKb2aMGe3Bu28UflF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3578,"logo_path":null,"name":"UGC Distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pirate TV","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":47}
