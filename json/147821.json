This is a film record of his most controversial creation: the crucifixion of a young woman, the disembowelling of a lamb carcass, and her defilement with it.  —Peter Gorsen, Sexualaesthetik, 1972","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1969-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria-Conception-Action: Hermann Nitsch","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":11}
