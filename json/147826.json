For a map of the violence inflicted on migrants, the repetition of the colonial movement, and the unacceptability of the “world as it is”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Outbursts (My Mouth, My Revolt, My Name)","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
