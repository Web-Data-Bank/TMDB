Before an appreciative audience in Lyon (France), Marcus and his band settle into a comfortable groove of funk & rhythm and interact with each other very effectively. Christian Scott's trumpet recalls much of the timbre and subtlety of Miles, but with his own unique \"whispering\" style of playing. Quite a virtuoso and extraordinary talent in his own rite.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/z3FAG8dJbJlc0tGzdZWx2V3iirV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victor Musical Industries, Inc.","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":14416,"logo_path":"/iXukz77teH6pv65cieqG9BkZcMr.png","name":"Zycopolis Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marcus Miller - Tutu Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
