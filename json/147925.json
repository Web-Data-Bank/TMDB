Foolishly unprepared to deal with Mother Nature and their situation, they wander around lost for days and weeks, becoming more and more fatigued, hungry, and desperate. A brief encounter with a pair of epicureans on a bridge fails to garner them any of the gluttons' feast due to a language barrier. Eventually their party begins to die, and the survivors ration their meat among them, attaching a religious-type ritual to its dispensation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vvs5n7XKXgQz5hm3Fxxpa9NuFtM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23722,"logo_path":null,"name":"V.O.
