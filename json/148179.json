Lisa Gerrard -  Rheingold - Live At The Loreley","overview":"Klaus Schulze and Australian singer Lisa Gerrard (formerly of Dead Can Dance) work well together on Rheingold: Live at the Loreley. Gerrard doesn't appear on all of this release's moody, hypnotic material, but when she is featured, her performances add a lot to this two-DVD set -- which is a live album more than anything. All of DVD one is devoted to a July 18, 2008 concert in St. Goarshausen, Germany, while DVD two contains the 65-minute documentary \"The Real World of Klaus Schulze\" and a 55-minute interview (the interviewer is singer/guitarist Steven Wilson, a member of the British progressive rock band Porcupine Tree). The concert in St. Goarshausen is Rheingold's main attraction -- and Schulze is in very good form on the songs that feature Gerrard (the 14-minute \"Wellgunde\" and the 39-minute \"Loreley\") as well as the instrumentals that don't (\"Nothung,\" \"Wotan,\" and the 24-minute opener \"Alberich\").","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fxzC0Bzu17z2lyCFqkEkiBY42GS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Synthetic Symphony","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klaus Schulze feat.
