At the start of the film Lars Erik and his wife Sonja are doing well on the Baltic island of Bornholm. Lars Erik is a successful fisherman, Sonja is a traditional housewife, proud of their new house bulging with consumer goods. Their love for each other is the sturdy footing on which their home is founded. Lars Erik employs three men on his trawler, and spends as fast as he earns, so when fishing quotas are cut he faces a crisis. One by one his men leave the boat, but he refuses to give up. Being a fisherman is like being a farmer - you depend on the wealth of mother nature herself. However, mother nature is like romance, highly capricious!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6HtHuutBQvOQLpiu2r4CAifvB1S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Per Holst Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Real people.
