To examine why it works optimally in snakes, they also bread a super-anaconda strain. But the original pair escapes, leaving a bloody trail of human corpses. Murdoch runs, instructing his staff to clean up. They keep failing and being eaten like unsuspecting locals, some alive, even after enlisting ruthless big game hunter Hammett. The fast-growing pregnant monster sheds its skin, thus disabling the only tracking device they have.","popularity":17.298,"poster_path":"/ce2z5H6gS6mc54kpnFj9G0xjH4G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1370,"logo_path":"/uch218gB4XWNz3JNhlc65A5Q207.png","name":"Castel Film","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":3546,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hollywood Media Bridge","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6677,"logo_path":"/iYfrkobwDhTOFJ4AXYPSLIEeaAT.png","name":"Syfy","origin_country":"US"},{"id":199839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Castel Film (US)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2008-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They Can Taste Your Fear","title":"Anaconda 3: Offspring","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":266}
