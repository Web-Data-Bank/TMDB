We shall meet Lev Tolstoy in the final years of his life at Yasnaya Polyana. We shall see him surrounded by his family, friends, acquaintances and absolute strangers who were coming to the great man and artist from all over the world. We shall hear “the voice of his thoughts”. In his sleepless nights, we shall follow his memory of the happy youthful years and the crucial, hard ones. We shall witness Tolstoy’s tragic departure from Yasnaya Polyana and his death at an obscure little station of Astapovo.","popularity":0.707,"poster_path":"/lwX3eqPpvpAurylPsvhPmsZRMJv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32054,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sovinfilm","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":21978,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":12514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slovenská filmová tvorba Koliba (SFT)","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1984-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lev Tolstoy","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
