Although not credited on the album cover or label, Brown's vocal group, The Famous Flames (Bobby Byrd, Bobby Bennett, and Lloyd Stallworth), played an important co-starring role in Live at the Apollo, and are included with Brown by MC Fats Gonder in the album's intro. (It wasn't until the CD release of this album, decades later, that The Flames were finally credited for their work on this album). Brown's record label, King Records, originally opposed releasing the album, believing that a live album featuring no new songs would not be profitable. The label finally relented under pressure from Brown and his manager Bud Hobgood.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":"/7yUJp7jgsp5QbM6nxCsDFWJGUbI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sony Music Entertainment Visual Works Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Brown Live At The Apollo '68","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
