Not only has she dated everyone there; unbeknownst to her, Ben has invited her lame ex-boyfriend in hopes of reuniting them. As she spends the night avoiding her ex, and the other undesirable guys in attendance, she interacts with a colorful assortment of party peeps. Between disappearing fortune tellers and over crowded jacuzzis, she questions if real love is even possible. The irony; the only person she's the least bit attracted to, is the homeless man!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z7oIsxIWwY03MsmeGD2qF0LZprq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Halloween Party","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
