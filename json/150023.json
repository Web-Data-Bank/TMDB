Eleven years later, Elle returns to Earth in order to marry Ataru — by which time not only had he forgotten the events of his childhood, but he was also going out with Lum. The rest of the plot focuses on Lum's attempts to prevent the marriage.  The film was directed by Mamoru Oshii who was mad at the many requests that the producer made of him to alter the movie. Rumiko Takahashi considers this film her favorite and it is the most true to the original series.","popularity":8.403,"poster_path":"/ljvg1lHdN52yNgTTOw6rNwzr9rx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kitty Films","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1983-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love, eleven years in the making... not that he remembers!","title":"Urusei Yatsura: Only You","video":false,"vote_average":6.446,"vote_count":28}
