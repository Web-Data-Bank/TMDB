With Lum gone, her friends decide that there is no reason to remain, and so Tomobiki slowly returns to normal. The highlight of the film is a high speed chase scene with an angry Lum flying after the mysterious Ruu through the city at night and into a hall of mirrors (and illusion ). Ataru's true feelings for Lum are probably more obvious in this film than any of the others.","popularity":15.921,"poster_path":"/uVVqczwzMpeYH4wVsTUHcqpsNOh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kitty Films","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":6075,"logo_path":"/vlfJrLVL1TeNrCeeLBAwJXNv65M.png","name":"Studio Deen","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urusei Yatsura: Remember My Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.682,"vote_count":11}
