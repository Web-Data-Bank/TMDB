The face remains deathly still other than the occasional blink or involuntary bat of his eyelash. The film is slowed down to about 24-frames per-second to capture these slight movements a bit better, but other than this and the choppy fade-in’s and out’s at the beginning and end respectively, nothing changes throughout the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kxfUvZ8edp487WiqyV71ncK1D9Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andy Warhol Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Screen Test: Helmut","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":7}
