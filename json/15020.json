Nine years later, Donnie is out. He's a different man with only one place to go: back home to the same violent and racist neighborhood that created him. At the other end of town, the black community still wants revenge. The instrument of justice will be Ossie Paris, a devastatingly talented boxer who challenges Donnie to a match; a match Donnie's family and peers won't let him refuse. George Carvery has waited nine years to avenge his son's fate at the hands of Donnie. When finally they meet face to face, however, both realize they share a similar desire to overcome the past.","popularity":2.555,"poster_path":"/4mKbDppyNBwws5e8nH889E4Ejqb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poor Boy's Game","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":15}
