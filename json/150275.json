Day breaks. A woman touches her eyebrows. A man shaves. Chickens are set loose and goats are fed. Little or nothing is said but the soundtrack gradually evolves into a rich, subtle combination of background noise and added sounds. This observation takes on a more contemplative mood, when attention is focused on the other subjects of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2009-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story of a day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
