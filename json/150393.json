The formal aspect in the movie is a lot of trick shots using a mirror, photographs and negatives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5dwmNUo9E3vIF9w27bDhFesUrmr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spółdzielnia Autorow Filmowych","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1937-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of a Good Citizen","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":14}
