One day, a very crucial day in their career, Shabbir does not arrive on time, and when he does, their cab is stuck in a major traffic jam on the highway. The already irate and anxious passengers decide to let Shabbir try an alternate route to the IT Park that will take them through remote villages. But almost as soon as they break from routine and start on this journey, a series of life-altering incidents (and a fakir who challenges them to take time in their own hands), inspires them to change their perspective of life itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hou De Jarasa Ushir","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
