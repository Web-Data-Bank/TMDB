Mutter Krause can't pay back the money she owes the man whose newspapers she delivered and he accuses her of stealing and threatens her with arrest. Mutter Krause must then pawn her last valuable possession, a treasured memento of her late husband. Paul then breaks into the same pawn shop. He gets away but is later arrested. Meanwhile, Erna begins dating a young man with Communist views, who turns Erna to Communism and also helps her earn the money her mother needs by more honest means.","popularity":0.976,"poster_path":"/9k0qhR4RkqR6LPWXf0SwHCr1NWR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prometheus-Film-Verleih","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1929-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The great Zille-movie","title":"Mother Krause's Journey to Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":11}
