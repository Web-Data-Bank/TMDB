Some are mutilated while others have the Price equation (wΔz = Cov (w,z) = βwzVz) carved into their flesh. Detective Eddie Argo and his new partner Helen Westcott unearth the meaning of the odd equation and realise each victim is being offered a gruesome choice: kill your loved ones, or be killed. Before long it becomes clear that the perpetrator has suffered a similar fate and is now coping by seeking a way to solve this philosophical dilemma.","popularity":7.541,"poster_path":"/bf11TuyZCWUnSDaGxsmq4jBrmwx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10393,"logo_path":"/7MazD0kppT5OzdumzDi5IFYNthO.png","name":"Vertigo Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2452,"logo_path":"/6CLoZ59fLPG7UyxQtGTqRevjf58.png","name":"UK Film Council","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":11667,"logo_path":"/dhBJdstAolGmqRfbQfElhsU1cTo.png","name":"Northern Ireland Screen","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":290,"logo_path":"/Q8mw2AOQQc8Qg0uNwLWq86DVZv.png","name":"Ingenious Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Would you kill the one you love to save yourself from death?","title":"WΔZ","video":false,"vote_average":5.453,"vote_count":160}
