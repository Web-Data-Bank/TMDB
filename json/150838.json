From François I's armor to Guynemer's airplane, to Napoleon's and Marshall Foch's tombs. But this is no ordinary tour,it is rather a chilling visit guided by Georges Franju and narrated by Michel Simon emphasizing - at times through biting humor -not the glory but the nonsense of wars, but their tragic aftermath.","popularity":0.758,"poster_path":"/rAVIpNiRmY4B8HWrOBK7wWnehF4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hôtel des Invalides","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":20}
