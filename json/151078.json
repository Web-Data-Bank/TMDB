The music sounds more or less like a Bob James small-group date with Ritenour as a major soloist. The style is between jazz, R&B, and pop with an emphasis on lightweight originals, soulful and moderately funky rhythms, and predictable radio-friendly music. Nothing unexpected occurs, but fans of James and Ritenour should enjoy both this CD and Fourplay in general.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/bGT9bZTV5mKKNVDWznCCVU27Mm9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening of Fourplay","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
