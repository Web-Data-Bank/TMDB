For more than 150 years, logging techniques remained the same. Men cut trees by hand and loaded them on horse-drawn sleds to be hauled over snow to the river. Skilled river drivers maneuvered the logs downstream, risking their limbs and lives every day. This film survives as a record of the long log business.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Stump to Ship","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":8}
