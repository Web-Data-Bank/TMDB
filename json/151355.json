Most have never been available in any home format, and all are presented for the first time in high definition. From the high flying, explosive metal mayhem of STUNT ROCK to THUNDER COPS' disembodied flying head chaos, each 3 minute masterpiece is like a beckoning portal to another, more exciting dimension. It's a crippling overdose of towering flames, mechanized destruction, lurking fear, poor sexual choices and spiritual devastation on an apocalyptic scale. You might want to have a cornea donor standing by just in case...because THIS IS GOING TO BURN!","popularity":1.065,"poster_path":"/l9yR0d8Ulvxq6wz0fdqQvojLa2I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trailer War","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":3}
