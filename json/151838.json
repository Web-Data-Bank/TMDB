After an opening dance, a quartet of beer-drinkers gargles the Volga Boatman song, then another group hauling on a rope sings it (we finally see that the other end of the rope is anchored by a very small dog). A trench-coated bomber sneaks into the palace, where we see Rice-Puddin', the mad monk, cheating at a jigsaw puzzle. He spies the activity in the gypsy camp and orders a henchman to fetch the gypsy girl. The villagers revolt as a result, sending The Mad Monk scrambling on his horse; they stuff a bomb into his pants just as he turns his horse into a helicopter, and it explodes.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/8nqypuOqBJBiiEAPAM7FnHrTG3Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8298,"logo_path":"/r6cuEYq7DqrHCNVa7vSanTS0cuw.png","name":"Warner Bros.
