In his film \"Nichts als die Wahrheit - 30 Jahre Die Toten Hosen\" (\"Nothing but the truth - 30 years Die Toten Hosen\"), established documentary filmmaker Eric Friedler succeeds at presenting an interior view of a band that evolved from an enfant terrible to a pop culture icon and whose work mirrors German history.
