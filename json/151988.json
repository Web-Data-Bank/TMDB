Disharmony begins among the Eagles when they are ordered to kill Shinshu Monster, an ex-colleague of their loud-laughing leader, whom they call Foster Father. Before dying, Shinshu sows the seeds of doubt with the Eagle Yingming who, nearly dead, is nursed back to health by Quihua. Quihua's ill father is another of the Foster Father 's ex-colleagues, and is the holder of the Star Bleed Skill scroll, which the Eagle's leader covets above all else.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/llGvmZBX7Ivg1rJsnY93fzaNeF8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 13 Cold-Blooded Eagles","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
