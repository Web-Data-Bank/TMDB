Mom tells him what a no-account his dad really was, setting sail for Hawaii (\"no, Maw, it was Catalina\") right after the kids were born. Peter is unswayed, and takes off. He turns a barrel into a boat, and crews it with an annoyingly talkative duckling, then sets sail on a lake. They get caught in a thunderstorm (the duck loves it). Peter calls for help and momma comes running, but the duck has already saved him. But he still wants to be a sailor.","popularity":1.583,"poster_path":"/w94NsplX8tPJaxT8BMkkMrO3QjO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Wanna Be a Sailor","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":7}
