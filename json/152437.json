Stolen from their homelands, the fiery Druid maiden Bodicia, exotic slave girl Jessemina, and the powerful barbarian Flavius, are pitted against each other as gladiators by the sadistic Roman Governor Timarchus. Banished by Caesar, Timarchus unleashes his frustration on his gladiators, staging extravagant spectacles of combat, orgy and death. In a violent world where only the strong survive, love and hate, life and death, are separated by an instant.","popularity":3.599,"poster_path":"/jviz09xUUttyS59vIi6VZlSy0FT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1038,"logo_path":"/o62j8ZNXmRTrq6ThviFWiL9zb8J.png","name":"Bazelevs Production","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":4688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Concorde-New Horizons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arena","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":12}
