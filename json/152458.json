In the background are the large rocks and brick wall at the back of the lion's habitat.","popularity":0.897,"poster_path":"/uNCEUulA6nX64OZdIJG2ZjXGkZl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumi√®re","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1896-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lumiere Film Catalog no. 54","title":"Lion, London Zoological Gardens","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":16}
