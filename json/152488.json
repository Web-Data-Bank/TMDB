A hugely influential figure in black American music, he was a driving force in the development of soul music in the early sixties and funk in the early seventies. He has had more R&B hits in the US than any other artist, and has charted singles in countries around the world.  One of the defining elements of James Brown’s career has always been his electrifying live show and his performances at Montreux give ample evidence of this. This DVD focuses on his choice as the best of them all from 1981. It’s a string of hits from start to finish delivered with all the flamboyant style and showmanship for which he is rightly famous.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/9t4qVZZU6aXA8lRVr8EHcYvCnxo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11701,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montreux Jazz Festival","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1981-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Brown: Live at Montreux","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
