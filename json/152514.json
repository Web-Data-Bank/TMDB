Complications abound when Letov attempts to pass off an entire village under the guise of a community wiped out during the Second World War. The arrival of a group of trouble-causing misfits, among them mobster Barukh - who wishes to bury his mother's remains, only to discover that someone keeps exhuming them - and the lech Simon - a Canadian with an insatiable fetish for his sexy translator - turn Letov's latest scheme into a veritable cat's cradle.","popularity":0.618,"poster_path":"/brdP9JQwPa63vqFgApRZZxaJcOb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17084,"logo_path":"/gvpnQhxFbQ6afXjzRKt654HPy7y.png","name":"Catherine Dussart Productions (CDP)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":126927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Karo Premiere","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roots","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":8}
