And although there was a light rain and the concert was entirely outdoors, the huge crowd, some of them with umbrellas, were clearly transported by the music and by the performers who represented a cross-section of the best of classical and jazz artists. The concert started about 10:30am at night and lasted until 1am. And rain or not, it didn't look like anyone left. The audience was considerably younger than one would see at a typical classical music or even a typical jazz concert. And it appeared that everyone was having a marvelous time.","popularity":2.561,"poster_path":"/2G75ALgjZJGsGodcrG10sCK9dPg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swinging Bach: Bobby Mcferrin & Guests","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
