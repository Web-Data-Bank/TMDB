Amidst the madness, Adam, who is well connected but totally broke, is desperately trying to get enough money to marry the beautiful Nina. While his attempts to raise cash are constantly thwarted, their friends seem to self-destruct, one-by-one, in an endless search for newer and faster sensations. Finally, when world events out of their control come crashing around them, they are forced to reassess their lives and what they value most.","popularity":5.813,"poster_path":"/m7ik01FJKBSEoy0L0PKz7eEf9kI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1218,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Film Consortium","origin_country":""},{"id":2452,"logo_path":"/6CLoZ59fLPG7UyxQtGTqRevjf58.png","name":"UK Film Council","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":29018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visionview Production","origin_country":""},{"id":99272,"logo_path":"/xt9cawh63M0bkKrc0VvDtZ8q2sa.png","name":"Icon Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Revolution Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":135268,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doubting Hall Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sex...
