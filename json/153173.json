Machinery assists the bulb manufacture. A virtuoso glassblower begins a more complex tube used in radio broadcasting; it is then turned, fired, and sculpted. Conveyors carry partially completed units. Workers perform their various specific assembly-line tasks. Cases are manufactured and machined, wire harnesses are assembled, loudspeakers are produced. As radios near completion, they are run through a series of tests. Engineers and draughtsmen define future developments. In a closing stop-motion sequence, in a style reminiscent of Norman McLaren, a group of loudspeakers performs a playful dance. The film overall is a poetic depiction of an industrial process.","popularity":0.833,"poster_path":"/4mNVqZeOWV0VcRlqCxXQlows3fL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1931-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philips-Radio","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":14}
