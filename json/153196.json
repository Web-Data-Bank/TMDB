Special attention goes to 'physical' methods of torture in the afterlife, as in Dante's Inferno. Their inspiration stems partially from judicial torments, as used during the Inquisition to redeem 'Satanic' sinners, from witches and heretics to mere gay people. Also treated is hell's theological and 'educational' meaning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"History of Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
