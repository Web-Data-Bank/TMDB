On the first night in her new room, she is awoken by a strange scratching sound coming from the apartment of her neighbor, a reclusive old man who has refused all attempts at communication. Concerned over his well being, Asuka enters his home only to find him dead from malnutrition. Worse, it looks as if he had been trying to claw his way into her room. Asuka learns that there have been a number of strange deaths in the complex over the years from Shinobu, the handyman cleaning up the old man’s apartment. Even the girls at school whisper rumors of it being haunted.","popularity":3.098,"poster_path":"/jRGypGRXaTS6lGh1qkkplSMIRiM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":955,"logo_path":"/5xnXD3PJI1HqOJceSAKZ3fDqO1V.png","name":"Nikkatsu Corporation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3659,"logo_path":"/f3JAZMtnai5X1LOWJncKPDeYsFQ.png","name":"Django Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":1778,"logo_path":"/b5rT6VbYza3LyfltCmz1OcqzWJM.png","name":"dentsu","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":822,"logo_path":"/HF2fFP8MH9juSCoN2VtQCFQYPD.png","name":"Happinet Pictures","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Complex","video":false,"vote_average":4.861,"vote_count":54}
