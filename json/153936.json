They have no idea of just how different and exciting it will be until they meet their substitute teacher, Miss Koala, a true wonder from down under! Miss Koala sure has a different way of doing things. At first the class is a little resistant, but she quickly wins them over with her \"try-anything-once\" attitude.

Now, it's up to Franklin and his friends to win one for their favorite coach before she's off on a new classroom adventure.","popularity":2.105,"poster_path":"/omq8o3oRkoVxOaBsMGJmKYtUcco.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1023,"logo_path":"/dJLh6G11paw58YGYYpcRZiKvzGW.png","name":"Nelvana","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to School with Franklin","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
