The world has changed and he hasn't. He'd like to retire, but if he left the \"family business\" to his two idiot sons, they'd be dead in a minute. So he decides to go legit, which convinces everyone that he must be completely off the deep end. To preserve their cushy lives, his dysfuntional family conspires to get him some psycho-therepy. So his boys kidnap a \"piasan\" shrink and order him to \"fix\" their father. This film, which premired on Showtime, pre-dated the very similarly plotted \"Analyze This\" by over a year.","popularity":1.211,"poster_path":"/xSgj1IXrHluVRkW23DtP7kLyox1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imagination Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Godfather wants to get in touch with his feelings.
