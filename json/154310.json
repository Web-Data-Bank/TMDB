The first vacations in the mountains and his first star seem to have come straight out of our memories so much we find ourselves in them. The first communion and the long sermons of the priest are also crying of truth. And who didn't feel the same feeling of freedom with his first moped. Not to mention the Tuperware meetings. All these memories are evoked with an accent of the south so singing that we like to dive into this universe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Du0c0GlTGx87t3bdg2NsDZiBra.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patrick Bosso - Le spectacle de ma vie","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
