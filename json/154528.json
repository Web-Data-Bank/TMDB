However, the woods are actually teeming with strange characters, some of whom turn out to be disguised police officers and others criminals.

The criminals, on the other hand, are aware that the police are looking for them and doing their best to avoid betraying the location of their stash.","popularity":1.46,"poster_path":"/rqk9SMnCz9LcjfPrA9t53sSyWp5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5846,"logo_path":"/xjhNN5Vz8LcRMtoodiRkZIU4bwa.png","name":"Thames Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1981-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If You Go Down in the Woods Today","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
