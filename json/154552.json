Everything is going for her: she has a successful professional career, loves her family, has enough money for a comfortable life, and has plans for the future. After arriving to the country, a strange feeling takes hold of her. She starts feeling the presence of something that moves the treetops at night, makes the dogs howl, and wanders like the breath of a ghost across the infinite countryside. A stinging feeling that kills all her certainties. In the middle of the night Elisa wakes up. The moonlight shines on her face.","popularity":0.674,"poster_path":"/oip1iTvBeJqgXserIljiGqZGPkU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1042,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinecittà","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":88524,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skydancers","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Open","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":10}
