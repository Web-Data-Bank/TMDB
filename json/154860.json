They're both very much lost in their individual quarter-life crises. Ashley quit his job to travel in search of clarity. He ventures to his childhood home with plans of breaking-and-entering for the nostalgic rush. Along the way he meets Holly, who, after a short-lived relationship with her restaurant manager, also finds herself jobless and aimless. The film chronicles Holly and Ashley's brief, odd, hysterical commiseration as grown-up children stumbling through life's final bout of growing pains.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5ucq7OUBxAywoiikNTL6tLaEyDI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Must Come Down","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
