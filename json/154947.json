I'm A Rebel  This DVD is jam-packed with U.D.O. goodies and the most interesting one is certainly the \"Live in Russia\" concert recorded in 2001. The overall picture is very average but acceptable (with sometimes some annoying black and white and distorted effects), and the sound is rather surprisingly good for a 2.0 audio mix. However, the footage is limited to only nine tracks - a 45 minutes set list, instead of a full concert. I would have preferred to have an entire gig and fewer extras. Nevertheless, the gig is awesome and it's so great to see U.D.O. perform their songs and the Accept ones so well and accurately.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qEOspfGJAfThgLhyIew7qLstl9W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"U.D.O.: Nailed to metal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
