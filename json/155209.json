A time of hair bands and their ludicrous MTV videos filled with spandex-clad band members and skimpily clad bimbos. Kiss: Exposed returns us to that forgettable era, as Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons show how to desperately try to remain cock rock's elder statesmen. This 1987 compilation serves up several now-hilarious video clips from Kiss's '80s \"unmasked\" period, including \"Tears Are Falling,\" \"Heaven's on Fire,\" \"Lick It Up,\" and \"I Love It Loud.\" (Count the fires burning in these classic video relics of days gone by!) Also on hand are Stanley and Simmons themselves, looking properly embarrassed as they act out rock's biggest fantasy: lounging by the pool with a bevy of (mostly) bare beauties. The saving grace is the generous selection of vintage live performances: hearing the band do \"Strutter,\" \"Detroit Rock City,\" \"Ladies Room,\" and \"Deuce\" in its late-'70s prime is worth wading through the outdated '80s-style power pop... if you're a real Kiss fan, of course.","popularity":1.33,"poster_path":"/8oqSfEWc2RxqtZoHalc2rfHZkPK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiss Exposed","video":true,"vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":4}
