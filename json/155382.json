He doesn't know why and she can't explain it. Some time can mean so many things. How much time apart? A week, a month, years? During this imprecise period of uncertainty, Boris is left at the mercy of chance. His life transforms into an erratic urban journey: moving into a transient hotel, buying a temperamental communist-era car, meeting up with a long-lost classmate, random encounters with other women and repeatedly trying to get back together with Ana.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6BTDDI104m9VYcciouAwO3TUa3L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7977,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rizoma Films","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":18485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rohfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mysterious World","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
