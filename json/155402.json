An initially reserved Albert Hall crowd quickly responds to the uptempo excitement the band create, cast aside their inhibitions and make this a real party - some even joining the band on stage at one point. Originally formed in Miami in 1989 The Mavericks were the premier alternative country /tex-mex band of the 90's, with no fewer than 14 Billboard chart singles and 6 albums to their credit. The band finally split up in 2003, and this 59 minute DVD displays them at their best with all their hits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8WHZmfigI9Yn5wnSyjIhMqX71nt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mavericks - Live at the Royal Albert Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
