In the late 1950s, the city of Santiago de Cuba was afire, the site of some of the fiercest resistance to the murderous dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. The film's narrative unfolds over 24 hours in the lives of several youthful members of the underground as they confront their own uncertainty about the morality of armed struggle and the necessity of severing bonds that had seemed unbreakable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2fmY42Sq16dSFEwZ5P4EiXYb0rh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City in Red","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
