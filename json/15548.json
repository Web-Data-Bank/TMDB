Celebrating the four elements as represented in four colours  – blue (air), green (water), red (fire) and ochre (earth) – Dralion combines ancient Chinese circus traditions with Cirque du Soleil's usual stunning elements: the techno-oriented single ring; the multicoloured lights and costumes; the music that mixes rock, New Age and various world influences (though not Chinese); and the madcap clowns that pull a victim out of the audience.","popularity":1.284,"poster_path":"/fl5qaYXKUEWN2mKKjHRgF8qxXWp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cirque du Soleil Images","origin_country":""},{"id":5230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Serpent Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ignite your senses and behold the wonder","title":"Cirque du Soleil: Dralion","video":false,"vote_average":7.167,"vote_count":9}
