The concert was in celebration of the fiftieth birthday of Hassanal Bolkiah, the Sultan of Brunei and was attended by the Brunei royal family.  Much of the concert resembled Jackson's Dangerous World Tour, including his outfit, stage, and the setlist, keeping the details of the upcoming HIStory Tour a close secret. This concert was not part of the Dangerous World Tour nor the History World Tour. The concert also marked the debut live performance of \"You Are Not Alone\" and \"Earth Song\" as well as the last performances of \"Jam\", \"Human Nature\", \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" and \"She's Out of My Life\" at a Jackson concert. This concert was also among the last performances of \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\" being sung fully live; most subsequent performances have been partially lip-synched.","popularity":0.774,"poster_path":"/wh0EWNj12AecV2zHOZj2Rf8wY36.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael Jackson live in Brunei Royal Concert 1996","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":5}
