The brothers include a would-be tough guy thug, a sleazy lawyer and an anarchist. The anarchist and the sister (Maria Strzelecka) have a thing for each other that is more than just sibling affection. Each of them is facing a problem of their own making. A lot depends on how they deal with their issues, as there isn't much lower they can stoop other than being dead. In the beginning of the film there is a lot going on, which makes it a little hard to follow, but that goes along with the theme of chaos.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/rgCCVfxIFN6Taurx2okP32TzLjS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11894,"logo_path":null,"name":"SPI International","origin_country":""},{"id":266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agencja Produkcji Filmowej","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":37732,"logo_path":"/596Eq7ivA0DpNfB5zzDU7yMeTB4.png","name":"WFDiF","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2006-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chaos","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
