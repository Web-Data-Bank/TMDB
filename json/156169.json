AMERICAN PASSAGES is an associative journey through the United States: a disillusioned Iraq veteran, gay adoptive fathers, black judges, white party animals and a pimp at a casino table in Las Vegas. The extreme contrasts of black and white, rich and poor, winners and losers are often as surprising as the meaning of the constitutional right to the pursuit of happiness in these times of crisis. An epic panorama of America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zBZyUsLGgQ6hPStrDJV9yfGMCD1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruth Beckermann Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2011-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Passages","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
