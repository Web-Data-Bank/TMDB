In locations throughout the world where Ms. Caballé sang, we hear interviews with Ms. Caballé, her family, and by opera and music giants like Claudio Abbado, José Carreras, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Plácido Domingo, Renée Fleming, Dame Joan Sutherland, and Zubin Mehta, also appearing often in clips showing joint collaborations. Of these, the film includes passages from Caballé's most acclaimed roles such as \"Norma\"', \"Tosca\" , \"Turandot\" and her earliest recorded live performance (1966) as \"Anne Boleyn,\" in addition to poignant and powerful live concert duets with fellow Spaniards Plácido Domingo, Juan Pons, and José Carreras.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":"/hfb4HxcIGqxdrseOq7axQG6RR4t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caballe beyond music","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
