That's enough for them. Now they're off to bag themselves a moose, a bear, a fox, a lion, a leopard. It doesn't much matter as long as a fur coat will bag Betty. But neither of them are especially competent at the sport. Koko has to put up with a moose that fires back; while Bimbo suffers the wrath of a lion who multiplies after being shot. And neither hunter accounts for Betty's fickleness or her kind heart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kqUagu57acLPzjnpeLF4CCGA9EJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hunting We Will Go","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
