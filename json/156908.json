The Board of a local team puts all their eggs in the new season trebling their budget. Unknowingly it hires an uneasy twosome as the new manager and new coach for the team. The airlift from America, Europe and even Africa hauls in player after player when the coach burns the money that never realizes. The tragicomic efforts of the manager to gather the unrealistic budget and even to find a washing-machine for the players evolve into an anatomy of inflamed working environment. The manager's power-struggle with the coach has a bitter end where there's only space for one of them in the town. The player-candidates come with high hopes and end up being the pawns in the game. Their life among the locals create absurd encounters that originate from all walks of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":175689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kuvaputki","origin_country":""},{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2009-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Basket Case","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
