The reporter digs up dirt on the past life of a local hotel owner, and wanting to take full advantage of the muck, he strings out his revelations in a series of perjorative, damning articles on the man. The result of this campaign turns out to be much worse than simply ruining the hotel owner's reputation.","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":"/3xUFT8vKJlJedvePNsNqG947j3b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmaufbau","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1959-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Sold Himself","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
