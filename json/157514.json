Established as one of Virgin Classics’ bestselling artists, Jaroussky, now aged 34, has been honoured three times in the Victoires de la Musique awards in his native France and has also received Germany’s most prominent music prize, the Echo Klassik. His diverse achievements are saluted in two new collections on Virgin Classics – the 2CD set “The Voice” and the DVD and Blu Ray “La Voix des rêves: Greatest moments in Concert”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ykA2O3a3rS4FUXaRnoGKoc6nqCA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philippe Jaroussky: Greatest Moments in Concert (La voix des rêves)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
