In 1942, after the occupation of Holland, its function was reversed by the Nazis and it became a 'transit camp.' In 1944, the camp commander commissioned a film, shot by a photographer, Rudolph Breslauer. â€œBy exhuming the scattered fragments and traces of the phantom film (intertitle cards, ideas for the scenario, graphic elements), Harun Farocki inscribes the Dutch footage within the genre of the corporate film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4sN1SiKejaS6a8oIsBMSliggsbu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harun Farocki Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2007-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Respite","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7}
