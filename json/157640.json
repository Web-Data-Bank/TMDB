This loss of bearings was to change forever our way of deciphering what we see. The image is no longer used only as testimony, but also as an indispensable link in a process of production and destruction. This is the central premise of \"War at a Distance\", which continues the deconstruction of claims to visual objectivity Harun Farocki developed in his earlier work. With the help of archival and original material, Farocki sets out in effect to define the relationship between military strategy and industrial production and sheds light on how the technology of war finds applications in everyday life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5geet8MVyKUuQCzPZQ2gr2xU0HJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harun Farocki Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War at a Distance","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
