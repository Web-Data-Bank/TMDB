During the long journey, as the passengers mentally sort out their past & their future, things happen in the present, by choice or by providence, that make their journey memorableâ€”the bus blows a tire, a song elicits tears, a butterfly causes commotion, a picture gets lost, someone's head is stoned, some hearts are broken, some mended. The bus ride poetizes the life journey and poses questions on issues of life and death and where exactly the line is drawn between free will and destiny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21293,"logo_path":"/zF9tH0KxU26u93AOSb4pd7KXSD2.png","name":"Quantum Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2009-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biyaheng Lupa","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
