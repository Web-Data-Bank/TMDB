A woman is at his bedside, calling him Assanee. But that's not his name. His name is Her Sue Yong. And besides, he can't speak Thai. He leaps from his bed and runs, and the nurses give chase.  In Taiwan, he was a bedraggled, long-haired scavenger. He had a disfigured face. But in Thailand, the skin on his face is smooth and his hair is short. He's a clean-cut young man with a beautiful wife. And he has a job as a civil servant in a government office. His inability to speak Thai is no problem at work. Heck, there's even a deaf-mute on the staff. All Assanee has to do is wait for people to hand him forms, and he stamps them. Seems easy enough.","popularity":0.883,"poster_path":"/fMgxGVsW4hwy4lzgMLMAK6sIpGv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2009-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fatality","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
