The music of Mozart has quite literally been an essential driving force of Daniel Barenboim’s entire life. It remains central to his performing career both as a pianist and as a conductor.  These illuminating performances of Mozart’s last eight great piano concertos admirably demonstrate Barenboim’s dictum that even when a true musician has already performed a familiar work hundreds of times, he or she ‘never accepts that the next note will be played the same way as it was played before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":255,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barenboim plays Mozart","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
