There were riders — courageous, driven and a little crazy — who were at once exploring new terrain, testing their own limitations and defining a new genre of the sport, and their riding style was not represented at all in competition. Freeride mountain biking was rapidly evolving with every insane drop and first descent, and Red Bull Rampage was on board to help push it even harder.  The inaugural event was a landmark in the sport’s history and was followed by three more through 2004.","popularity":0.93,"poster_path":"/uuQupignhVEYV8V66V39KzBS422.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7724,"logo_path":"/6QV240fIM04sZXpyLUoqhKGhf7r.png","name":"Red Bull Media House","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":188973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prime To Go","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2012-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Bull Rampage 2012","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
