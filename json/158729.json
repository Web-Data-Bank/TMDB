She's now convicted and because of this uncooperative attitude gets the maximum sentence, 10 years in a women's jail wing. Model husband Larry, who wasn't informed of her dumb schemes is left running her appeal, the household and spoiled daughter who now feels abandoned.

Larry however has his own radio show, so it all hangs on gathering proof.","popularity":1.574,"poster_path":"/2E8SzOAcGNR7DstksqMYhoKTUjr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carroll Newman Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hearst Entertainment Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She witnessed the unthinkable...
