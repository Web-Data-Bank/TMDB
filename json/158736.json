He meets with the Executive Director, Anekta Kapoor, and after going through various formalities - including having his Kundali/Astrological Chart approved - he is hired and instructed to increase the firm's TRP's with a good day-time soap. With all ideas already being telecast by Ekta Kapoor and Balaji Telefilms, he is at a loss and encounters writers' block. This issue resolves itself after he meets with his neighbor, Sumana Roy Chowdhury, and decides to write a story about the two of them. His work is accepted, initial episodes are telecast, and the ratings do surge upwards - but not for long - as soon Sumana finds out, confronts him, the duo find they are attracted to each other and get married. The question remains: with the two getting married, how will the show and the remainder of the episodes proceed?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sqSSJLBZOB6Po8DgpI0obUzipuD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idiot Box","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
