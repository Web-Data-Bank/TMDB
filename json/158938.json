His mother, who is approaching eighty, visits him every week. Suzanne, Pierre's current wife, has moved on since he was sent away. Each character gives us a frank account of a period in their lives that seems suspended in time by the fragile connection between life on the inside and the world outside. Their destinies are linked by crime, guilt and loneliness, and like casualties of love and desire, they are dying to stick their heads above the water and breathe the air of life.","popularity":0.78,"poster_path":"/csqCKXgafd0BHOtXIUrWWT8FZmf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48246,"logo_path":"/rYJHpNBepGMEoPhObLlOGOK7BVy.png","name":"Films 53/12","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Meteor","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
