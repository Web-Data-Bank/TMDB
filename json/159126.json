Desperate for some chow, they opt to impersonate a police officer and a baby, two types of diners most likely to get offered freebies. When that fails, they go to the food-chain source, posing as a cow. Yet more misadventures ensue before the duo finds itself chased by a latterday edition of producer Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops. Director Del Lord was a former Keystone Kop who helmed many of the Three Stooges' most beloved comedies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t1EF9QzM8HihvvRoiRtuAH8tc7e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mack Sennett Comedies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wandering Willies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
