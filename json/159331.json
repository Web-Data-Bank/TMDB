Some people had thought of this release as a more modern Live from Antarctica. Unlike Live from Antarctica, this DVD was limited in release to the latter \"Mock the Vote\" concerts in 2004 and 2005. In June 2007, Don Drakulich (Sleazy P. Martini) began selling a new DVD-R pressing of this show through his Hypereal Productions web page. The 2007 version featured a new cover and menus, and corrected audio problems that were found in the original.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gwar - War Party Tour 2004","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
