The images include women spinning on cotton wheels, families making traditional tteok (rice cakes), a look at Dongsomun (Seoulâ€™s ancient East Gate), which was destroyed just years later, and missionary activities in what is now North Korean territory.  The footage was once stored in a German monastery, but later the Nazi government, which sided with Japan in World War II, tried to confiscate it because some of it could be interpreted as espousing a critical view toward the Japanese occupational regime in Korea. Fortunately, a monk saved the film, hiding it behind a stone wall in the basement before he died during the war. The film was rediscovered in 1975 during a renovation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Lande der Morgenstille","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
