The advertising satire follows the New York firm of Cranston & Co. as they fight rival Hoffman & Partners. Cranston fires his creative director which puts a young copywriter with a literature degree on the front line, even though he doesn't want to be. The contest comes down to a schmaltzy campaign by Hoffman with music by Air Supply that uses the tagline \"Vorcan: your own personal air supply.\" or a more down to earth campaign from Cranston of \"The pad ain't bad!\"","popularity":3.06,"poster_path":"/mTRUTJGwuTr8oj9Ph92DdJsx2Ub.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tenafly Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
