Director Andrej Lettrich's novel adaptation talks of plotting, forbidden love. family discord, and struggle for heritage and power. The story is engaging thanks to the impressive performances of popular actors, dramatic situations, and sensitive music. Red Wine is not so much inventive in terms of auteurship as it is a work of excellent craftsmanship. The resulting picture is a costume production neatly adapted to the character of Slovak rural life in the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ykULJlYfVuGmcom9WsMFYbFX1AQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Wine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
