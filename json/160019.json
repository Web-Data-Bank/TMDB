Only a former SEAL, now a submarine consultant, can save the crew by sliding aboard while the sub is underwater. The term \"crash dive\" refers to the sudden dropping of a sub to escape detection, an act that a nuclear sub is never supposed to make. Of course, it comes into play in this film.","popularity":4.504,"poster_path":"/3L7bHgxFZ36bOxEoK9q0piAbuRx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11130,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal Oaks Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Destination: Washington D.C.
