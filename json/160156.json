The incident unleashes his latent personality disorder. Plagued by self-doubt, he strives for cleanliness and perfection and is obsessed with trying to control everything around him. His compulsion draws Aslan, who lives with his grandmother in a village in Kazakhstan, into increasingly difficult situations. He abhors the way most of his fellow pupils are held in the sway of a criminal scheme, in which Bolat, one of Aslan’s tormentors, is also involved. Bolat blackmails the younger children into paying him protection money; he has nothing but contempt for ostracised Aslan.","popularity":2.422,"poster_path":"/9G0c48Bigr6faFB7jJdGV10clHq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16906,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arizona Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":3623,"logo_path":"/v3XJT8ci1OScqcMOqd6uAExJCcV.png","name":"Kazakhfilm Studios","origin_country":"KZ"},{"id":11009,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Post Republic","origin_country":""},{"id":18485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rohfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harmony Lessons","video":false,"vote_average":7.24,"vote_count":25}
