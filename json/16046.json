All they want is to re-start the silent machines. But this simple act - the take - has the power to turn the globalization debate on its head. Armed only with slingshots and an abiding faith in shop-floor democracy, the workers face off against the bosses, bankers and a whole system that sees their beloved factories as nothing more than scrap metal for sale.","popularity":1.789,"poster_path":"/5QiQFidOptA8MaScRu70n2nR6BZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Occupy.
