Ades's Asyla (the plural of \"Asylum,\" used in both its meanings, as a place of refuge and a scene of madness) is available only in the video format, which is sonically quite good and visually striking. It is energetic music, with a lot of percussion, including one piece that looks like a tomato juice can, and one movement that annotator Andrew Porter describes as \"a sort of Rite of Spring cum disco.\" A video interview of Rattle is a fine bonus. --Joe McLellan","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7lAh0BuWAMHqQfQUvPlpDAeOUik.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":194,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mahler's 5th Symphony","title":"Mahler Symphony No. 5 & Ades Asyla","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
