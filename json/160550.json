Tolstoy must explain to them that it is his wife who has authority over their land-holdings, and she will not help them. Stung by their negative reaction to him, Tolstoy becomes increasingly preoccupied with the problems of the poor. This leads to a number of conflicts with his wife, and then to a deep despondency, as the noted writer continues vainly to search for answers to the sufferings he sees around him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jcrH0sYhdakhIkFxXk4gbT7EFnl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thiemann \u0026 Reinhardt","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1912-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Departure of a Great Old Man","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":5}
