I'm often asked, \"What is your favorite moment during the 30 years you hosted The Tonight Show?\" I really don't have just one. The times I enjoyed the most were the spontaneous, unplanned segments that just happened, like Ed Ames' infamous \"Tomahawk Toss\" that produced one of the longest laughs in television history. When these lucky moments happen, you just go with them, and enjoy the experience and high of the moment.  And of course, the planned moments bring their own surprises. Little did we suspect that when Tiny Tim married Miss Vicki on our show that, outside of man's first walk on the moon, it would become the most watched event of the year. And with Leno's and Letterman's first appearances on The Tonight Show... Well, look at them now!  I hope this collection of moments from The Tonight Show of the '60s & '70s includes some of your favorites.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aPnLflr99O6vrDLR0b69hDLiffC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnny Carson - His Favorite Moments from 'The Tonight Show' - '60s & '70s: Heeere's Johnny!","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
