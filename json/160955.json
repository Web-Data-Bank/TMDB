He never goes out with friends, spends his spare time in his room and peeks at the hotel's guests out of boredom and curiosity. Chased by his controlling mother, who only wants him to finish his homework, James is more interested in the group of handsome Swedish soccer players staying at the hotel. When he finds one of the boys injured at the hotel's swimming pool, James offers his help and smuggles the boy into his room and locks the door. Locked up with a strange boy in his own room, James experiences the complexity of his own sexual feelings for the first time.","popularity":1.598,"poster_path":"/hJoCmPVqa2ZxVKqO0n49fVpKtx5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chimney Film","origin_country":""},{"id":93646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Utrecht School of the Arts","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2012-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":17}
