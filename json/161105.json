For some time, his name was synonymous with speed, endurance and grace – if you did something the way Nurmi ran, you did good. But Nurmi's story had its more depressing side: He was accused of violating his amateur status. He died in disgrace, if fondly remembered.  PAAVO NURMI – THE MAN AND HIS TIMES is not so much a portrait of the runner as a vision of his time(s): Here, Nurmi is an icon, an epitome. More than most other works by von Bagh, this one has a strident rigor to it, a focused sense of ritual that fits the subject perfectly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paavo Nurmi - The Man and His Times","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
