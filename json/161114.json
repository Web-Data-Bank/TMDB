A relocated Hercules (KIRK MORRIS of The Witch's Curse) arrives on the scene and sets off to find a kidnapped Nomad princess. He follows her abductors past the Mountain of the Dead, through the City of the Phantoms, to a mysterious castle which turn out to be Atlantis. As if all this wasn't strange enough, Hercules will encounter gold-painted, blue body stocking-wearing, reanimated dead guys; female guards (who are killed if they taste the love of a man); a dying evil queen and her Ming the Merciless wanna-be sorcerer-scientist; and a torturous climax.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":"/efhMKdjKWQBnDCr95PhEoEyMzVA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Conqueror of Atlantis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
