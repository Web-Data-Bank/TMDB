He goes to his throne and summons his jester, Goopy Geer. A black knight arrives and threatens one of the young ladies in court; Goopy fights him off, first with an ax, then in armor from kitchen utensils, then butting him with a mounted animal head, which makes the knight's armor fall apart. He pulls it together again and runs away.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hCloRGHORJJVCgP6uNlKz1qTp3B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":9329,"logo_path":"/aue5pVfj9TcjYEOufkcuCbAL5hE.png","name":"The Vitaphone Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":106840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harman-Ising Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen Was in the Parlor","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":9}
