Brutal wars have just ended in an uneasy peace between Protestant Sweden and Orthodox Russia. We focus on the spiritual defeats of two conquered Finnish brothers, one a hardened near-psychopathic war hero, the other a gentle scientist in an age with no use for such men. They find themselves in the swampy interior, demarcating the new border with a unit of sadistic Russians.","popularity":5.171,"poster_path":"/9OnBhOx8kAyA3BLi8bx83L2dQbA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bronson Club","origin_country":""},{"id":144723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Etic Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2008-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cleanse Your Sins","title":"Sauna","video":false,"vote_average":6.154,"vote_count":94}
