The buffoonish \"Injuns\" drive them to a log cabin with their arrows, and there's a grand shootout. Eventually, though, they are tied to a stake with whooping, war-chanting, Indians threatening to make an end of them... until the woodland creatures mount a counter-offensive to free them. The Indians get the tar knocked out of them as they flee the countryside. A cabin slides off a cliff and goes ker-blooie!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pale-Face","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
