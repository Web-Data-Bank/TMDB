A woman friend from a temperance union loans him a buck. He goes to a bar and orders a glass of milk to get a free sandwich. After he loses the greenback, the burly saloon keeper confiscates Harry's sandwich and tells him to sweep the floor to pay his tab. In the back room is a boxing ring where the owner stages fights. By happenstance, Harry ends up in the ring. Outside, the temperance union pickets the saloon.
