Cedric himself takes on topics such as Bill Clinton, the death penalty, reality television, fast-food chicken, church etiquette, and much more. The other comedians are a mixed lot: Roland Powell amusingly mocks insecure boyfriends and sings a singles bar pick-up song and Juan Villareal gets some laughs out of food stamps and The Blair Witch Project, while Tony Luewellyn flounders through weak material about Ex-Lax and the war on terror. Then along comes J.J., who gives a surreal spin to roadkill and giving birth to septuplets.","popularity":1.215,"poster_path":"/mpmgoNsshgYA66nncdsGecKmu74.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cedric the Entertainer: Starting Lineup","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
