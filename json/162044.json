For the first time ever, fans of The Animal can relive his storied career with this 3-DVD set that includes a biography of Batista s life both inside the ring and out. In addition to this revealing look at The Animal, this 3-DVD set will feature dozens of the greatest matches and moments from Batista s career.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/gGZVn5YcKFawLTzgNioejis8M5T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13651,"logo_path":"/rVJkMs9cSaE1BQoPiDcH6OxmaVZ.png","name":"WWE Home Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Batista - I Walk Alone","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":7}
