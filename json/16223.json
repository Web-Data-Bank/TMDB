Tommy (Nicholas Wright) is a new arrival in his parents' hometown of Hatley, whose mother recently died. He discovers, after the fact, that his mom was once a chess pro and thus a legend in the community. Tommy's chess-fixated peers accept him almost instantly, inferring that he must have inherited his dear mother's skills, but in time Tommy carves out a niche for himself independently of his mom's legacy, and strikes up an enduring romance with Hyacinthe (Rachelle Lefevre) a \"chess cheerleader.\" Two fictional British filmmakers \"frame\" the tale by filming it for a documentary that they are producing, and thus provide witty, ongoing narration.","popularity":0.952,"poster_path":"/nbz8qGqSq3FnwyopPBPuhQH85uE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hatley High","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
