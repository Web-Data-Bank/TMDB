As a contrast against Istanbul's status as a center of historical religious conflict, Pialat — drawing here on texts by the French poet Gérard de Nerval — also describes the city as a place of strange ethnic and religious harmony, with representatives of various cultures and religions living in close contact. He emphasizes the city's hybrid culture, its blend of Southern European and Arab influences, reflected in both its people and its very construction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fPHxFGJHUFsCIMcFdlbXafW9uhZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Como Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12243,"logo_path":"/hztlrOaMK77kKdErDwogso0m2YS.png","name":"Lux Compagnie Cinématographique de France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"documentary short","title":"Golden Horn","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":7}
