Right before they commit the crime, Juanjo informs Tony that his prostitute sister wants him to take her young daughter Laura to visit the girl's father, a flamenco singer in the Spanish southern coastal town of Tarifa. Juanjo persuades the initially reluctant Tony that Laura will provide the couple with a perfect cover after they relieve their partners of the robbery's earnings. Unfortunately, though the robbery comes off without a hitch, the duplicitous Juanjo absconds with the cash, making Tony and Laura fugitives both from the law and from the psychotically angry Maxi and Moco.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qfwvI8SkaU6pxOrsFZanpMm6cQ5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2000-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fugitives","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
