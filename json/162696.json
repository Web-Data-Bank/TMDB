The toymaker goes up to bed, leaving his wind-up policeman to guard the shop, and the other toys come to life. First order of business: throw that pesky cop into the glue pot. The wind-up soldiers march around. They pass a doll, and the lead soldier stops them so he can go woo her. He has some success, until they are threatened by an elephant; he sucks up the other soldiers, and our hero cowers in fear. Then a monkey attacks, and our soldier continues not to be brave.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tlnUKbSdgcTUXMgpuLIC7n5KaVN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Beuren Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Toytown Tale","video":false,"vote_average":4.25,"vote_count":4}
