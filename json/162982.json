She's under the guardianship of her aunt, Madame Tien, who shuffles her between two jobs - working in a pig farm, and cleaning dishes in a rundown restaurant. Tien is also involved in a 'baby factory' scheme, pairing young women with migrant workers and then selling the babies for money. Both survive with each other in a love-hate symbiotic manner, until a truth about her aunt is revealed to Ping Ping.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rSwLToj2r2MisaB6I36mh1f8NYD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenlight Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":53158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ando Laboratory","origin_country":""},{"id":114822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waseda University Ando Laboratory","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2010-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tiger Factory","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
