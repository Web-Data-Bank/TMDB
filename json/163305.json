She recently lost her father and is now on her own. María came to visit her, to keep her company and take a break from the boyfriend she's on the point of leaving. Neither has the wherewithal to comfort the other. Neither knows what they want. They barely know what they don't want. They don't want to go back to their lives. They don't want to think about the future. They don't want to be alone. They don't want their holiday to end. A timber yard about to close, a horse and a dog, a few men, a little alcohol and the cold waters of the southern lakes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What I Love the Most","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
