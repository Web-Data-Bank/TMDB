With a magical-realist flourish the bar itself becomes a character, narrating what happens when a weekly party (organized by Director Wu Tsang, DJs NGUZUNGUZU, and Total Freedom) called Wildness explodes into creativity and conflict. What does \"safe space\" mean? Who needs it? And how does it differ among us? At the Silver Platter, the search for answers creates coalitions across generations.","popularity":1.152,"poster_path":"/rKWhKAQNZwsdksPhCNrXZhJ0ciV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176558,"logo_path":null,"name":"Class Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":192151,"logo_path":null,"name":"Now Unlimited","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wildness","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
