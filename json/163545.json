His temper gets the best of him, so he's seeing a psychotherapist who finds the anger and the impotence related. She recommends that Frank and Lee hire a mysterious European woman to lead them through fantasies intended to unlock passion and help them heal. At the same time this is going on, the police are investigating a series of stabbings: as corpses pile up, we wonder if Frank's temper may be behind this; or perhaps it's Eric, a cross-dressing neighbor and friend of Lee's; it may even be the European woman, who keeps popping up with new fantasies.","popularity":1.651,"poster_path":"/88SkTfSYVrAYvhsoAHW4ZANabIZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinépix","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":69819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Télé-Métropole","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"},{"id":33011,"logo_path":null,"name":"Outrage Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Surrogate","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
