The year is 1968; Marc is adrift in the city after failing in his efforts to gain national acceptance for gay rights. One day, during a park pick-up, he meets Andre, a small town factory worker still exploring his sexuality but convinced that he will one day marry and start a family. Over the course of the next three years, Marc and Andre continue their heated affair as Marc continues to advocate fiercely for gay rights while butting heads with his close-minded father, a Paris police officer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tjolh8mUlMfj2OHihorLh222mlO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144589,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Contraire","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ma saison super 8","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":7}
