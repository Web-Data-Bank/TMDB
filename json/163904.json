The film aesthetic of the anti-Haider activists contrasts to today's official news footage. This gives emphasis to the multilayered clash of different political visions that occurred throughout the decade. In this sense the archive footage does not just transport information about the events it depicts, but though the contrasting materiality encapsulates the tensions between its many creators.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Widerstand in Haiderland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
