Her career foremost in her mind, she doesn't slow down even for a minute, despite her pregnancy. She is, however, taking Lamaze classes and is quite competently coping with the romantic attentions of a man she's not very interested in. It's not at all irrelevant that her news beat includes stories on terrorism, the greenhouse effect, pollution and genetic engineering, because when her baby's due date comes and goes, she starts hearing from her infant from in the womb. It is telling her that it and many other babies are refusing to be born into such a horrible world. She learns that this is true, and that the children born through induced labor are dying.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avanti Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11796,"logo_path":"/tx6LOQcTSqgW8ffKxovuJHjlYVw.png","name":"Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel de la FWB","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":138483,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Latierre Natine","origin_country":""},{"id":138484,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Source Perier","origin_country":""},{"id":1016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Man's Films","origin_country":""},{"id":8278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministerie van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap","origin_country":""},{"id":54900,"logo_path":"/yCYeqZosRZFwBNJK4clARa3E4la.png","name":"Nederlandse Omroepstichting (NOS)","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":134147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radio Télévision Luxembourg - Télévision Indépendante (RTL-TVI)","origin_country":""},{"id":82439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sabre TV","origin_country":""},{"id":55248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tchin Tchin Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11619,"logo_path":"/lpjHtqZkBZflKjCe33nHXKF7YNV.png","name":"Belgische Radio en Televisie","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1992-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Heaven and Earth","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
