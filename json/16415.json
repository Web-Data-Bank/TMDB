After Sweet gets drunk one night at his birthday party, he misses a sportscast and his boss, Bryce Williams demotes him to interviewer and promotes Weedle. A subplot of the film are two robbers, \"Bossy\" and \"Savage\" who the main characters remain remotely unaware of as they are just a comic theme. Sweet pulls a prank on Weedle during a golf game and is suspended for six month. Sweet also records Weedle having humorous intercourse with a prostitute, \"The Orphan in a Storm\". Sweet then decides to drown his sorrows in a casino at the slot machines, where he tricks a small boy, Alfred \"Shorty\" Short into thinking he is a genie. Bossy and Savage try to rob the casino when they accidentally break the disco ball and it knocks Sweet unconscious just as he hits the jackpot.","popularity":1.747,"poster_path":"/mLn4VCI8fDXzv7jLXAz0yVYX1aG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1991-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet 'n Short","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":5}
