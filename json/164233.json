These dreams become reality when they photograph a gigantic fish leaping out of the sea and their small town blossoms into a tourist hot-spot as a result. But for Mbwana, the reality isn't what he dreamed â€“ and when he meets the fish again, both of them forgotten, ruined and old, he decides only one of them can survive. Jonah is a big fish story about the old and the new, and the links and the distances between them. A visual feast, shot though with humour and warmth, it tells an old story in a completely new way.","popularity":3.756,"poster_path":"/dMVWHs7dPClSQFiHfZcFbjcYrwy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16877,"logo_path":"/pR2SnHFl7BvRIUuauFJrxXFYjeU.png","name":"BFI Film Fund","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16878,"logo_path":null,"name":"Factory Fifteen","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16879,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jellyfish Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16880,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shine Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16881,"logo_path":"/6YneeRD8rMcsYnEnmRPrLYyuiia.png","name":"Stray Bear Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When two young men photograph a gigantic fish leaping from the sea, their small town becomes a tourist attraction in this story about the old and the new.","title":"Jonah","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":18}
