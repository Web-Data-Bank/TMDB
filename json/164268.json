We learn where the name came from and why the Directors Guild of America (DGA) first allowed his name to be used on Richard Widmark's western Death of a Gunfighter. The film follows the numerous problems that director Tony Kaye had during the production and post-production of the film American History X and why the DGA refused to allow Alan Smithee to be credited for that film.","popularity":0.981,"poster_path":"/jYO995OMK6WnO80NWdiRkqrGQOF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Winstar Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":143180,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orchard Films","origin_country":""},{"id":181666,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMC Original Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Directed by Alan Smithee","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":9}
