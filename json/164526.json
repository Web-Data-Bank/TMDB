Her mother, Dr. Janet Fraser, thinks that she can bond with her stepfather by accompanying mom and dad on a simple business excursion to see if a small tour guide company is a good investment for clients. The fact that the trip will take the threesome to the site of a volcano in New Zealand is nothing for Melanie to worry about. Old \"Mount Extreme\" is inactive and mom is a former volcanologist who should know a safe hill when she sees one. So what's the problem? Answer: somebody forgot to tell the gods in charge of lava control that they were about to host a family therapy session. Mount Extreme decides to live up to its name just in time to make Melanie's quality time with the folks seem like a big mistake.","popularity":2.487,"poster_path":"/b17fY5XFA87dhMlEB3j8z95PHp8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regent Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":8898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daybreak Pacific","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terror Peak","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":6}
