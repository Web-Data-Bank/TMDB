It’s just the old badger game. And if you do give her money and her name is Sharon Mills (CLAUDINE BENET, an angular blonde with hefty hooters and a divine ass) then you must be Ed Garner, victim of these lewd and larcenous Love Games... Suspecting a scam, Ed — a married, middle-aged man — seeks help from private detective Rick \"The Dick\" Taylor,a hard-drinking, wise-cracking, ex-actor who believes there’s \"nothing like getting laid in the line of duty.\" Taylor’s dum-as-they-cum secretary, Lucy Brown (SHARON KELLY), a.k.a. \"Juicy Lucy, the girl with secretarial secretions,\" is only too happy to fill her mouth with Rick’s private dick. As Rick says, \"A woman should be obscene and not heard.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some people will do anything for money...even if it kills them.","title":"Love Games","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
