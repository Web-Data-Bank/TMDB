Both of them are always arguing over their relationship. One day they went to a trip out of the city, into the outskirt. They hope they can solve their problems or at least escape them temporarily. They don’t have a solution, and they don’t understand why they are together. One thing that keeps them together is their love and care for each other. This is the second part of James Lee’s Love Trilogy which takes another look at unfaithfulness or rather faithlessness.","popularity":0.777,"poster_path":"/iMRuUdV8i6bYGLJBOgxdqlQSiW6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Da Huang Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2007-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things We Do When We Fall in Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
