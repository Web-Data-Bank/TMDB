As most of the inhabitants are illiterate, they have no choice but to ask for the help of Antônio Biá, a man who has been ostracized ever since it was discovered that he had sent out letters with lies about their reputations as a way to keep his job in Javé's seldom-used post office. He now has the task of documenting people's memories of how the city was founded, yet each inhabitant has his or her own version of what happened.","popularity":1.191,"poster_path":"/o8OcEbRZr0vWvDC4FW3p25T9Rj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bananeira Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":20973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laterit Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":4243,"logo_path":"/1HE2IvZ6DLRHHl7ZCk5tXzzj6jD.png","name":"Gullane Entretenimento","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Yoruba","iso_639_1":"yo","name":"Èdè Yorùbá"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Storytellers","video":false,"vote_average":7.417,"vote_count":18}
