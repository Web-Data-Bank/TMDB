The film focuses on the introduction of a massive museum of contemporary art in the same buildings that housed Sprague Electric Company in a typical New England mill town. Billed as an engine of economic development, the museum hasn't produced the jobs it promised and the city's downtown is semi-deserted. The film argues that national policy must change and that vibrant unions and social movements are needed to bring about a new 'New Deal' to deal with the social and economic crisis facing U.S. cities today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell to Factory Towns?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
