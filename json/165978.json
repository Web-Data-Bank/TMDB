The full film appears to be lost, but shortened versions, including one with dialogue scenes added in Germany in 1935, can be found on the internet. Additionally, Eisenstein's role in making the picture remains unclear: did he direct some or all of it, just edit it, or merely leave it to Alexandrov and Tisse to make? Released in the USA 1930 in a 65 minute (5800 ft.) version with English intertitles and a music track under the title BIRTH.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":483,"logo_path":"/mCEJD7utltKsFY1fPVM4uWQGmvz.png","name":"Praesens-Film AG","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1930-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Misery and Fortune of Woman","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
