Katy, the cook, buys Linda a dress and with the help of Linda's cousin, Marian, conspires to get Linda to the dance. When Linda's friend Suzy tells her that she was invited as a prank, however, she refuses to go to the dance. Without her glasses and wearing stylish clothes, Linda is quite attractive, but she still rejects all the invitations from the fraternity brothers.
