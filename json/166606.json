Building contractor Patrick is unaware that Helene, his wife for 15 years, intends to celebrate their wedding anniversary with a surprise party. She's invited friends and relatives to spend the weekend at their blue house. Elsewhere down the road, at an identical blue house, Patrick and his other love, Elizabeth, the mother of his two-year-old daughter, are planning an engagement party for the son of their neighbor. Neither woman knows about the other, and this sticky situation requires Patrick to rush back and forth from one blue house to another throughout the evening. The story is told in flashback by Patrick -- from his hospital bed.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/8s6v4rzPuH8nLBGnOIV4CEvmc6w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1382,"logo_path":"/sOg7LGESPH5vCTOIdbMhLuypoLL.png","name":"PolyGram Filmed Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ça reste entre nous","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":11}
