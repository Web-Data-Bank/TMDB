The incendiary, call-to-arms original was released in November of 1992 and the time to celebrate its power and legacy is now.  DVD #1 included in the Deluxe Box Set features Rage Against the Machine’s free concert in Finsbury Park on June 2010, which was a “thank you” to U.K. fans for making ‘Killing in the Name’ the U.K.’s No. 1 single during Christmas Week 2009. Also included are music videos plus live concert performance clips.  DVD #2 features Rage’s debut album, focusing on live performance from 1991-1994 and includes the full set of RATM’s first public performance as well as various live, rare clips.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xJoSP94AeGRxgHsXt3ZaFpRHkBi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"20th Anniversary Special Edition","title":"Rage Against The Machine - XX","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
