He wants to announce a change in his will. At the same time, a dangerous mental patient escapes from a nearby psychiatric ward. Higgins and Lane are put on his trail. But the arrest of the psychopath proves to be extremely difficult. Shortly thereafter, a mysterious hooded man is on the loose in the castle. He frightens Sir Wonderly so much that the old man suffers a shock and falls into a coma. But that's not all: the will suddenly disappears and two sons are murdered. Sir John personally intervenes to solve the case with Higgins and Lane.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ufBJZKYfaCEgvpIQyL45ZMgjpCL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42272,"logo_path":"/2bAuO4EvS59O1uXZQAKXG0HIXQg.png","name":"RTL","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":29165,"logo_path":"/d1wokdgTjC7lJs6yktVd61JZrwD.png","name":"Rialto Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edgar Wallace - Das Schloss des Grauens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
