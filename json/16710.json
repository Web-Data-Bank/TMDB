When she's laid off with no warning, she starts losing hope for the first time - until a letter arrives announcing the death of a father she's never met. Desperate for any kind of help, Brenda takes her family to Georgia for the funeral, but nothing could have prepared her for the Browns, her father's fun-loving, crass Southern clan. In a small-town world full of long afternoons and country fairs, Brenda struggles to get to know the family she never knew existed...and finds a brand new romance that just might change her life.","popularity":6.98,"poster_path":"/61qE0TunNdJiPELBdywMlpvZXDB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3096,"logo_path":"/fkZTZ4veYYr3lwr2riVrVAOfeqD.png","name":"Tyler Perry Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-03-21","revenue":41939392,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Check your baggage at the door.","title":"Meet the Browns","video":false,"vote_average":6.747,"vote_count":89}
