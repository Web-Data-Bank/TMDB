They are forced to beg on the streets by their koranic schoolteachers and suffer severe physical abuse and neglect. Following the staff of local grassroots NGO La Maison de la Gare (MDG) in their efforts to combat this, the documentary sets out on a poetic exploration of the nature and circumstances that breed and prolong the suffering of the children.","popularity":1.343,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talibe: The Least Favored Children of Senegal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
