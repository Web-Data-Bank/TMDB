Yao sells pirated DVDs in the street and wanders disconsolately around the barrio until he glimpses divorcee Maria Luisa working in her boutique. High-strung and irritable, Maria lives with her gay son, Rober, who, like many other things in life, is a disappointment to her. Rachid, meanwhile, is doing just fine working as a hairstylist in a beauty salon; Rober is hopelessly in love with him. When Yao starts sleeping in Rober's flat, a confrontation between him and Maria suddenly becomes inevitable, and when it comes, what could have been an embarrassment is actually handled with grace.","popularity":2.95,"poster_path":"/fmziG0ticKM2q33tKGR3dj27UKM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13572,"logo_path":null,"name":"DC Medias","origin_country":""},{"id":51162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sagrera Audiovisuals","origin_country":""},{"id":73108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metrojavier","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2010-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The God of Wood","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":2}
