Exotic coral reefs, vibrant sea walls in the sub-arctic pulsating with anemones and crustaceans: these biodiversity hot spots are as vital to our lives as the rainforests. Shot on location in Palau, Vancouver Island, French Polynesia, Mexico, and The Bahamas using groundbreaking 3D cinematography, The Last Reef takes us on a global journey to explore the connection of our cities on land with the ocean's complex, parallel world of the coral reefs beneath the sea.","popularity":2.627,"poster_path":"/aG6Om9oQ38OnVm8k7Suu6Dk3Mca.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yes/No Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":50255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liquid Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":5576,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giant Screen Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BS","name":"Bahamas"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"PF","name":"French Polynesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"PW","name":"Palau"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Reef: Cities Beneath the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":18}
