It follows the story of a migrant family from the demolition of their neighborhood to their on-going struggle for housing rights. The film takes a look at the city on a macro level and through the eyes of experts, going from the tops of mushrooming skyscrapers to the depths of the railway tunnel under the Bosphorous strait; from the historic neighborhoods in the south to the forests in the north; from isolated islands of poverty to the villas of the rich. It's an Istanbul going from 15 million to 30 million. It's an Istanbul going from 2 million cars to 8 million. It's the Istanbul of the future that will soon engulf the entire region. It's an Istanbul nobody has ever seen before.","popularity":0.936,"poster_path":"/9dbicT9xVs73XZbq7mFE1i9jX0N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11680,"logo_path":"/thDuwlPhKqGkfPzk0qd6zIiSw4m.png","name":"Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":13163,"logo_path":null,"name":"York Street Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ecumenopolis: City Without Limits","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":10}
