The storyline was based on the play Ezredforduló (Turn of the Millennium) by Miklós Boldizsár, who co-wrote the libretto.  The opera was first staged in 1983 on an open-air stage in Budapest. This first performance was also made into a 1984 film, directed by Gábor Koltay, and its music released on an album. The musical became a smash hit and is still very popular in Hungary and among Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries.","popularity":1.511,"poster_path":"/te2cpF0VyYgT4rmL3KGP4hfG1TF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mokép","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":8100,"logo_path":"/1HuVRo0SYPSzYvduxVf4baaWqOI.png","name":"Mafilm","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":76020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magyar Filmlaboratórium Vállalat","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1984-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stephen, the King","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":9}
