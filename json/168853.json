They developed their bikes through rigorous field-testing, often risking life and limb to do so. Some of these cyclists were Category-1 road racers looking for a new way to train during the off-season. Others were simply fun-loving hippies looking for a new way to commune with nature. Their early bikes were scavenged from dumpsters and junkyards. It was from these humble beginnings that a multi-billion dollar industry, a form of recreation for the masses, and an Olympic event, were born. These hefty steeds were affectionately known as Klunkerz.","popularity":0.738,"poster_path":"/folsdIpbJY3uOyPVD5cZ82LnDAV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the late 1960s through the 1970s a group of cyclists in Northern California's Marin County turned the bicycle world upside-down by taking their adventures off-road.","title":"Klunkerz","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
