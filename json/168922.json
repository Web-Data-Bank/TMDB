Thirteen years later, Giovanni and Costanza fall in love to the jealousy of her uncle, who shuts her in a convent, ordering Giovanni to be killed by Malacarne who has meanwhile become a bandit. Barely alive, Giovanni is taken away by Bourbon soldiers. After Garibaldi’s arrival in Sicily and its union with Italy, Costanza is freed from the convent and returns to San Germano. She is visited by Giovanni and although still loves him, rejects him since she wishes to become a nun. In the meantime, Giovanni kills Malacarne and takes his place. Costanza marries the rich Lo Turco and the next day departs for Naples, but during the journey the carriage is attacked by Giovanni’s band. Costanza flees with him and they leave for America.","popularity":3.118,"poster_path":"/kMxcFQsK409w4xxQhRrhLizm2DG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1242,"logo_path":"/qOvcm1WCLlAdNoQ1kCkk2J7bhWk.png","name":"Reteitalia","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":12756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Numero uno cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1994-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bandits: Love and Liberty","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":4}
