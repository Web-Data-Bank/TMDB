The sentence triggers a thought process in the author’s mind, Cosimo Terlizzi, leading him  to delve deep into himself.  His thoughts are registered as in a spontaneous diary made of a couple’s life, voyeurism,  constant geographical changes, multi media betrayals and book readings.  The collected traces take him to discover the lights and shadows of his personality. What  emerges is man’s dual nature, divided between instinct and morality.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buena Onda","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
