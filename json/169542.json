The filmmakers spent more than 20 years documenting the Soviet occupation, the exile of millions of refugees maimed by Soviet mines, a violent civil war, the fatal alliance of the Taliban with al-Qaeda, the invasion by United States forces and people still determined to survive to this day. Filmmakers Jim Burroughs and Suzanne Bauman have a wealth of footage from more than 20 years of following this story, as well as compelling footage from the 1950s and '60s showing life in Afghanistan before the war.","popularity":1.342,"poster_path":"/nY30HvPsNBQCHDuIO1J1xOtBJUI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow of Afghanistan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
