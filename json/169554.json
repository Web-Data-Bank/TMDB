Set against depressed but quintessentially American landscapes - the former revivalist district of upstate New York, old mining country in the mountains of northern California, and the stark badlands of South Dakota - the film interlaces three very intimate, apolitical portraits of young individuals trying to lead more extraordinary, mystical lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Mystic","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
