First, the film sets the context with the rise of Fascism. Then, in 1936, Spain's military revolts against the elected government, and the U.S. and Europe agree not to intervene. In response, volunteers snuck past border guards into Spain to fight with the Republicans. The men and women veterans describe the perils of reaching Spain, limited training, responsibilities of command thrust on the very young, deprivations of a soldier's life, lack of mat√©riel, horrible rates of casualties, and ultimate vindication at the end of World War II.","popularity":0.629,"poster_path":"/aHArsm3EHBgnqFbHsZL2ii2jOrV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Good Fight: The Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6}
