An old cop pities her and agrees to be her guarantor so that she could join a Nishijin weaver workshop. Yumi wishes to put her dark past behind her, but she's exposed by an ex-client. Despite the unwavered support of the old cop, she sees no way out and uses her seductive body again to get what she wants. Hiroyuki, her co-worker at the weaver workshop, is a pure-hearted young man who may redeem Yumi from her deadly path as a femme fatale.","popularity":1.68,"poster_path":"/7WFdddQrJbaglX9fdFWVD704wtv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9181,"logo_path":"/hObQEBMY8Es6ajSlVeBEIdqbuSK.png","name":"Art Theatre Guild","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1977-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Suicide at Nishijin","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
