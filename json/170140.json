Cliff has stated that Two A Penny, his most dramatically challenging movie role ever, is the film he is proudest of. He has stated, \"if I did want to send a fiolm as a CV, I would send that one\". It is certainly his most demanding and controversial role; cynical, self centered and highly manipulative, Jamie Hopkins lies, steals and double-crosses his mother (Dora Bryan), forces himself on his girlfriend (Ann Holloway) and gets involved in fist fights with criminals. Through the influence of his girlfriend, a born again Christian, is the possibility that he may reform, yet in the mystery of the film's by-line \"He promised to love her forever….today\" lies the possibility that he may well not.","popularity":0.877,"poster_path":"/v4NPt5T6R596XN3ev4y7Fe5sMkF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1967-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He promised to love her forever….today","title":"Two A Penny","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
