Seduced by the power of gangs, he joins for his own protection and a sense of identity. Nicky quickly becomes the most vicious and feared gang warlord of them all. But just as he reaches the height of his fame, his personal battles bring him to his knees.  The movie is based on the life story of Nicky Cruz who is legendary throughout the world for his compelling and honest message of life on the streets.
