The space in which the placenta is buried is called 'Zan Boko' - a phrase which connotes the religious, cultural and affective relations that bind the child to the land and that embraces the notions of 'rootedness' and 'belonging'. Kabor√© tells the story of Tinga, who resists the encroaching urbanization of his native territory. The specific rhythms and vision of the rural community, including its values, social relationship, and individual & collective destinies, are altered when a city is planted on the edge of an ancient native village.","popularity":1.092,"poster_path":"/v4HzGW9yNXOEgWtpbEDDRebjVGk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atria Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"release_date":"1988-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zan Boko","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7}
