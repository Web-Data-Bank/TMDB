But after a short but restful break in the journey Carl awakens to find himself tied and bound in an old roadside diner, his family trussed and gagged next to him, and a disparate group of dirty, disheveled, vagrant-like undesirables keeping them captive. Only time will reveal who they are and what they want, but things are not everything they might seem.","popularity":5.55,"poster_path":"/2mzBjQF5zUYwBBBozG7WHE5zvDr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whyte Booth Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":13324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oceanstorm Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Could you survive a breakdown?","title":"Dead End","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":14}
