The film begins at a city council meeting where an unidentified politician announces that the government has released $50,000 for the relief of unemployed plumbers. This prompts applause, but also a pointed question from an angry woman who wants to know what the government is going to do for the members of her profession: chorus girls. The politician glibly replies that the administration has set aside money—two million dollars, no less!—for the re-education of chorus girls, \"to fit them for the better things in life.\"","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/tFc0ltBKQ9xQyCOGwci9n2tOPQj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mixed Nuts","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2}
