That's just what she does after carefully leaving her wedding ring where her affluent husband, a lawyer, can see it. She has bought a farm, complete with a run-down farmhouse and a live-in cranky old man. Soon, because of the wonderful effects that her sympathy and her outsider's perspective have, her neighbors perceive great improvements in their lives. They attribute these changes to something miraculous (perhaps taking a cue from her name), and hordes of needy people descend on her farm.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/gIq0Bjl6kn0g9bmj0TyLAounELi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14423,"logo_path":null,"name":"SDICC","origin_country":""},{"id":14420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Carle-Lamy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1972-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The True Nature of Bernadette","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7}
