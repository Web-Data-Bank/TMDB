On her way to the Mandir, she assumes a singer, Puranchan, is teasing her and she slaps him, but ends up apologizing when she is told that he is blind. Guilt-ridden, she makes arrangements for him to be taken to Bombay, has his vision restored, and both fall in love with each other. Dinanath takes a liking to Puranchan and not only gets him a job but also wants him to wed Lali. About to inform his parents, Purchan does not know that Dinanath has actually instructed Lali not to see him anymore as he is a Harijan (Lower-Caste).","popularity":1.467,"poster_path":"/x39dEfX46IUgVflktBQNYZh39fr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1964-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A woman first insults a blind singer, then gets him cured, falls in love with him but ends up rejecting him","title":"Cha Cha Cha","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
