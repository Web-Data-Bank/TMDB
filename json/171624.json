Film historian and collector William K. Everson stated that the only surviving print was lost by actress Mary Duncan who had borrowed it from Fox Studios. In the December 1974 issue of \"Films in Review,\" he explained that Mary Duncan, one of the film's stars, wanted it to show to a group of friends in Florida. The star was aware that it was a dangerous nitrate print and assumed that Fox had others. She threw the only copy in the ocean, a mistake characterized by Everson as \"a monumental blunder to rank with Balaclava, Sarajevo, and the Fall of Babylon as one of history's blackest moments.\"","popularity":0.696,"poster_path":"/7G71ryJRJbu8bC6oixxzC87BMz0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A SWINGING CIRCUS TRAPEZE BECOMES THE PENDULUM OF PASSION!","title":"4 Devils","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
