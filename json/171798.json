As an undocumented worker, Dionicia takes pride in the fact that her kids can dream of a better life due to the risks and sacrifices she is willing to bear.  Director Sara MacPherson takes us behind the scenes of the world of undocumented workers in such an emotionally sensitive manner that we feel a part of Dionicia’s gamble. And when her clandestine existence starts to close in on her, there can be no doubt that Dionicia’s bet on herself is far more crucial than all the wagering done at the track.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dPIxYhuCX93T9cglj9WOTEdkNMk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stable Life","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
