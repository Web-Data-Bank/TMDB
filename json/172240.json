Trust in its green projects is almost limitless. Founded in 1961, it is the most influential lobby group for the environment in the world, thanks largely to its excellent contacts in both the political and industrial spheres. Behind the organisation’s eco-façade, the documentary maker uncovered explosive stories from all around the world.  A year in the making, this film is a journey into the heart of the green empire and may shatter public faith in the panda forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t7qZLMLZE8SB0bKniha6wzwLKrO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silence of the Pandas - What the WWF Isn’t Saying","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
