This 1942 Hungarian film takes a detailed and unflinching look at the hardships of mountain living, and the realistic approach proved influential to the Neorealist movement in Italian cinema. Hungarian master director Istvan Szots won the Biennale Cup at the Venice Film Festival for his auspicious debut, but the film was banned by the Nazis as \"too Catholic\" and not publicly exhibited until after World War II.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vHzmoT8uF21cron0S6ypsqwsPPK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hunnia Filmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1942-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People of the Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":11}
