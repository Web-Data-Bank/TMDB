The title refers to the expression \"gatlato al-rujula,\" or, roughly, \"machismo killed him\" and the film's mordant insights into male posturing and alienation in Algerian society animate this bit of folk wisdom. In mock documentary style, a young man recounts with wry commentary a typical day in his life in the Bab el-Oued quarter of Algiers, while the camera playfully shows a different story. In following Omar and his friends in their pursuit of happiness, the film examines with shrewd humor the gang values of urban youth; their passion for popular culture (soccer, \"Hindoo\" movies, Rai concerts), their hidden fear of women, and their social insecurity in an environment where they are marginalized.","popularity":0.904,"poster_path":"/rrmFeyhFFPDoikehUbe2PbbbIGZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1640,"logo_path":null,"name":"O.N.C.I.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1976-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Omar Gatlato","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8}
