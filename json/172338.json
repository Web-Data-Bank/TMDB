Both wickedly satirical and deeply affectionate, The Battle of Pussy Willow Creek tells the \"100% true\" story of how these oddball outsiders saved the Union from a nefarious foreign plot, how the forces of bigotry expunged their stunning victory from the history books, and - most importantly - how meeting one's ex on the field of battle can be just the thing to re-spark a detoured romance.","popularity":1.474,"poster_path":"/oxDap070qR9xfK9UikzKhKU3Qqz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let your freak flag fly.","title":"The Battle of Pussy Willow Creek","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
