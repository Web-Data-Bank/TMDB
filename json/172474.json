This experimental satire that examines what happens when a South Korean filmmaker sojourns into communist North Korea to breathe new life into that country's flagging, propaganda-driven movie industry. Believing that cinema can prop up North Korea's Juche Idea of self-reliance, mad dictator Kim Jong-Il pulls out all the stops to help the young émigré produce appropriate films.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Juche Idea","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
