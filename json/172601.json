Knight Center in Miami, Florida. There were 2400 people in attendance and the show drew a 4.8 rating on TBS.  Throughout the show, wrestlers were being interviewed as they arrived to the building, most notably, Lex Luger who was attacked by the Four Horsemen and was busted open after being slammed head first into the trunk of his limo. This was a big deal at the time as it was the first time Luger had bled while in the NWA. This would also be an important factor in the conclusion of Luger's match against Ric Flair at the 1988 Great American Bash PPV.","popularity":1.179,"poster_path":"/4BRUPp2GUsppKnLcMIV3BfbVmXj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7602,"logo_path":null,"name":"TBS Superstation","origin_country":""},{"id":13396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jim Crockett Promotions","origin_country":""},{"id":13397,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NWA Clash of The Champions II: Miami Mayhem","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
