However, if a special ceremony is not performed on the grounds, then the luck will only last for 24 years. A trio of Chinese Americans decide to venture into these mountains hoping to change their luck; Anna Wong (Moon Lee) is an executive facing a corporate meltdown, Wisely (Chin Ka-Lok) is dying of brain cancer, and UCLA Prof. Chang (Tsui Siu-Ming) is an expert in feng shui. Tin can potentate General Nguen (Yuen Wah) also has designs on the grounds -- hoping to turn his third world, fourth rate country into a superpower. Along the way, the three heroes fall in with a group of local rebels, including the high-kicking Nguen Van Vong (Sibelle Hu).","popularity":1.403,"poster_path":"/zAws8T2cCeAqevgzNDLpHWAXcV3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tsui Siu Ming Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bo Ho Films","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":81656,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Dawn Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1991-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bury Me High","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6}
