Mobilizing an astonishing range of media examples - from news anchors' idolatry of military machinery to the impact of government propaganda on war reporting - the film asks: How has war taken its place in the culture as an entertainment spectacle? And how does presenting war as entertainment affect the ability of citizens to evaluate the necessity and real human costs of military action?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Militainment, Inc.: Militarism & Pop Culture","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":2}
