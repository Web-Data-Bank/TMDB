Janek often stays at work after hours, just to avoid returning to the cramped apartment too early. One day, a man named Malinowski, who once lived in the same small room, visits the couple. He proposes to exchange their room for a new, two-room apartment that he has just received. Janek and Wanda are initially distrustful, but eventually, the exchange takes place. It turns out that Wanda's ex-husband, Jerzy, already lives in the new apartment. Despite the divorce, as he is registered with Wanda, he has the right to continue living in her apartment. Janek tries to find a way to get rid of the intruder.","popularity":1.474,"poster_path":"/dP70GPj6HjX6x4XOeQJL0G3Sakr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespół Filmowy \"Pryzmat\"","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1974-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Jungle Book of Regulations","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":26}
