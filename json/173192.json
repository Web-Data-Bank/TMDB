Locked away in Texas prisons for a quarter century, he has years to ponder questions of justice and innocence, truth and fate. Though he is virtually invisible to society, a team of dedicated attorneys spends years fighting for the right to test DNA evidence found at the murder scene. Their discoveries ultimately reveal that the price of a wrongful conviction goes well beyond one man’s loss of freedom.","popularity":0.63,"poster_path":"/tuuse3PuibyIwDUx6xeoZRa4GbZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Bandana Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Truth Matters.","title":"An Unreal Dream: The Michael Morton Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":8}
