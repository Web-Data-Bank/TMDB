The boys are boon companions, swiping money from their napping dad and heading for Ruby's store to buy lollies. They draw, collect cans, and watch the brother's pet lizard eat flies (occasionally giving it a snail). Adam's brother has a collection of cigarette butts, and he has a dream: to be an acrobat like their father was before his accident. Can dreams come true?","popularity":1.433,"poster_path":"/7anUf7sUL8jkT855Rt1o1NN98VQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2818,"logo_path":null,"name":"SBS Independent","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":94303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adam Benjamin Elliot Pty.
