While dividing the articles – from the apartment’s sale to splitting a toy tea set – the sisters compare options, destinies, lifestyles, expectations. The divergences are inevitable, because they’ve followed very different tracks. The turbulent sale of the apartment represents a turning point in their lives: they know they have never been so deeply involved as accomplices, or as sisters.","popularity":1.513,"poster_path":"/qu28PHmxT6TAr7770fTD0S4rpOZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11446,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lereby Produções","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2001-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inheritance","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":41}
