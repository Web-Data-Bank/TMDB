Shorty wants to do more than run a ranch, however -- he wants to prospect for gold, but he has no money. He recruits a pair of partners in the guise of two runaway vagrants and a pair of backers in two stranded singers. But then Rusty shows up, and his four somewhat bumbling hired hands manage to compound Larry and Curly's deep ineptitude, and Rusty wants them all out of his hair.","popularity":1.015,"poster_path":"/ym4WXjvRc2YB7C8BG2xCQV9njDt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"IT'S THE COMICAL...RHYTHMICAL...ACTION MUSICAL EVERYBODY'S HEADIN' FOR!","title":"Rockin' in the Rockies","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
