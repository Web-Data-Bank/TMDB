Among the highlights of the gig are a spunky rendition of Built For Comfort and the stirring, little-known composition Peace; its simplistic lyrics and heartfelt sentiments make it a bluesy first cousin to John Lennon's Give Peace A Chance. Interspersed with the great music are warm recollections from Dixon as he covers topics ranging from composing to his mid 1960s re-emergence in England via cover versions of his best material courtesy of The Rolling Stones and Cream (which featured long time admirer Eric Clapton).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":31580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Music Video Distributors","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"The blues are my heritage....and the blues are here to stay.\" - Willie Dixon","title":"Willie Dixon - I Am The Blues","video":true,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
