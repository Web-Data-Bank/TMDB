Harry Benham and Mignon Anderson were versatile and popular Thanhouser stars, here showing considerable skill in light comedy, a genre that invites plenty of satirical social observation such as the burgeoning beauty-salon industry here. Cinema technique shows much more intricate editing and freer use of closeups than just a year or two earlier.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b2FCnOeXURelowQ1PkIxOQEO1gE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madam Blanche, Beauty Doctor","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
