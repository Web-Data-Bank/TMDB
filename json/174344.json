Stricken with panic, he hides the body and takes to the deep wilderness in hopes of outrunning both the authorities and his own conscience. But as both begin to close in, Bruce falls apart mentally and morally and mysteries unravel to reveal who he was before the accident, the truth behind his victim, and the circumstances that brought them together in a single moment.","popularity":3.251,"poster_path":"/nmhIq98RurJvOUvmnzNa3l9LWf9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7029,"logo_path":"/i49Jb3md21vxSOY3bBXRvCRXYKX.png","name":"micro_scope","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whitewash","video":false,"vote_average":5.956,"vote_count":34}
