He is immediately spotted by a crook who dispatches a fetching lady to shake him down. At a restaurant, she gets him drunk and lays him out with knockout drops. But what's in the bag is not what she is expecting, and she flees. The now-drunken farmer has stepped dizzily outside to acquaint himself with a lamppost when another sharper steps up and hauls him into a crooked card game. While prospects do not look good for Farmer Al Falfa, he has more tricks up his sleeve than the city slickers realize.","popularity":0.912,"poster_path":"/lb6fqGfLwwfdCOUlL2vO3ZKZFvN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farmer Al Falfa Sees New York","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
