Happy speaks with someone in the park and takes a trip to the moon on a rocket that looks like the front half of a current racing car, where he is made king of the moon. A ballerina does a shimmy and Our Hero winds up back in the park being accosted by a cop. The inference is that he has fallen asleep and dreamed the entire trip.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vBmIY5MlFf1QPaG4hMbkhrqAUWl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Pan Film Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Trip to the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":10}
