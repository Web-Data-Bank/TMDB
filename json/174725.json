Starting in Cumberland, MD and going to Washington, DC, this short follows the man who pretty much just sees the various parts along the river. For a film from 1917, this isn't too impressive as the camera-work isn't anything special and you could say the story was very weak considering what other types of movies were being released at this time.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Down the old Potomac","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
