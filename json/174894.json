The story is a bunch of antics that go on in a diner/restaurant (they used to call a \"beanery\") and in the kitchen as Bobby and his dog help out. Some of the gags are excellent. The dog is a riot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rotiFj8wxIbeKNZrr4R2dkDMNxB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobby Bumps Puts a Beanery on the Bum","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
