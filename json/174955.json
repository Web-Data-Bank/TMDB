Meyer dresses up in what he considers Tyrolean attire. However, he mistakenly travels to the Bavarian Alps rather than Austria. Meyer becomes infatuated with Kitty, a young, attractive woman at the hotel where he is staying. His pursuit of her angers many of her other suitors who are also staying at the hotel. In order to impress Kitty, Meyer agrees rather reluctantly to climb Mount Watzmann. While they are approaching the summit, both Meyer's wife and Kitty's fiancee unexepectedly arrive from Berlin.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/3QCZ4Qwt2hckI6NuTtX2tiPP4CQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions-AG Union (PAGU)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1919-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meyer from Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":7}
