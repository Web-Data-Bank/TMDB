A house burns from the inside while its occupants focus on the emotional issues of their lives. The inhabitants serve life sentences with no remission in a structure of insecurity - while impending disaster is ignored. An absent minded couple sits calmly reading as fires erupt in their clothing, books and furniture. They nonchalantly swat at the flames with a stoic inattentiveness.  Burn embraces an anti-narrative structure yet intense drama is found in the work. Finally a decisive act is taken leading to the possibility of a miraculous event.","popularity":1.371,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burn","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
