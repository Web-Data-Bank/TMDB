While she's dead set against it, the niece is a sweet thing and would do anything to help her aunt--even marry the rich jerk. However, a possible way out is presented. When a poor young man is taken in and fed, he turns out (naturally) to be a jockey and thinks he can win the $3000 prize at the fair and save the farm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yAxRPlgGAvgNFcbw6CZr4dkhLEk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maurice Tourneur Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The County Fair","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6}
