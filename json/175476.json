The first half of this film is a blatant copy of \"Easy Street\". Pollard plays the local constable, charged with maintaining order in the tough slum district.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1921-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Ringside","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
