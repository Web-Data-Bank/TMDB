It stars Snub Pollard who is initially introduced as a baby left on a doorstep before we see him fully grown about 20 or so years later still in that basket! From there, he gets bumped car to car crossing the street prior to getting literally thrown through a window as an auction is taking place! Also appearing is James Finlayson as a man who's items accidentally get sold.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sold at Auction","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1}
