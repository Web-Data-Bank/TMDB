Semon plays his default character, a grotesque hard-working incompetent. (I'm going to be using the word 'grotesque' a lot in this particular review.) This time round, he blunders into a boutique. After causing some damage he can't pay for, Larry is put to work as a general dogsbody. Mayhem ensues.","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1923-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gown Shop","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
