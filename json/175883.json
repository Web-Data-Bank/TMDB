James Parrott, brother of Charley Chase, was an equally skilled man behind the camera, later writing and directing some of Roach's best two-reelers, before he died too young, but while the gags here are well done, he never really developed much of a personality in these pieces and they are not, somehow, quite as sharp as the stuff he was co-starring in with Sid Saylor two or three years before. The extended gag with the plank of wood seesawing is typical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1923-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paste and Paper","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
