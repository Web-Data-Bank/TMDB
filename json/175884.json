At first he thinks it's just a coincidence, as the beautiful young woman he's romancing is much younger than the woman who vanished, who would be in her late 50s or early 60s by now. Soon, however, he begins to believe that maybe it's not such a coincidence after all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zQPHyiVdTulprphpEhEK2nqaQph.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frank Lloyd Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Oxen","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":5}
