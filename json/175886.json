The hands sketch a small black dot and ink it in. Then the dot proceeds to bounce across the cartoonist's easel, until the hands finally catch it and unfold it into Ko-Ko the Clown.  There's a mouse in Max's studio, and Ko-Ko wants to catch him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":40656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Out of the Inkwell Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trapped","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
