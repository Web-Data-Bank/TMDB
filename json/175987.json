The West is dying. The American frontier is undergoing a violent transition from the ways of old to modern times, and Mexico has entered a prolonged period of bloody civil war. Reformed outlaw John Marston is on his way to capture former running buddy Bill Williamson when he comes upon a half dead snake oil merchant named West Dickens. Marston travels under a bleak and unforgiving sun, teaming up with a violent sheriff and a colorful mentally deranged grave robber and together they discover a bloody massacre of homesteaders left in the wake of Williamson. They hatch a plan to break into an abandoned fort where the Williamson Gang is holed up - and a dark, surprising twist ensues.","popularity":2.088,"poster_path":"/8sHDRXoMx285xsXLot9RMUl2Xas.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rockstar North","origin_country":""},{"id":120044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rockstar Games","origin_country":""},{"id":50011,"logo_path":"/tU8VfJGsFqLdqXEZAiasSvK4E1p.png","name":"Fox International Channels","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Dead Redemption: The Man from Blackwater","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":13}
