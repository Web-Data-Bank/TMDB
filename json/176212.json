In addition to establishing an omnipresent theme in Hong Kong cinema – the plight of the urban poor – the film is also a prime example of the popular melodramas of the time, which featured displaced Mainland film stars.","popularity":1.97,"poster_path":"/7bdMsNGdU1ZO8ySWoYnNyyjKneQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Union Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1953-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Face of Demolition","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
