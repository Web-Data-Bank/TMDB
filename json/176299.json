President Coolidge is presented as a simple man of the people who helps his cousin with the haying when he is in the neighborhood, works in the building he was born in and lives in the same house his father was born in: just another fellow like you and me. He runs the nation just about as well as we could.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bvSlsD8CLE6vtzeX6e0jgeD89Ef.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visitin' 'round at Coolidge Corners","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
