His only outlet from her and the increasing debt into which they are sinking, are the increasingly frequent quiet sessions at the local tavern. As an Oriental saying goes, 'Moments of crisis are moments of opportunities'. These appear during the celebration of the holiday of Ferragosto on 15 August. That's when everybody leaves town to have fun. Opportunity knocks on Gianni's door in the most unexpected way.","popularity":5.063,"poster_path":"/qqvur0NR5NcdOjRVvHBgpjXjubm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53334,"logo_path":"/nuY4cvsxmTTHrGATRil6uLLHry5.png","name":"Archimede","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2008-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mid-August Lunch","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":99}
