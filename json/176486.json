A film this dangerous hasn't been seen since Cannonball Run 2. Heath Kirchart and Jeremy Klein are two skateboarders just out to have a good time in a race across the good old US of A. Rescued after a near death skateboarding accident, the two show off their amazing ability to cause destruction while a sinister cop, with an agenda of his own, tires to bring them down. The top notch story, an all-star cast (Eric Estrada, Tony Hawk, Ming Tran), and a special guest appearance by the Hook-Ups Destruction Van, makes Destroying America this year's hottest movie.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destroying America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
