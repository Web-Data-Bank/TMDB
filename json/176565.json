When her filmmaker grandfather, Liu Chi-Sheng, lands in hospital, 18-year-old Jie has him recount the love story between him and her grandmother, Chiang Mei-Yue, that happened during a visit of the film sets of Beitou. Told in sweetly campy cinema flashbacks and semi-animated inserts, Forever Love is a love letter to Taiwanese cinema as much as it is a romance for the ages.","popularity":1.07,"poster_path":"/6ZZTtbltiqMvZD3PkPGw2zQ0oA8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2013-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forever Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.429,"vote_count":7}
