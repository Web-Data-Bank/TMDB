The story unravels quite well with good dialog and superior acting from the entire cast. The movie is philosophical without being bogged down by the some times heavy content. A very refreshing look at life, getting old, being free and always finding ways to share, appreciate and enjoy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/grprbpGasJnXgVPBRdG580V6s98.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ovídeo TV S.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":2562,"logo_path":"/hQcSVwfXKkjXzD4oO9BmHKoyfkh.png","name":"Patagonik","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2006-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remake","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
