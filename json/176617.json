When he is laid off by two schools in a row, the family runs into difficulties. The children resort to begging on the streets to pay the mother's medical bills. Turning to writing, Chan's novel fails to find a publisher and, worse still, he comes down with tuberculosis. Dealt a further blow by the death of the youngest daughter and the pressures from the loan sharks, Chan contemplates killing himself and his family but changes his mind when he witnesses the sacrifices made by other parents for their children. He vows to be a dutiful father and tries his best to overcome their adversities. His novel is finally published and sells well. Through thick and thin, the family at last sees the light at the end of the tunnel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s5t0bp4L00pGVK8NaPkITfpZLuZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shan Luen Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Devotion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
