His only company is Luisa, the cleaning lady, with whom he plays cat and mouse.  To escape the sleep of reason – which creates monsters -, Hugo exercises his lyrical vein by writing, with his friend Manuel, songs about their neighbourhood.  The quiet dilettantism of our protagonist is shaken by Catarina, a young and beautiful translator who’s starting her professional life as a freelancer.  Hugo is hooked and wavers. High above, a kestrel falcon hovers.  It’s not the only bird of prey that can do it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z0pWCUbR7hOkPbiGmPt2E6gcnuV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9020,"logo_path":"/qAcfiiC2WPGrfotZPnoHkDtQ6lr.png","name":"O Som e a Fúria","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2006-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bird of Prey","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
