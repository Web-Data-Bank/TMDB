When the two have their chance to take a ride in a posh car during a shooting, Jeanette slams on the throttle and the two friends take off.  Their aimless journey takes them to a fashionable winter sports’ hotel, where Jeanette reserves a name under “The Countess of Monte Christo”.  Everything’s going dandy; no one suspects a thing.
