When a body finally emerges on the lake and suspects literally crawl out of the hills, the two lawmen realize theyâ€™re being toyed with and to make things worse, the killer seems to have set his eyes on a group of sorority girls who are not only isolated by the lake, but have their own nefarious plans in mind. Outnumbered and out of options, the two lawmen must solve the mystery of the missing girls or suffer the same fate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1RVY4sGoo7TxFUjngply7PeMJAf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21678,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marquis Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This party is B.Y.O.B","title":"Sorority Party Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":30}
