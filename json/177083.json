Fortunately, her foster father, Reynald, is kind and gentle with the girl and patiently helps her break through her shell. Kayla, 12, is sent to a group home where she gets to know Morgane, a rebellious teenager who’s planning to run away. At about the same time, Manu is released from the system on the day she turns 18, but she finds it difficult to adjust to her solitary existence outside of the system. All four meet up at a reception honoring a foster family with whom they’ve all previously lived.","popularity":1.638,"poster_path":"/nTKXeBjC9yPcjtGunNAOpomQUoA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11578,"logo_path":"/us1W5CytIttX4F526bRJmrS36dJ.png","name":"Super Écran","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":57579,"logo_path":"/al14xBYjgUndQZP5voBlqylHae3.png","name":"Ici RDI","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catimini","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":8}
