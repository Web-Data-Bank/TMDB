Part I, \"The Ultimate Journey\", moves from fertilization to birth of the human child, with excursions into comparative embryology. \"The Unknown World\" explores fur beetles and book worms and viruses among others - you will not be able to look at a fur coat the same way again. And in \"The Photographer's Secrets\" the technical people who developed the instruments he used explain how the cinemagic is done - a kiss from the inside, an opera singer's vocal cords, a tractor as seen 'over the shoulder' of an emerging worm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sCgDGXWvLqdNDWwAqJXhaCjDGh4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Odyssey of Life","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2}
