For the film, Pitchfork.tv traveled to Los Angeles, London, and cities across the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Seattle, Olympia, Port Townsend) to discuss the making of the album with everyone from frontman Isaac Brock to Calvin Johnson and producer Phil Ek. We learned the album's story back to front, including the fact that halfway through its recording, Ek was called in to rerecord three songs from the original sessions.","popularity":1.572,"poster_path":"/gy8APYCTfGDuRRnlewskqNzfx7M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pitchfork.tv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modest Mouse: The Lonesome Crowded West","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
