During his sixty-year-plus career, Eisner introduced the now-traditional mode of comic book production; championed mature, sophisticated storytelling; was an early advocate for using the medium as a tool for education; pioneered the now-popular graphic novel, and served as inspiration for generations of artists. Without a doubt, Will Eisner was the godfather of the American comic book.","popularity":0.955,"poster_path":"/zRLXFgZ5GwMflKCApCcLsNI3B5x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Will Eisner: Portrait of a Sequential Artist","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
