She bears a striking resemblance to Herbert's dead wife. They get married, but their relationship seems doomed, until gradually each one manages to penetrate the mysterious world of the other, and they begin to realize that they are bound by a kind of spiritual relationship.

His hard exterior slowly beings to thaw, and he starts to show feelings and responses that soften Lea's initial hatred and fear of him, and which put their relationship in a more positive light.","popularity":2.218,"poster_path":"/cJJmVTLewtz6ZGWjMQXv8Hlb4cI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ivan Fila Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avista Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":75389,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barrandov Biografia","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1996-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenƒçina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lea","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7}
