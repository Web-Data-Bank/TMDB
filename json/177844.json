The film captures the last living witnesses of the 1913 tragedy, reconstructs Calumet's past from individual memories, family legends and songs, and traces the legacy of the tragedy to the present day, when the town --out of work, out of money, out of luck -- still struggles to come to terms with this painful episode from its past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xxiaGhIcNIPgatgLFlISEyxeMXU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1913 Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
