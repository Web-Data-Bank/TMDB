Α cinematic pastiche made of testaments on the Greek underground scene of the 60s and 70s, the psychedelic influence in the visual arts and the avant-garde fusion of beat and surrealism in poetry. It is a film about a group of Greek artists and publishers that remained sometimes unseen and sometimes underground, and their personal statement in their effort to change the world with the power of art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices from the Greek Underground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
