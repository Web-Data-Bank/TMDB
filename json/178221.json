His passion to bring the church closer to the common people sets him on a collision course with his new superior, Father Nostler. When Mohr organizes a church choir that includes outcasts from the local tavern and performs in German instead of Latin, Nostler threatens him with disciplinary action. Their relationship further deteriorates when Maria a regular tavern patron, surprisingly joins the performance of the all-male church choir. As Mohr's initial successes start to crumble and his efforts backfire on him, he loses all hope and faces a trial of faith. The night before Christmas, Mohr has to decide if he will accept defeat and leave Oberndorf or embrace the true significance of the Holy Night.","popularity":2.1,"poster_path":"/wNtV2kyJz1YTmmaQuQHFbeEXVOz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5226,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirror Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2013-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The powerful true story behind the most popular Christmas carol of all time","title":"Silent Night","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
