Naturally, the wives themselves do not pursue careers, they depend on their husbands’ money. This is why most of their thoughts revolve around the husband. And because the husband only appears as “the” man, there is no man in this film. All women fight for the same man. Those who have one, want to keep him no matter what. And those who do not have one yet only have one goal: To take away somebody else’s husband.","popularity":0.93,"poster_path":"/60EJdyogoP59rpya0yRdWcuQio0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women in New York","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
