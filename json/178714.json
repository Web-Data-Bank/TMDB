Men Wanted.\"","popularity":0.742,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope \u0026 Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1906-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The only complete moving picture production showing the fire in progress","title":"San Francisco: Aftermath of Earthquake","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":11}
