Standing alongside a tree-lined farmhouse, two children who are about ten and four years old toss grain to a flock of about 50 domesticated ducks. A woman watches them briefly and then moves on. The older girl has her grain in a bucket, the younger one's grain is in her apron. The children stay in one spot, as does the camera; it's the ducks that move around. Chickens are in the background; only one braves the ducks' territory.","popularity":1.546,"poster_path":"/jHXiJB2ZKzzGctAAsaZVsQRpQHi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumière","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1896-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lumière Film Catalogue no. 14","title":"Poultry-Yard","video":false,"vote_average":4.188,"vote_count":16}
