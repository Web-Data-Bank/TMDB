Her first experience with the real Spain comes when her Jewish godfathers cannot come to her confirmation. One of the godfathers, using a ring, poses an early challenge to her innocence that puts her in danger. He later returns, indirectly introducing her to a new boyfriend. If he is one of the symbols for Jewish life under Franco, or for a Judeo-Christian interaction, that interaction is complex. The young woman encounters different lovers as she grows into adulthood, but at the same time she is burdened with financially supporting her father and his own rather decadent lifestyle. Again, this difference in generations could be understood as a difference between the \"new\" and \"old\" Spain; it is up to the viewers to interpret the story elements as they decide.","popularity":1.348,"poster_path":"/4lnOV5D2va3v3Cahwxbyv37sC26.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arandano S.A.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1981-02-26","revenue":201986,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maravillas","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":7}
