A second horse-drawn truck joins the first, and they head down the street to a house fire. Inside a man sleeps, he awakes amidst flames and throws himself back on the bed. In comes a firefighter, hosing down the blaze. He carries out the victim, down a ladder to safety. Other firefighters enter the house to save belongings, and out comes one with a baby. The saved man rejoices, but it's not over yet.","popularity":1.389,"poster_path":"/u9VONkr7FFGPQO3FO7vRjKiO3Rv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Williamson Kinematograph Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1901-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fire!","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":31}
