MANY are surprised to discover that in Revelation 17, there is another mysterious character at the heart of prophecy; a woman who rides the beast.  TRADITION says this \"mystery\" woman is connected with the church of Rome.  But isn't such a view outdated?  After all, today's Vatican is eager to join hands with evangelicals and all religions worldwide.  BIBLICAL truth and global events present a well-defined portrait of the woman and her powerful place in the Antichrist's future empire.  MORE THAN TEN remarkable clues in Revelation 17 and 18 prove the woman's identity beyond any reasonable doubt.
