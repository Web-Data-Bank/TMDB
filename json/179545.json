Violence and corruption fill the earth. To punish this wickedness, God vows to send a cleansing flood. Only one man - Noah - and his family will be spared because they alone honor God's law. God commands him to build an ark and fill it with two of every animal. Once building is under way, Noah and his sons face scorn and sabotage from their sinful neighbors - but they persevere. Noah's faith is vindicated when the heavens erupt with a rainy torrent for 40 days. But God's test of Noah's courage and commitment is just beginning.","popularity":1.246,"poster_path":"/hpTronzZNxFt0jf1xYFd4n1Q0zk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1353,"logo_path":"/yXhCcOFK5Fy3ZBQwhBYx8Zu9ZIw.png","name":"Hanna-Barbera Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noah's Ark","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
