He meets a young boy, Laury and his mother, Sharon in the park and is quite taken with them. He gets a job-prospect letter, as a private tutor, and applies at once. His employer is Mr. Morley, a surly, sour, mean-tempered old man who informs John he is to act as a tutor for his grandson, who turns out to be Laury. Sharon, Morleys daughter had eloped against her father's wishes and was abandoned by her husband after Laury's birth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iS3rei1bvMyJ9YK04rxjz776rSV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invincible Pictures Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Love with Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
