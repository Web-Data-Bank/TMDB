Instead of stealing gold bars, the outlaws are stealing high grade ore, having it smelted, and then having it plated to look like lead. The Government sends agents Bret and Larry who arrive in Cripple Creek posing as Texas gunfighters. Bret finds the smelting operation and Larry learns of the payoff. But the crooked town Marshal is suspicious of the two men and the reply of his inquiry to Texas exposes them putting their lives in danger.","popularity":2.253,"poster_path":"/s0FrrRhbcVTVzi4hBEoYSHF9xR3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edward Small Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"For every man who struck gold - a hundred tried to take it away from him","title":"Cripple Creek","video":false,"vote_average":5.455,"vote_count":11}
