Were they “just following orders” as some later declared? Or, did they break under the pressure of a vicious war in which the line between enemy soldier and civilian had been intentionally blurred?  American Experience focuses on the 1968 My Lai massacre, its subsequent cover-up, and the heroic efforts of the soldiers who broke ranks to try to halt the atrocities, and then bring them to light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mCRGsxmwlJPHwrToKpUihXu312D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Lai","video":false,"vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":5}
