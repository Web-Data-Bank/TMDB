Jasmine Orosco and Paola Apanapal are Bridget and Sophia: gorgeous super models by day, brutal bounty hunters by night. Murder, intrigue and pillow fights await our beautiful leading ladies at every turn, as they match wits and martial arts with a coterie of madmen and women bent on world domination. Filmed somewhere in South America in 1966, and poorly translated and dubbed by Germans, this unintentionally funny James Bond meets Barbarella love child plumbs the seedy depths of the international fashion model/psycho-killer underworld with a boldness that only a gun to the head can provide.","popularity":2.586,"poster_path":"/mhDlDTHNbSEPX6n1KFVyIjS9uX8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scream of the Bikini","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
