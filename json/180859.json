Their relationship is hardly conventional: in fact, it is unconsummated. Dino gets out of it, gratifying himself with prostitutes and swingers. He reaches his nadir when he looks up Anna’s old boyfriends to ask about their sexual relations with her, and even begs them to take her back, as a way to end their relationship. Anna can’t find a way out herself; she can’t bring herself to end this one-of-a-kind, tormented love affair. In the end, Dino’s angst is what makes her feel loved, feel unique. No solution seems to be waiting in the wings.","popularity":2.947,"poster_path":"/mP3RsoM1JWX3xbbLTosDF8uPgTS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And They Call It Summer","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":17}
