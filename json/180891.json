A year ago, however, a suicide attempt by Atsumi left her in a coma. Through 'sensing', a type of neurosurgical procedure allowing contact with the intentional aspect of a comatose patient's mind, Koishi tries to find out why Atsumi tried to kill herself, and to bring her back to consciousness. He enters her subconscious, and is told to find a picture of a plesiosaur she drew when she was a child. It turns out that a childhood incident buried in their past will bring their minds together.","popularity":6.273,"poster_path":"/j0caz3LUT1jXh3mgL0QXDzDzeuP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1393,"logo_path":"/lUACMATs6jcscXIrzNCQzbvNVN5.png","name":"TBS","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":882,"logo_path":"/iDw9Xxok1d9WAM2zFicI8p3khTH.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":1778,"logo_path":"/b5rT6VbYza3LyfltCmz1OcqzWJM.png","name":"dentsu","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Twins Japan","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12384,"logo_path":"/qNooLje0YQh1y3y9LUM2Y5QCtiF.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":139462,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazon Japan","origin_country":""},{"id":139463,"logo_path":null,"name":"OORONG-SHA","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12385,"logo_path":null,"name":"RKB Mainichi Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":14602,"logo_path":"/t9eqx5QCHtu8LxxgYzivqrJAosp.png","name":"AMUSE","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":157807,"logo_path":"/tyrJOOVAUIxQEJzjP1PhP2H5zFi.png","name":"WOWOW","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":41861,"logo_path":"/iQ9Av0fDGKDUInp4I5czxhz5fVj.png","name":"GYAO","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":7093,"logo_path":"/noWiZlQLfjCyDAUJlA0miLClsHI.png","name":"Hokkaido Broadcasting Co.","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3031,"logo_path":"/2JcgVKZ1gEY5RsLJU1CGj1MaKFj.png","name":"The Asahi Shimbun","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I will do anything you say.
