The incendiary anti-Modernist Munnings, now regarded as one of Britain's most sought-after artists, is at the centre of the complex love triangle, involving aspiring artist Florence Carter-Wood and Gilbert Evans, the land agent in charge of the Lamorna Valley estate. True - and deeply moving - the story is played out against the timeless beauty of the Cornish coast, in the approaching shadow of The Great War.","popularity":8.568,"poster_path":"/gZmoi0jpdR6NxxRGcN61hE6zUUS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marwood Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":32202,"logo_path":null,"name":"Apart Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2451,"logo_path":"/mZJLUZ89qpPQn49UN60Do7LlYmj.png","name":"CrossDay Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A true tale of love, liberty and scandal amongst the Edwardian artists' colony in Cornwall","title":"Summer in February","video":false,"vote_average":5.452,"vote_count":104}
