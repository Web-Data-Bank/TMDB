Patricia passes it on to Charles and it spreads outwards from there, though a lot if this is implied. Gwenda Farnel is Jackie, Charles’ wife. She orders the butler to have sex with her when Charles is out with Patricia and then, to the butler’s relief, leaves her husband. Charles’ talking cock puts off one woman (unlisted blonde) whom he tries to chat up on a park bench, but amuses Danièle Troeger who seems to be an English tourist who asks him directions. Even a woman TV presenter seems to catch the affliction.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/yJLgYuZptWW1a0jmsCBQnGyJYq1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pussy Talk 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
