Surprisingly, they find that the sex trade there is stable and largely non-violent, and that the women who work on Davie Street meet daily to discuss safety and health issues and don't use pimps. The film also includes candid interviews with the prostitutes and footage of negotiations with potential clients.","popularity":0.74,"poster_path":"/xe830e6HYwwhgvmc3t0KjgpIhAs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14604,"logo_path":"/nayCQwYiu9QfYn1IprLuo48d8q5.png","name":"Spectrum Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A feature length documentary on street prostitution in Canada.","title":"Hookers on Davie","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
