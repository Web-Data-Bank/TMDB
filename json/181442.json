The pageantry of church ritual, the darkness of a brooding study with its hidden torture chamber and the false optimism of the light of a Roman dawn - all throw into relief the love of the beautiful diva Tosca, the idealism of her lover Cavaradossi and the deadly, destructive obsession of the malevolent Chief of Police, Scarpia. Drama, passion and fabulous music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vYspYnUY6ASNonEQUKtZPVoFnCt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":71722,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMI Classics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"2011 performance of Puccini's \"Tosca\" by the Royal Opera House","title":"Puccini: Tosca","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
