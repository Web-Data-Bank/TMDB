It presents, with some inevitable, tiny technical shortcomings, a live 1980 performance in Central Park, not the 1983 movie of the same name that also starred Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline. Those who remember that film, which had the benefit of retakes and editing, a lavish production budget, and the spaciousness of a Hollywood studio, may find this video less polished. On its own terms, it is nonetheless thoroughly enjoyable.","popularity":1.111,"poster_path":"/ieqoXDBIfXzFig1uqCZu9q4Y48F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73154,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Shakespeare Festival","origin_country":""},{"id":67119,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kultur Video","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broadway Theatre Archive","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A live 1980 performance in Central Park before the production moved to Broadway.","title":"The Pirates of Penzance","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5}
