The mayor from the town nearby commissions the building of a dam which would flood the valley and therefore submerge the village forever sealing the evil force under water after leader and his followers were incapacitated to be kept from escaping. However, fate ensured the leader's freedom as he remained in the depths when the waters covered Marienbad. Now 40 years later an array of disappearances and deaths in mysterious circumstances are threatening the town next to the reservoir that now covers Marienbad.","popularity":5.614,"poster_path":"/qPNI9lveU9S6ZlYfbDhCptD0ZoZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fantastic Factory (Filmax)","origin_country":""},{"id":9335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ España","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":9974,"logo_path":"/jd5x1rD18FAswqv1tRwPJCSbRGz.png","name":"ICAA","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beneath Still Waters","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":39}
