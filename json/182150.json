Filmed in his Montreal flat and inspired by The Tibetan Book of the Dead, it is a mysterious farewell letter in which we see him reading with a magnifying glass, obsessively pulling out books, objects, toys, cartologies. Lipsett dissects his isolation, reveals his secret world, shows the lair where he committed suicide on 1 May 1986, a few days before his 50th birthday.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strange Codes","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
