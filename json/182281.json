A large tabby cat sits perkily in front of the hospital. An old woman comes up to him and strokes him. A tall man calls out for him. A little girl lures him with a treat. The cat is present every day, quietly looking around. It’s hard to imagine the hospital without him. He is a subject of conversation, makes people smile and offers consolation. “He’s a bit of a mascot for me,” says one woman as she lights her cigarette. “If he is there, I’m fine.” What the Cat Sees is a portrait of the patients of the hospital, who pass by this special cat every day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What The Cat Sees","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
