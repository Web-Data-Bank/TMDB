He gives no explanation of his absence and his family asks no questions. It is only through the questions that a young writer named Asakura, who is secretly in love with Hisako, poses of local shop owners, that we learn that Hamanaka's disappearance may be related to the fact that the woman everyone thought he would marry, Tami  - who runs the cafe across the street from the Hamanaka electric store - had ended up tying the knot with another man who died soon thereafter.","popularity":1.081,"poster_path":"/yt7niiq6vbU8RhSiHX2v8WECJv4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9177,"logo_path":"/4J38yaZJMtU8fI1bxIdE9PHnGb7.png","name":"Eisei Gekijo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":1516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kindai Eiga Kyokai","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
