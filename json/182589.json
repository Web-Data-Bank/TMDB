The Bolshoi’s sumptuous staging with its luxurious sets and costumes gives life to Perrault’s fairy tale unlike any other. This performance of Sleeping Beauty was filmed as a sort of celebration of the grand reopening of the Bolshoi Theater's Main Stage (it had been closed for several years for a refurbishment).","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/2Uy1HmXeq9GgsHr5kyl7Gw19U5H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bolshoi Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2011-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bolshoi Ballet: The Sleeping Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
