Jota (Eduardo Frazão) stands out from this group, unclassifiable; his destiny has no straight lines save those on the asphalt.\r Jota lives in permanent conflict with everything and everybody in his small town. No room for stillness. And then comes Margarida (Ana Moreira). Jota has no inside, Margarida has no outside. In spite of, or because of, that, they meet. What can they do? They can just ride, they can get away with it even if its all messed up. Love is to be lived.","popularity":1.082,"poster_path":"/ukgG08iaFMYP8jWxLyEXB6JNkTn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3289,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clap Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2007-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Capacete Dourado","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
