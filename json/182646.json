Together with his father, an elderly fisherman from the Southern Ukraine, we follow the trail of his captors. Traveling from the calm Azov coastline to industrial conglomerates, from the furious mining region to the sleepless capital, we try to find the witnesses of the young soldier's final hours, as well as those who could have seen his body. The film uses a wide range of video and audio material including news, voice recordings and interviews. Its complex narrative construction shows the long and winding path of a father who seeks justice for his son's murderers.","popularity":0.86,"poster_path":"/gyY4XsINpC1LoSqUbWwdcH86wyI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142305,"logo_path":"/kwpAazO9RbKTIPW7UEBbeQEphUA.png","name":"DGTL RLGN","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
