Every day looks the same, every activity is predictable. Even the people‘s complaints are part of the daily routine. One of the residents hopes in vain that a lottery ticket will bring him refuge. For six days, filmmakers Andreea Paduraru and Cristi Puiu try to get through to these people, who are carrying their  whole past on their backs. To the question what the best days of their lives was, nobody can or wants to give an answer. Nearly everyone immediately starts about the day-to-day worries and problems in the home. Finally, one woman tells about her activities as head of the research department of the government of Ceausescu, with whom she once had an argument. Another resident recalls his time as a soldier in World War II and proceeds to the order of the day.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/d84y4tdkKwHplpNkSvrJ5JCL7ol.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandragora Film (RO)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1998-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"July 13 - July   19, 1998 Craiova, The Retirement Home","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
