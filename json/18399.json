Normally this procedure has only a 60% success rate, but \"Team Batista\" has achieved a run of 26 straight successes....when suddenly 3 patients in a row die on the operating table. Very disturbed, the lead surgeon requests an independent investigation. The hospital turns to Dr. Taguchi who is a specialist in psychosomatic disorders who is shocked to at the assignment because she knows nothing in particular about surgery. Assured, however, that this very lack of insider specialized knowledge is in fact the \"objectivity\" required, she diligently begins to investigate in her own polite, but persistent manner.","popularity":1.353,"poster_path":"/sAz0oeMFeocP4Jg1XkP3pacufaF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Glorious Team Batista","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
