Mickey's got big plans for expansion when surveyors show up to begin work on a factory. The gang travels by donkey cart to the office of Henry Mills, President of Pan American Export Company, to protest. Henry, in his 60s, is still a boy at heart: he has his chauffeur stop the car so he can join a sandlot game. He bails on a meeting with his board of directors, going with the kids to the factory site where he stops the workers and helps our gang add more rides. The directors follow him, and they get put to work. Will they ever have their meeting?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7QTqbn7ryPcc0IdSqVJUsqaOPyn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boys Will Be Joys","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
