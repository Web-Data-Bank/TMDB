A quartet sings \"Go Into Your Dance\" in honor of its originator, Al Jolson. They introduce the conductor, who is a pig caricature of orchestra leader Paul Whiteman. One of the musicians plugs the pig's tail into a light socket so he conducts at super speed. Then Captain Benny announces the start of the amateur hour, with an operatic cow and a tough guy reciting poetry with sound effects.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jYuujh2mL5c2edYY5CMBwxDa09E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
