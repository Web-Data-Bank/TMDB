A couple of gags that may have been created by Avery include: Oswald asking a lady to take off her hat as it's blocking his view but getting even more blocked when her hair suddenly grows into a giant afro! Also, as the trapeze artist spins around on his swing, so too do the audiences' heads from top to bottom! That's all the inventive stuff I saw in this cartoon, still Towne Hall Follies is worth a look for any Avery fans out there.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uzxOuk6C6UJfOsn50Fmwk0n0Mcq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Towne Hall Follies","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
