Offering fans a rare and close up look at the prodigious musicianship for which the band is renown, cameras follow the band closely, capturing not only their playing but also the intimacy they share on stage. The diverse track list includes many new songs from Snakes & Arrows as well as old favorites like 'Tom Sawyer' and 'Freewill' plus an explosive rendition of 'Between the Wheels.' Among the hidden gems and numerous special tour moments included as extras is the fan coveted \"What's That Smell\" vignette and outtakes, a skit used to intro the second set, which capitalizes on the still emerging comedic talents of both Alex and Geddy who excel (and revel) in their roles as wild characters.","popularity":1.406,"poster_path":"/mfOaXkujxHaRT7fFPQf8yUR89D2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":221,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rush: Snakes & Arrows Live","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8}
