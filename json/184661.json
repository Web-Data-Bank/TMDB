The teacher leaves the room, putting a turtle in charge. While she's gone, things go fine for a while, but the ape starts an all-out book tossing brawl. As the teacher returns, everyone suddenly stops, and although the room is a shambles, she congratulates them on behaving and dismisses them for the day.","popularity":0.948,"poster_path":"/lVgVi86TBvYQ6R80wZQkPqmUSGt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Elephant Never Forgets","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
