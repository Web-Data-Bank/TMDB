Amos Gitai returns to the house in West Jerusalem he profiled in 1980. He interviews members of the Jewish families who live there, and he talks with the Arab family who lived in the house until 1948. They are now in East Jerusalem and pay a nearly furtive visit to the street in front of their old house. Gitai also interviews Palestinian laborers at work on renovations and excavating an old tunnel to the Holy Mount. What do people think of each other, what do they think of Israel, what do they think of co-existence? Do the current residents know the house's history?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/73NhJzx4eVXGwPGribhHmRcZOQL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A House in Jerusalem","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
