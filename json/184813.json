He then meets fellow elite runner Kakeru who also left running, but caused by a dispute. Their meeting inspires both young men to run again, with Haiji choosing the fabled \"Hakone Ekiden\" (long distance relay race). The race requires a 10 member team so Haiji and Kakeru recruits 8 others (some of whom have never even run before). Within this unlikely group of runners a bond is formed through their training and a belief that they can accomplish the impossible.","popularity":1.458,"poster_path":"/17YlZvwFMY4CwYGDrIuLAsP1Eo7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feel the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":7}
