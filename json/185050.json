A monk, returning from Holy Land, joins the crusade and hears the children's confessions, gradually realizing that most of them are taking part not for religious, but for more worldly reasons, like rejected love and hopes for freedom, the true nature of their enthusiasm is homosexual.  In fact, if the children follow Jacques, it is more for romantic than religious reasons. They take literally the famous phrase: “Love one another”.","popularity":2.353,"poster_path":"/hJzw5CZlYT7aCpDUvtjAanDWjoV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avala Film","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":93389,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poste Parisien","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1968-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gates to Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9}
