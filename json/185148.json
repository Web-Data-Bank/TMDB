Two schools of the miniature paintings, done by anonymous artists, flourished after Akbar established unity and peace across what had been many smaller states: the Moghul (Islamic) school and the Rajput (Hindu) school. The Moghul paintings record the events of the court, while the Rajput school connects physical beauty and, in particular, the longing of women to the transcendent values of the spirit.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/oAbusrsy2nv3SMm7wM65xeJColL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2370,"logo_path":null,"name":"Merchant Ivory Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sword and the Flute","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
