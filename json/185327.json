Szlingerbaum felt that the only way he could relate the story of his family’s search for refuge after World War II was in Yiddish. This Belgian-based filmmaker, deeply impacted by New York experimental cinema, gives us a masterful blend of powerful drama and stark documentary to tell the story of postwar European Jewry. Home, as it had been, no longer exists, and all that Samy’s family wants is a place in which to sink new roots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zpBOhAm1DtTEwWr88207NHwJGEU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brussels-Transit","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
