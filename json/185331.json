Mili and Noam are high-school students who intend to celebrate their six-month anniversary by losing their virginity. What begins as an innocent pedal boat ride full of raging hormones, becomes a struggle against monstrous cats out for blood. This self-parodying low, low budget, independently produced feature is filled with surprises as well as hilarious oddball charm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7hvyD3oH6QDXRla00H0S1DwRXxg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16,"logo_path":"/7690NQfOfnbvrY3vFgyMO2Pc8WS.png","name":"United King Films","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2011-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The funniest Israeli film in years!","title":"Cats on a Pedal Boat","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
