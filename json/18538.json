Carmen, a beautiful Spanish woman with a tendency to lose her temper at the drop of a hat, is about to be married to Barnaby, a caring, wealthy, but slightly boring Englishman. While out with friends on her 'hen night' she encounters a stranger who suddenly sparks a passion that has been sleeping within her. As her wedding date approaches, she finds herself struggling to put this newcomer out of her mind, but his effect on her keeps growing stronger. What is it that he sees in her, and why does she feel like she's being pushed inevitably into his arms?","popularity":6.352,"poster_path":"/1Ndh5G2xemRDwJ2Qgo8dWNPzb28.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3502,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alquimia Cinema","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":3503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arcane Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Danger is in the details","title":"Dot the I","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":103}
