As he absorbs it all, these seemingly unrelated elements enter his apartment in the form of photographs that line his walls. Reminiscent of the work of Chris Marker, Barak’s Hunting Time is a poetic and moving meditation on memories and remembrance, history and documentation, reality and imagination.","popularity":2.105,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunting Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
