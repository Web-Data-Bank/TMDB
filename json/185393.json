The Jewish population in Greece went from 70,000 prior to the Holocaust, to 5,000 today. During several visits to Greece and through interviews with Jewish leaders, Holocaust survivors and academics, Gedeon exposes the misinformed and intolerant views propagated by Greek mass media, church sermons and the general public.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Presence of My Neighbours","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
