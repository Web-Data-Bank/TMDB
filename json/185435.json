With some needed twists that lend a feel-good touch, apart from a love triangle, the movie makes a bid to impress the audience. Director Sreenu, who has had some directorial experience before, takes the credit for shaping the story in such a way that it looks different. The film can be termed musical, for it deals with lots of inter-college music competitions. -- Jeevi @ Idlebrain.com","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hdb13Gqng2fRFXR5xIj2ONnl4sW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Janaki Weds Sriram","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
