A fan becomes a parasol, lanterns appear and disappear. The conjurer spins the open parasol in front of himself, and a dog leaps out from behind it. The dog becomes a woman, then a masked man appears. The conjurer sits them each on a box a few feet apart: suddenly the woman and man have changed places. The disappearing and the transfers continue in front of a simple backdrop.","popularity":0.943,"poster_path":"/aJ3ZrZ51GV0cOFelrrjjkuSBDn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1904-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tchin-Chao, the Chinese Conjurer","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":24}
