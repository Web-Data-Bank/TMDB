Now six of them remember the untold story of the first 17 days - when no-one outside knew if they were alive.  Filming down a Chilean mine, the program explores the nightmare of living in the dark tunnels half a mile underground, eating a spoonful of tuna every two days and not knowing if you would ever be found.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1eBCFHEFOedzOOaJ1Kr1AHrNjnV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chilean Miners: 17 Days Buried Alive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
