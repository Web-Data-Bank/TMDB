His influence spread to an entire generation of blues-tinged rockers, including The Rolling Stones and The Doors. Hooker's music is a lesson in deep blues, and here he revisits some of his most familiar material, including \"Boom Boom\" and his biggest hit, \"I'm in the Mood.\" Filled with frisky, guitar-driven boogies and heartsick ballads, this is the blues at its very best! Songs: It Serves Me Right to Suffer, One Bourbon One Scotch One Beer, I'll Never Get Out of These Blues Alive, Roll Me Like You Roll a Wagon Wheel, Boom Boom, I'm in the Mood, Look at What You Did to My Life, Chicken and Gravy, We're Gonna Do the Shout.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AoKdAy9Hszu3F1bMa3ZmEda03EQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Lee Hooker - Live In Montreal","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
