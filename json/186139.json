Aside from usual highlights such as Pyongyang or Arirang, this unique one-man documentary brings you to areas such as Chongjin or Wonson, still virtually unknown to even google or wikipedia. There, I attempt to pierce through the ever-present 'national mythology' and as much as possible, I try to connect with people - such as the waitress mesmerized by tablet computers, or a tour guide cautiously fascinated by modern pop culture.","popularity":1.024,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"North Korea lies somewhere between a 1930′s Soviet Union frozen in time and a dark, futuristic vision of society… as imagined back in the 70′s.","title":"DPRK: The Land Of Whispers","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
