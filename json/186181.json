He brought us free Shakespeare in the Park, Hair and A Chorus Line, and nurtured many of America’s greatest playwrights, directors and actors. His complex personality and mercurial behavior are much in evidence and spoken of with frankness through interviews with some of America’s most celebrated artists, including Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Kevin Kline, and James Earl Jones.","popularity":2.178,"poster_path":"/tNDp1DZmYNTsvVvy2X9XFreTT6i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174301,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Papp Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe Papp in Five Acts","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
