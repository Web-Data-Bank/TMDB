The title of this film comes from her remarkable 700-page painted life story in which she asks, “Where does life stop and art begin?” Director Franz Weisz masterfully weaves together interviews with people who knew her, family photographs, excerpts from a 1980 biopic, images of Charlotte’s vibrant paintings and a previously-unknown letter containing a shocking revelation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life? or Theatre?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
