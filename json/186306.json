Carel, a porn actress, and Ferd, a drug addict, invite the camera to participate in their wedding, their sex life, and their break-up. Produced before the landmark PBS documentary An American Family introduced television audiences to the live-in camera — and many decades before the ubiquity of reality television — this document raises questions about the relationship between subject and camera, privacy and manipulation. Originally presented as an installation, this one-hour version, which includes interviews with Carel, Ferd and Ginsberg, was distilled from thirty hours of footage recorded from 1970 to 1975. - Electronic Arts Intermix","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/rkt3lkmhrg2ISfw0YL5IwBbAcUU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video Data Bank","origin_country":""},{"id":20988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Arts Intermix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":6}
