Channeling is a practice dating back to antiquity wherein an individual, usually in a trance state, makes a psychic connection with a nonphysical being. The individual making the connection, known as the channeler, is then able to act as a dimensional go-between in bringing other humans in contact with the entity, as well as interpreting messages from the entity.","popularity":1.314,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14081,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mouska Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Spirit Channelers In America","title":"Tuning In","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
