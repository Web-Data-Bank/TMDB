A skunk tries to buy a ticket, costing a nickel, but he only has one scent. He looks for a way to sneak in. Meanwhile, Porky introduces the show: a collection of cartoons, drawn as stick figures. At the end, the audience is all gone because the skunk managed to sneak in. Porky's cartoons include: Circus Parade, Choo-Choo Train, Soldiers (Marchin), Horse Race, and Dances (hula, Mexican hat, and ballet). All accompanied by a self-parody musical score.","popularity":0.797,"poster_path":"/u4TcggtIcA5o0V8D9nTlRDOoX2g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porky's Preview","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":13}
