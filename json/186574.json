But as her 50th birthday draws near, she returns to the town she left in search of the love of her life, the aging porn director John Welles. Unfortunately, one of her travelling companions and former co-star takes a shine to one of their midnight snacks, a pizza delivery boy, and she creates a new vampire with a taste for bloody revenge!  As the four ex-porn stars ravage the town as part of their nightly fun, the pizza boy hooks up with the beleaguered mayor and the Moral Majority to stomp out the dangerously porn star-vampire menace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Death Never Looked This Good","title":"Pretty Dead Things","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
