Then, one day, Enrico meets Andrea, a 7 year old child, and falls in love with him. He wants to be Andrea’s good father, the good father he himself never had. But his emotional delirium isn’t able to hold back his animal instinct. By pure ‘chance’, the detectives find the monster in the act of his last execution.
