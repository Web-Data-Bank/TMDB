Derek Yee is Cheng, a brusque construction worker who discovers a magical umbrella on a routine dig. When the umbrella is opened and sprinkled with water, a 200 year-old genie arrives to grant the owner's wishes. As if that weren't enough, this genie happens to look like Cherie Chung! Cheng has been given a virtual ticket to Heaven, but he's more annoyed than grateful, and uses the Genie to perform mostly menial tasks.","popularity":0.739,"poster_path":"/c7v22hvvwjyoPm7A5kprA7b0ttX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1984-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wo ai shen xian zhe","title":"My Darling Genie","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
