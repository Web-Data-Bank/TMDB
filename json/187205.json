The event was filmed by an EMI film crew for a DVD release, Demon Days Live, in late March 2006. It was later announced that an American version of the event would take place from April 2 to April 6, 2006 at the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem. Within an hour of release tickets were sold out.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/kPOSkrvbzrLV7mwYo0PMN6iF1SZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gorillaz - Live in Harlem","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
