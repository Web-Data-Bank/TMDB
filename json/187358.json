A car load of girls meets a car load of boys and Ching and Paul ultimately fall in love. Yet the film takes an acrid twist and turns out to be more like a Shakespearian tragedy than a beach-babe party.","popularity":0.726,"poster_path":"/9Rb9sGp8E6fTg9Te5ov1J64INsU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1971-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunset","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
