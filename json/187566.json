They agree with one stipulation: If they write the movie, he has to make it.  It's a comedy, a love story, a psycho-sexual thriller, and a supernatural adventure all in one. Meanwhile, documentary footage of the writing process provides an inside look into the often-hilarious creative process, as well as the group dynamics that make collaboration between friends difficult.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A new comedy/drama/documentary/thriller/action movie/buddy picture/heist flick","title":"The Exquisite Corpse Project","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":6}
