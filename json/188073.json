A retired Marine Colonel reaches out to five men, a new generation returning from the battlefield. He brings them to the river. He puts a fly rod into their hand, teaches them to cast, and shares his secret: there are places where you can still be consumed by a simple act, find joy in a fight, and be redeemed as you gently release another creature, unharmed, into quiet waters.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Yet Begun to Fight","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
