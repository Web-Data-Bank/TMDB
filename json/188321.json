The result is a philosophical, often humorous rumination on the desire and labor that inform the conceptual and image making process of the cinema.","popularity":1.23,"poster_path":"/l1K6vRTgirdcGz8oQL1amYxTBUJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22811,"logo_path":null,"name":"JLG Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":172751,"logo_path":null,"name":"Télévision Suisse-Romande (TSR)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scénario du film Passion","video":false,"vote_average":5.556,"vote_count":9}
