During the Nazi siege of Moscow, a fearless 18-year-old girl named Zoya risked her life as a partisan fighter. Captured by the Germans, Zoya endured unspeakable tortures at the hands of the Gestapo but still refused to betray her comrades. Even on the gallows, Zoya defiantly spoke out against the Nazis and everything they stood for. In a series of flashbacks, this film re-creates not merely Zoya's death, but also her life.","popularity":1.084,"poster_path":"/e1WQDOSeSU4rz7O7XE32qztD3TL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15444,"logo_path":"/pdfT1FpxrxjsWnVEJ88XpyBmc1I.png","name":"Soyuzdetfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1944-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zoya","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
