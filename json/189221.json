At the beginning, we think that we are not going to stay. But we change only our post, department. We want a normal life. A house was bought, children were born. We obtine, we lean. We have pain in the daytime, we have pain at night, we have pain all the time. We hold on all the same, until the day when we do not hold on any more. The joints break, nerves also.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":"/8hz0mftMzzMo6OlwPEole46KDzT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76968,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ad Libitum","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entrée du personnel","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2}
