He had been working with the FBI and was about to publish a book critical of Dominican strongman, Trujillo. In 1988, a graduate student, Muriel Colber, wants to make Galíndez the subject of her dissertation. She's in Spain doing research; finding little, she goes to Santo Domingo. At every turn, the CIA, in the person of agent Robards, tries to thwart her; and, at each turn, as she considers abandoning the project, someone offers new information, often contradictory. She wants the truth behind the Galíndez mystery; will she find it?","popularity":2.569,"poster_path":"/1ycqWF1XkgonCjz972B0t4xwzmY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AI","name":"Anguilla"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Galíndez File","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":8}
