Una pasión surrealista","overview":"\"Óscar. The Color of Destiny\" is a revealing portrayal of a forgotten icon of French Surrealism: Spanish painter Óscar Domínguez, contemporary of Picasso. The film rediscovers the life of a talented artist who was ignored after he committed suicide, fifty years ago, victim of a serious illness which had disfigured his body: the Elephant Man's disease. The film is stirring and touching and compels admiration for the bohemian painter whose fate was self-destruction, after a wild crazy life. Lucas Fernández turns the life of a debauchee, who regarded himself a monster because of his disfiguring disease, into a universal story where art is the product of love and loneliness, of sex and violence before, during and after the Nazi invasion of Paris.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oscar.
