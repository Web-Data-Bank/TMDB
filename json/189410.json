Besides Atwill, six other controversial Bible scholars weigh in, showing that the teachings of Christ came from the ancient pagan mystery schools, and that Christianity was used as a political tool to control the masses of the day and is still being used this way today.","popularity":0.61,"poster_path":"/8IKdUcTINFtIZbpF5Bsii1imIRT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caesar's Messiah: The Roman Conspiracy to Invent Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":5}
