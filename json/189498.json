The movie follows several teams to the world's first zero-emissions grand prix on the Isle of Man – the most demanding and deadly circuit on the planet – in 2009 and on their return in 2010, 2011, and 2012.  For the visionaries, it's history. For the petrol-heads it's blasphemy. What's racing without the sound and fury of internal combustion engines? CHARGE is about the future. It's about change. It's about the dream of a clean, green world. It's about the dream of winning.","popularity":1.208,"poster_path":"/6ubEhBvsdDr8wWIYrzoqI23kFhy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charge Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
