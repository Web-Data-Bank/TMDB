And she quickly hooks up with a male partner in crime, in this case a Gentleman Crook played by perpetually grinning Creighton Hale. Mabel seems a little livelier in this film than in some of her other late works. In the very first scene we find her hitch-hiking, and she's forced to make a mad dash for cover when Hale's car nearly hits her. Soon they team up and crash a swanky party in a mansion to steal a jewel from the host's safe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p5fH61sX6HgwCRP28RRSEUyPbMM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Should Men Walk Home?","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
