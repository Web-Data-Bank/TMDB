It starts off with a terrific routine with an erratic elevator. Lane's character, Johnny Jones, upon sight falls in love with Mary Craig (played by Kathryn McGuire who appears in a number of Lane comedies). The man who hopes to marry her is Henry Sharp played by Wallace Lupino; the title card introducing this character says\" Henry Sharp â€“ so mean he would steal a dead fly from a blind spider.\" Johnny agrees to do his father a favor by posing as his little boy of about 10 years old. The father had told the wealthy widow he hopes to marry that he was only 30 years old. Because of Lane's small stature this is more believable than most comedy routines that have an adult playing a child.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dnzl2jNNvf9dFa8EovEPbYBTrjO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naughty Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
