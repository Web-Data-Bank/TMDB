When the black girl who \"jes' growed\" is auctioned as a slave but nobody will bid on her, Little Eva purchases Topsy for a nickel. That's the one part of this movie that I found plausible: slaveholders often refused to buy children, since their upkeep in food usually exceeded any labour they performed. There's a gooey romantic subplot between Mariette (the niece of Simon Legree) and George Shelby, son of a prominent slaveholder.","popularity":0.827,"poster_path":"/pWVzrSt4LGRQldrlEGrTfXru5MC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feature Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS ROARED at their antics on the stage -- MILLIONS will enjoy the laugh of their lives when they see the INTERNATIONALLY FAMOUS -- DUNCAN SISTERS IN THE MOTION PICTURE 'TOPSY and EVA'","title":"Topsy and Eva","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
