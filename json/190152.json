Entitled The Open Road, his remarkable travelogue was conceived as a series of shorts, 26 episodes in all, to be shown weekly at the cinema.  The result is a fascinating portrait of inter-war Britain, in which town and country, people and landscapes are captured as never before, in a truly unique and rich colour palette.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1926-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Open Road","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":9}
