As they brave the mighty Mississippi for three weeks on the not-so-trusty Rosemarie, the boys’ journey becomes a cavalcade of hijinks, near death experiences, nautical close calls and impromptu sing-alongs. Featuring an illustrious cast of characters met along the way and wonderful escapades with every dock they make, the film becomes a beautiful and hilarious adventure. Originally released online in weekly episodes, the film quickly became a much-lauded addition to the Ross brothers’ already beloved body of work. This is the first time River has ever been shown on the big screen in its feature version.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bf9zeMXC1BZYPw62GtA1wxVSYDi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"River","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
