Here, they enter from our left, hand in hand, a sylvan backdrop behind them. They're in fancy dress: he in three-piece suit and tie, bowler hat in hand; she in frilly floor-length dress, hat, and long braid of hair behind. They do a carefully choreographed dance - he's comic with large nose and male-pattern baldness splitting white curly hair; she's festive and smiling. They stay in sync. The camera is stationary, and it's one take.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope \u0026 Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1902-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foxy Grandpa and Polly in a Little Hilarity","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
