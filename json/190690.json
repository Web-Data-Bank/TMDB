When the attendant leaves the room the skeleton begins kicking his legs and throwing his arms about and suddenly turns into a magician. The magician produces an egg, performing several sleight-of-hand tricks, and places it upon the table with the small end downward. He then crudely draws a human face upon the shell, and the egg immediately begins growing larger and larger until it reaches the size of a normal head.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yenWXigsl8aQefLZpo2UsXME1k7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star-Film","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":37046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georges Méliès","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1903-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prolific Magical Egg","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":12}
