Mrs. Jamison has a very gossipy friend. When the friend spots Jamison on the street talking to an attractive young woman, she reports back to Mrs. Jamison that her husband is obviously having an affair. Mrs. Jamison storms out, and a few minutes later a guest arrives for a visit -- a Professor Brown. Jamison doesn't realize the professor is a woman, and Mrs. Jamison, who has returned, doesn't realize the woman is Professor Brown. She presumes she has caught her husband with his mistress. A dancing butler, a game-playing dog, and a very accommodating burglar complicate the situation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/as4ju2ViGapJu0BcI4D9lrUIPqZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Price Goofy?","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2}
