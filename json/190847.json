Unwilling to let the relief crew claim all the glory, he disobeys orders to pack up and goes out on an unauthorized expedition to collect further samples. But a routine excavation turns to disaster when the porous ground collapses and he falls into a deep crevice. His devastated colleagues attempt to recover his body. However, when another vanishes, they start to suspect that the life-form they have discovered is not without danger.","popularity":15.129,"poster_path":"/kxcQkAhpn8cvJTsU8PXblI5Qq8F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":892,"logo_path":null,"name":"Qwerty Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":18078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fantastic Films","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":1898,"logo_path":"/8ix6SGlJiyuUDxLBtY8E0PY2G7w.png","name":"Screen Ireland","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":10146,"logo_path":"/xnFIOeq5cKw09kCWqV7foWDe4AA.png","name":"Focus Features","origin_country":"US"},{"id":851,"logo_path":null,"name":"MEDIA Programme of the European Union","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-08-11","revenue":24084,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The search for life is about to end.","title":"The Last Days on Mars","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":701}
