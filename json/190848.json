The proprietor believes he's a penniless ne'er-do-well - which he is - but he unexpectedly comes into a small windfall. So the proprietor orders slightly rough around the edges Maud and Mollie, two of his American good time girls working their way around the world, to get him to spend all his money while there. As Donald ends up telling the two good time girls his life story - most specifically about the blonde he let slip through his fingers, she who was the love of his life - a few revelations and the errant coin he left at the roulette wheel betting table change his life.","popularity":0.964,"poster_path":"/9xhqIQGqbkJub1bxjuMRgW1She3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mack Sennett Comedies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broke in China","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
