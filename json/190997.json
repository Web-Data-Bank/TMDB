This was the final nationally and globally broadcast event held by the original and independent ECW before it filed for bankruptcy two months later. The main event was the first and only Tables, Ladders, Chairs and Canes match in ECW history for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, in which Steve Corino defended the title against The Sandman and Justin Credible. Rhino issued an open challenge which was answered by Rob Van Dam, but Van Dam was attacked by Jerry Lynn, leading to an immediate contest between the duo, and much more.","popularity":1.545,"poster_path":"/qdRRzB1yXehd3F9zuwAUoIVZJfs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17137,"logo_path":"/17Oe2J3GBV0rqsIeeT6jtaB8Jxv.png","name":"Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ECW Guilty as Charged 2001","video":true,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
