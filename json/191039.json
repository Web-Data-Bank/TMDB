Fortunately for Cassie, she works in a lab that has just created a serum to treat this disruptive condition. However, when subjects in the trial for this new drug start dropping dead, she uncovers a conspiracy that sends her on a dangerous pursuit of the truth. Will she fall asleep on the job? Let's hope not -- she's got a lot of bullets (and sleep-deprived hallucinations) to dodge along her road to justice.","popularity":1.292,"poster_path":"/bCmcZsKUM8Q226OKbYZVFieRZ5p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4598,"logo_path":"/y76nXOApEqxNI3EJFOikI1nhxx4.png","name":"Chesler/Perlmutter Productions","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":3431,"logo_path":"/bVTF0p5xlPfQhQIuBLr9BFtrKip.png","name":"Lifetime","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wide Awake","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
