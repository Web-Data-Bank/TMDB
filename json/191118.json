It isnâ€™t until later in the film that we learn exactly what we were watching. And that is exactly what Separation is all about. This is a film that masterfully uses sleight of hand like a highly-skilled magician to show us one thing while setting up something completely different. And writer/director Greg White brings it all together in a tense film with an exciting climax that pulls back all the curtains.","popularity":1.536,"poster_path":"/uctGXsSmnaTK2mpSSla5Lk3E8pD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young couple moves their struggling family to a small town, where a mysterious neighbor becomes a threat to their very existence.","title":"Separation","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":3}
