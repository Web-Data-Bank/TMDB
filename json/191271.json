For years, the lads were market leaders in Zurich, but now there is competition in the city: the “Girls.Messengers”. They are younger, prettier and have better business ideas. The Cooperative is on the verge of bankrupcy. They borrow money from Fat Frank, an old ally turned enemy, and launch a counter-campaign. Their marketing concept is adventurous. It can certainly be described as explosive. It ruins The Cooperative and their friendship… Almost.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/saf2jVjZfBiCxgBARf05nNCtyV9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160521,"logo_path":"/4MEFxcWzBU6BWJYZf0AmW8AdkJ2.png","name":"TILT Production","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2012-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Fucking Last","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
