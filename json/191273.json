This show marked both the consecration and the farewell of Elie Kakou to his public. This show, the artist's most accomplished, mixes great spectacle and humor through an incredible sound and visual delirium: in the company of dancers, trapeze artists, stilt walkers and whimsical characters, all on choreographies signed Rhéda; it is one of the most beautiful tributes to the world of the circus.","popularity":0.953,"poster_path":"/lJ5wPYKDRsmTRrd3ogqeufKY3uP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kakouphonie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Élie Kakou au Cirque d'Hiver","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
