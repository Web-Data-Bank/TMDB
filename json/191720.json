After spending 2 years and millions of dollars, the massive undertaking eventually fell apart, but the artists Jodorowsky assembled for the legendary project continued to work together. This group of artists, or his “warriors” as Jodorowsky named them, went on to define modern sci-fi cinema with such films as Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars and Total Recall.","popularity":8.266,"poster_path":"/qpEOJBtrQiGKVRoT9fF45ES1p0T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7787,"logo_path":"/mrDKpfx2bKUwEPuzYjmYrLW2Zoh.png","name":"Snowfort Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caméra One","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":14664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Endless Picnic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The greatest science fiction movie never made.","title":"Jodorowsky's Dune","video":false,"vote_average":7.891,"vote_count":542}
