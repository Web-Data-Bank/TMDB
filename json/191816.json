END is a research project into the image and the imagination of the end. Given its world premiere at HangarBicocca in Milan, for which it has been specially created as part of the wider Terre Vulnerabili project, END is a three-screen installation that represents a selection of the works produced by Carlos Casas during the decades of arduous research he carried out in the Aral sea, Patagonia and Siberia, channelled into three documentary films, a lengthy series of single-channel videos and various audio-visual live events.\"  - Excerpt from a text by Andrea Lissoni.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Journeys to the End of the World","title":"END Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1}
