The technical values are exemplary. The backgrounds are fine, making use of the natural world and excellent sets. The costuming is on a par with that, and the camera-work, although stodgy to the modern eye -- it never moves and the cuts are all leisurely -- are handsomely chosen and get the job done.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Figaro's Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
