It includes extremely rare, never before seen archival footage from the entire spectrum of his career. Featured are scenes from early club dates when Darrell was in his mid-teens during the \"Metal Magic\" days, and continuing through the meteoric rise of Pantera and the final days of Damageplan. Dimebag's offstage antics and his appetite for a great joke and laughter are also on prominent display. It brings back the raw emotion and fond memories of one of metal's truly great musicians! The DVD will be a must have for the huge legion of fans that Pantera and Damageplan amassed over the years. Running time is 73 minutes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9udY9uWJwiBJGVkutMH2HClOeaJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dimevision Vol 1: That's The Fun I Have","title":"Dimevision Vol 1: That's The Fun I Have","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
