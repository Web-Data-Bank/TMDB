With them he develops an intimate and poetic film, consisting of portraits of friends, walks through Barcelona and a trip to his native country, Venezuela, where chaos imposes its aesthetic appeal. A complex and fragmented film that shows the world of the filmmaker that sometimes happens to be as absurd and miraculous as a painting by Hieronymus Bosch.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zdpsuFIHgk9NhL0mOh230BKJOZ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color Runaway Dog","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
