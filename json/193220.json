The words of the restaurant's staff and guests are used in the film to paint a picture of modern China: the proprietress, one of the city's 20 self-made millionaires, speaks candidly about her failed marriage; a bridegroom-to-be who is celebrating at the restaurant explains the modern Chinese customs associated with the wedding party; and a waitress visits her poor parents in the countryside. Through these scenes, we gain insight into the unique combination of the ancient religious values and the new capitalist values with which China is stepping into the 21st century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fcXtoQwFv092ZfP9qLjx8eH6CQO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Drive Thru Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2008-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Biggest Chinese Restaurant in the World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
