The film component of the performance was ultimately never screened due to the absence of projection facilities at the venue. Long-believed to be lost, a workprint was discovered in 2008 and the film had its premiere in 2013.","popularity":3.289,"poster_path":"/3M5nR79sR1CASVvMMiM1lLTas6T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mercury Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Too Much Johnson","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":20}
