We start off with him been driven to the concert by Robbie Coltrane as the sort of taxi driver you don't want to get a lift from. Once inside he meets three of his comic heroes - Steve Martin, Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy (all played by Lenny) and then it's on with the stage show. He mixes stand up with appearances from some of his best known characters and there are a few amusing songs along the way.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Untamed.
