Using technology created by George Washington Carver, a three-person crew (plus one rambunctious robot) lift-off in Earth's first working spaceship on a mission that will take them to a world not unlike present-day America. Their spacey adventure illuminates some hard truths about American culture, and threatens to undermine the time-line of history along the way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yZtMbw8HDKmT0FxWPJbi84IeGGb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destination: Planet Negro!","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
