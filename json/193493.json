Three construction workers live together in a tiny apartment while building a new factory. When their foreman, Kolecki, is fired for neglecting his professional duties, the trio bands together to keep the production on course. With its focus on the dissatisfaction of everyday life and the breakdown of moral values, Kidawa's film echoes the \"cinema of moral concern\" associated with Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Zanussi. Pejzaz Horyzontalny offers a glimpse into an era when Communism still dominated, but unrest signaled changes ahead.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iVOv70RogITcrFRW3hxcsS7ZuGr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horizontal Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
