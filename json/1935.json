While in the city, she stays with her older sister, Martine, who in many ways is the exact opposite of Louise: she lives in a fashionable neighborhood, is cold to others, and has snobby friends, while Louise lives in a small town and is thoroughly unpretentious. Louise's apparent happiness -- and similarities to their mother -- gradually gets on Martine's nerves.","popularity":3.434,"poster_path":"/kvB5SYoP4qXzajrOgGvMVRl1Dh4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":796,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pan Européenne Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-11-21","revenue":10467048,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Finally reunited!","title":"Me and My Sister","video":false,"vote_average":5.541,"vote_count":61}
