A title card tells us this is an experiment in conveying the mental images of music in a visual form. Liszt's \"Second Hungarian Rhapsody\" is the music. The shapes, all two-dimensional, are circles primarily, with some squares and rectangles, and a few triangles. The shapes move rhythmically to the music: receding from view or moving across the screen. Red circles on a blue background; light blue squares; white rectangles. Then, a red background of many circles with a few in the foreground. Red gives way to blue then to white. Shapes reappear as Liszt's themes re-occur. Then, with a few staccato notes and images, it's over.","popularity":1.171,"poster_path":"/1yAfkkvRsmK8rbJD2m5W905jb56.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Optical Poem","video":false,"vote_average":6.547,"vote_count":32}
