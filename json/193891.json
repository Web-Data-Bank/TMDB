He plays it in the streets, in the park, in the streetcar (at least when he does not miss it!). When he unfortunately walks under a piano clumsy removers are hauling, the heavy instrument falls down on him and he swallows his clarinet. A lot of people try to extirpate the protruding instrument but they all fail. Three farriers finally succeed in making him return to his former self.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Générale des Cinématographes Éclipse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1912-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artheme Swallows His Clarinet","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
