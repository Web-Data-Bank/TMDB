The film is about five minutes long, and sandwiched between these aforementioned shots we see a collection of scenes of bathers on a beach. The majority of them grin at the camera like loons and follow it around like filings attracted to a magnet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Wannseebad.","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
