To be polite, he stops on the way at a bakery to bring along a small gift for the in-laws. Unfortunately, he steps on some flypaper and has a devil of a time getting it off himself. When he arrives at the dinner, he's quite sticky and this causes LOTS of problems--which would have all been alleviated had he told them of his flypaper predicament.  The title of the print gives the wrong date and title. Although there may well have been an earlier version with a similar plot (a number of films, which Max Linder made between 1905 and 1908, are still unidentified) it is quite clear that this particular one was made in 1910.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eCI28zrgHZo3sWV83wCdZ7qNNna.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1910-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max Gets Stuck Up","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2}
