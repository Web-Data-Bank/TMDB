He is not really keen about his father's black magic skills and is wiling away his time with two dumb cronies in a remote village. There he meets a girl named Malu (Poonam Bajwa), who has no memories about her past but falls pretty easily for the hero after a couple of songs. But they get separated soon after. Some years later, he is called by a wealthy family to exorcise a spirit (Muktha George) from their palatial house, Shenoy Mandir. He meets Malavika there but she doesn't recognise him.","popularity":2.429,"poster_path":"/hihTf8qGoYQQfQAVKgq1NrXPYwk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manthrikan","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
