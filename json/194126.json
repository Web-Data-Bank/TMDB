It raises questions that deserve in depth analysis and consideration. Questions include: Where do legends expand our thinking and where do they bury it? When does spiritual pursuit suddenly turn into fanaticism and violence? Last, have we as a society learned from our past, and if so have forgotten the lessons of the 20th Century? Are we now embarking on a new level only to learn the same old lessons about humanity again?  In addressing these questions we are taken into the back drop of the history of Germany beginning in the late 1800’s through the late 20th Century at the eve of the 21st.  “A society that does not take archetypes, myths, and symbols seriously will possibly be jumped by them from behind.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5zeIaHNQ3lFmOrWThbylMMcDy8g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elisabeth Müller Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1998-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Sun","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
