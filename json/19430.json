Shortly before the outbreak of World War II: Private Asch and gunner Vierbein belong to the same unit but could not be more contrary. The instructors use every opportunity to bully the clumsy Vierbein with erratic corporal Platzek leading the way. The harassment starts with minor extra duties but soon the methods become more and more brutal. Finally, Asch comes to Vierbein′s help and takes on his superiors. Joachim Fuchsberger stars in his first major role.","popularity":1.231,"poster_path":"/tMlqm2ScMqzvUPZvMUfWy8ONAH8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Divina-Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1954-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"08/15","video":false,"vote_average":7.056,"vote_count":9}
