The show was a sort of homecoming for frontman Sam Beam, who grew up a few hours from Atlanta, and he delivered a two-hour, 24-song set for the invitation-only audience of 500. The eleven-piece band played virtually all of Iron and Wine’s most recent album, Kiss Each Other Clean, plus favorites like “Naked as We Came” and “Boy with a Coin,” before Beam closed the remarkable night with a luminous solo version of the brand-new “Flightless Bird, American Mouth,” from the Twilight: Breaking Dawn soundtrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iron and Wine: Live From the Artists Den","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
