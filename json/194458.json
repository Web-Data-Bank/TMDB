Until now there hasn’t been a deﬁnitive ﬁlm made in Barcelona which explores the history, motivation, politics and the numerous characters involved in the street art scene.  The story follows the real life experience of Katrine Knauer as she develops her interest in Barcelona urban art through her photoblogging website called Mapping Barcelona Public Art and an 2012 street art exhibition featuring some of her discovered artists.  The ﬁlm was originally considered as a 5 minute documentary to complement the Las Calles Hablan exhibition but we later realised that a much bigger, more intriguing story needed to be told. The deeper we delved into this vibrant subculture the more we discovered and the more we got hooked.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4dezzq3HRkTMuJSq1lOnddEife7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Streets Talk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
