The test subject is Shin Kazamatsuri, motorcycle racer son of Doctor Kazamatsuri. Unknown to them, their operation is funded by a syndicate group, who plan to use this research to have the bodies of men strengthened for their own gain—they have already been experimenting in the field of cyborg soldiers, to a less-than-successful attempt. However, they did not count on Onizuka's own secret ambitions; the mad Onizuka wanted to create a new species, by fusing a grasshopper's DNA with the test subject's, in order to start a new civilization and be their god. He has tested on himself, but seems to be having greater success with Shin.","popularity":5.081,"poster_path":"/204MH13AMvmxR5t7T3I3My7pKfE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ishinomori Productions","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":11}
