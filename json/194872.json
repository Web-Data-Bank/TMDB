So when one night, a polite, well-dressed man offers an outrageous sum of money to rent the taxi for an extended period, Jong Woo doesn't ask any questions, though he does make rather cheerful and inappropriate conversation with his uninterested charge. It's difficult to blame Jong-Woo for this, given that it takes him some time to realize that he is not the protagonist of a low-brow comedy, but of an action-packed thriller.","popularity":3.096,"poster_path":"/ecsPVK2y8c6jNVOzRwKgrHeospy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112148,"logo_path":null,"name":"20th Century Fox Korea","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":7485,"logo_path":"/vpOrqLxZ6JkrCFdi3ZUWhHKmDEM.png","name":"Fox International Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":112528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cree Pictures","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":36270,"logo_path":"/diDSz5VPxV5AAYaDg1Ih8jJpCdu.png","name":"Korean Film Council","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Running Man","title":"Running Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":37}
