He is losing sight of his family and of why he became a churchman in the first place. Enter Dudley, an angel sent to help him. Dudley does help everyone he meets, but not necessarily in the way they would have preferred. With the exception of Henry, everyone loves him, but Henry begins to believe that Dudley is there to replace him, both at work and in his family's affections, as Christmas approaches.","popularity":8.204,"poster_path":"/2sMpffmvoJlW7WBcvyHTPR9DEsj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":798,"logo_path":"/nQgX1MOLySgug7FDONdIkht3xob.png","name":"Samuel Goldwyn Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Have you heard about Cary and the bishop's wife?","title":"The Bishop's Wife","video":false,"vote_average":7.115,"vote_count":195}
