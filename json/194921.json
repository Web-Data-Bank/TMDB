His powerful commentaries have made compelling reading in Vanity Fair for a quarter of a century. Now, aged 82, Dunne is covering his last murder trial for Vanity Fair -- the trial of music producer Phil Spector -- and reflects upon his past as a decorated WWII Veteran, his rise and spectacular collapse as a Hollywood producer, and his rebirth as the writer we know today. Dunne's mind offers a fascinating insight into the American psyche and its obsession with fame.","popularity":1.49,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kojo Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":36732,"logo_path":null,"name":"Road Trip Film","origin_country":""},{"id":36733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Art Media","origin_country":""},{"id":105801,"logo_path":"/3rh9RoodRlCw3urr21LG0gYZvSs.png","name":"MIFF Premiere Fund","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2008-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dominick Dunne: After the Party","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
