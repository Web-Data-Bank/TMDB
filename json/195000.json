How can he get out of it? On the advice of Wes, the out-and-proud best man, he pretends to be gay and gets caught kissing Wes. Little does Jake realize he's about to get caught up in a circle of jealousy and lies. Cliff, the groom, is getting married to help solidify his hunky, soap opera star image... and to stay closeted. Yep, he s gay. And his longtime boyfriend is none other than his best man. When Cliff and Wes get pictures taken of them in a compromising position (several, in fact) it looks as though his cover might be blown. Thrown into the mix is the bride's sex crazy mother and the nosy reporter-turned-wedding photographer with a sock puppet (pop icon Deborah Gibson). What ensues is a fun, quirky and modern comedy of errors that is sure to tickle your funny bone.","popularity":0.699,"poster_path":"/kqFEsXHz3L8HW3fU3lVLpPJSyzf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15073,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enlightenment Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Sexy Screwball Romantic Comedy","title":"My Girlfriend's Boyfriend","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
