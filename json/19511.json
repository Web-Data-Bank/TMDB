Taped at New York City's Beacon Theatre before a live audience, Ellen DeGeneres: Here and Now features the kind of humor that first made her a star, offering her offbeat insights into everyday life. Her feel-good humor touches on something that anyone can identify with, be it the obligatory gay joke, procrastination, fashion, public cell phone use, airline etiquette, or self-esteem.","popularity":2.0,"poster_path":"/aSM3dr8gBoDzwH2owhK2HBgbW7G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ellen DeGeneres: Here and Now","video":false,"vote_average":7.429,"vote_count":21}
