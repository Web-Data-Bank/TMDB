We see a parade cross Broadway onto Union Square with the mounted police, the band and then the Astor Battery. The footage of this short is still in very good condition, which adds a lot considering how little footage is available of these men.","popularity":0.741,"poster_path":"/7G7kmG0HTCfOofwyXauJcvmsc3z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1899-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Astor Battery on Parade","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":5}
