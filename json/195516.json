Famous shots from the movie include the first-ever aerial pictures of the tops of Africa's highest peaks, Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya. Along the journey, Martin filmed Osa surrounded by a pride of Lions and together they captured amazing scenes of a baboon colony, an event striking enough to give the movie its name.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baboona","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
