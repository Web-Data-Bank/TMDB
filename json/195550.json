A number of very fine automobiles pass in this strip, coming close to the camera and show clear and life size. A very strange coincidence in the closing of the picture is two old ladies who drive by in a dilapidates looking buggy drawn by a long eared mule. This is a remarkable picture showing up-to-date means of transportation in New York City, and the incident of the mule and the two old ladies adds a sufficient amount of humor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Ef5TnazRevJArBmNwJJuL5paSb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1900-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Automobile Parade","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
