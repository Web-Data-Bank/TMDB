This film lasts only 75-seconds but it's almost as if the director wanted to save the best for last. The first sixty-seconds are pretty lifeless as we barely get to see what's going on but once the torpedo is shot off things pick up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1900-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discharging a Whitehead Torpedo","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
