Next comes a chemical engine mounted on a stout double runner sled, which is followed closely by hose carriage apparatus mounted also on double runner sleds. Next comes a water tower mounted on a set of double runners and drawn by four beautiful horses. This is followed very closely by an engine drawn by a four-horse string team. This is followed by another engine on double runners, drawn by a four-horse tandem team. A second hose carriage and a Protective Insurance outfit brings up the rear. The breath leaves the horses' nostrils in great white puffs as they gallop through the snow-covered streets.","popularity":1.121,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1901-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montreal Fire Department on Runners","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
