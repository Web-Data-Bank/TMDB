Two bad boys appear. One of them climbs into a tree and scrambles out on an overhanging branch, directly over the happy pair. Just as the love-making reaches a climax, the branch breaks. The boy falls into the hammock, the hammock breaks, and the boy and the lovers are mixed up on the ground. Exceedingly ludicrous.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1901-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love in a Hammock","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
