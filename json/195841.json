This manifesto denounces a new form of slavery: The immigrants desperately seek work, a place to live, but find themselves face to face with indifference, rejection, humiliation…until the final call for uprising. “Soleil Ô” is the title of a West Indian song that tells of the pain of the black people from Dahomey (now Benin) who were taken to the Caribbean as slaves.","popularity":1.199,"poster_path":"/ffvsrK5iYCAqgcA3X9OzspduR13.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shango Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":84230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grey Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MR","name":"Mauritania"}],"release_date":"1973-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh, Sun","video":false,"vote_average":6.667,"vote_count":15}
