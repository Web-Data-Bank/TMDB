As the tram veers into Bridge Street the filmmakers capture an excellent panorama of Patrick's Bridge, one of the city's major landmarks, and the bustling atmosphere of the commercial centre. This kind of 'phantom ride' was a staple of early film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1902-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tram Ride from King Street to Patrick's Bridge, Cork","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
