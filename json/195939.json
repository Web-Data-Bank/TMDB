A juggler summons two chairs, which come to the stage jumping and twirling around. Across the back of these chairs the operator places a sheet of glass on which he lays a box about four inches high. He then takes a table cover, with his servant's help, rolls it up and from the centre emerges a lady, beautifully dressed. At the juggler's order she jumps in the box, in which she completely disappears.","popularity":0.974,"poster_path":"/9DJq8wiSNgPQeJjDjrEhNUVGE7N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1903-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mysterious Box","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":12}
