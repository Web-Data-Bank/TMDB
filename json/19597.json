Fascinated by art and philosophy, she questions and documents her life and immediate circle, drawing trenchant and often hilarious observations on the world around her. But as her appointment with death approaches, Paloma finally meets some kindred spirits in her building's grumpy janitor and an enigmatic, elegant neighbor, both of whom inspire Paloma to question her rather pessimistic outlook on life.","popularity":5.325,"poster_path":"/dGV6PP3m871ur8pUFWR3NUysTi2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10400,"logo_path":"/9LlB2YAwXTkUAhx0pItSo6pDlkB.png","name":"Eagle Pictures","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":2280,"logo_path":"/rYrkINGzLKCsL74y2A9zPDaSwUG.png","name":"Les Films des Tournelles","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7981,"logo_path":"/6Yv1gIAuGkHS5Vis4UjnqHhCPWV.png","name":"Pathé","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":79418,"logo_path":null,"name":"Topaze Bleue","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2009-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let Life In.","title":"The Hedgehog","video":false,"vote_average":7.247,"vote_count":348}
