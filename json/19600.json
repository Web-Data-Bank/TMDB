It’s in the city’s “useless landscape” that the lonely hearts of nine characters will cross destinies and they’ll discover new passions. The meeting place for these journeys is a charming English teacher, Mary Ann Simpson, former airline stewardess, who’s been living in Rio for two years, since she became a widow, and the newly separated Pedro Paulo. They approach each other without a hint that their lives will be linked by many characters and incidents.","popularity":2.231,"poster_path":"/8U2ixqJhdTGqszU44CBpx68PIoD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The difference between \"amor\" and \"love\".","title":"Bossa Nova","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":24}
