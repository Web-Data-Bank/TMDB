Screened in four parts, lasting a total of approximately twelve minutes, it shows a bunch of old boys, some in full military regalia, others in top hats and suits travelling by boat from one dock to another. From there they make up part of a parade as they travel to a hotel. The men are Russian and Japanese envoys gathered by President Teddy Roosevelt to hammer out a peace deal to bring the Russo-Japanese war to an end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1905-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scenes and Incidents, Russo-Japanese Peace Conference, Portsmouth, N.
