(From a piece of grey cloth over the entrance to the cave, two 8-pointed white stars hang incongruously: the Production company's logo.) A pan hangs from a tripod. A girl in a colorful dress arrives with a Bucovina shepherd dog, and starts dancing in front of the men. First, half of the men go, then the others and the girl leave. Only one man stays, taking care of the food being prepared in the pot. Snivelling from their hiding place, a robber jumps him, and knocks him out with a blow. Three thugs join him, and they take whatever they find in the cave (guns). The dog comes back, and sits a while near the fallen cook. The Arabs return, and are alarmed at the robbery, and the killing of their cook. Meanwhile, somewhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/66CCQ9gV2HYz4MnbSetsFbuh3Fb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saturn-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1907-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Abduction of the Slave Women","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":10}
