The film runs just a few seconds short of four minutes as several women are dressed up as bees dancing around their hive. The \"Queen Bee\" goes to take a nap and she's attacked by a spider. The spider sequence is what gets this film a mention by fantasy fans but sadly this scene takes place around the 3:13 mark and lasts just a few seconds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1908-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bee and the Rose","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5}
