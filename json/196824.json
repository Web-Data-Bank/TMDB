Three demanding children and a strong career seem to be plenty. Men are certainly a finished chapter. Until Fredrik suddenly appears. He's interesting, attractive and mature; all in all quite perfect for Maria. Finally there is a reason to believe in love again. But then Jonas appears. He's charming, very funny and 25 years old. Maria starts to lose her control, and falls in love. This all gets very complicated when her ex-husband Lasse returns, demanding full custody of the children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m60Ae1qRG2lFdApFfLA1MIGRE73.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2006-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Happiness Never Comes Alone.","title":"Maria's Men","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
