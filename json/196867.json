Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan. But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks—advised by his brilliant VP and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor—makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.","popularity":28.825,"poster_path":"/33WsmnE5M2SSGrZCQW4dlr2D5WG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marcy Media","origin_country":""},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7291,"logo_path":"/eo8YnSO7wpUHVEprnMDOUcalhFD.png","name":"Olive Bridge Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":907,"logo_path":"/ca5SWI5uvU985f8Kbb4xc8AmVWH.png","name":"Overbrook Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-12-19","revenue":133821816,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's a Hard Knock Life","title":"Annie","video":false,"vote_average":6.23,"vote_count":1190}
