But a very large spanner is thrown into the works when Robert learns his late, eccentric, and very wealthy Uncle Leopold has willed them 23 million dollars. There is, of course, a catch -- before Robert and Alexandra can get the money, they have to conceive and give birth to a healthy child within a year. Given that there will be enough money to go around for everyone, Robert and Alexandra decide to give it a try, which doesn't ease any of the tensions in their old relationships -- or make things run any smoother in their new relationships. Love and Greed (aka Love $ Greed) also features David Charles and Ivan Roth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5R65fTcr9z9jC4RjL3WQcz1a5IN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love $ Greed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
