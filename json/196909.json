You will not, however, hear any dialog. Words do not prepare, do not accompany, do not comment upon the action. This is not a silent film, but a film in which the only moment of life retained for the cinematographic spectacle are those where people do not speak. The spectator will find, perhaps, a greater freedom of interpretation in it and, we hope, a particular pleasure in this.\" (Alain Cavalier)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/53svCSRzElrOrLVRe1SoWugXhfa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":694,"logo_path":"/5LEHONGkZBIoWvp1ygHOF8iyi1M.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cin√©ma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":311,"logo_path":"/TNGvZ8zOklntjPP3EcsHtrR8Rc.png","name":"PROCIREP","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Libera me","video":false,"vote_average":6.917,"vote_count":6}
