One note dominates the narration, that of continuity between past and present, and also the camerawork -- contrived to be as artful and art filled as the narration. Modern and ancient architecture and other cultural attributes of Prague, including scenes from the stage play Amadeus serve as a backdrop to the lecture on the nature of Prague history -- a non-stop \"continuity of consciousness.\"","popularity":0.708,"poster_path":"/s90BexfyXZ6F7YfY3Ekyyfxb4bD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prague","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
