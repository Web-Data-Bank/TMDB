His girlfriend deeply resents his having sex with other women but doesn't seem much bothered that a rich German man he's been having sex with is hoping to sponsor him in Europe. She also has a hard time with his tendency to behave like any other Arab male around a woman, telling her how to take care of her business. As it turns out, she's got better sense than any of the men around her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1l8345SCgAH4iqQn8iHQw98VaZu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bezness","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
