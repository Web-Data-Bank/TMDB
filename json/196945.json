He turned his punishment into a reward by creating a little paradise in what is today the holiday resort, Bodrum. In fact he is considered by some to be the first ecologist. The film concentrates on this latter aspect of his character and through flashbacks portrays the inner turmoil of a man who is trying to come to terms with his past. The slow pace is somewhat of a drawback, the flashbacks are often confusing and the protagonist is not always very convincing. But the photography of the country side is exceptional Kenan Ormanlar and the short appearance by a very theatrical Hanna Schygulla of Fassbinder fame adds a little spice to the drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tnabzQ9SsAVtUhQs6k3SDQjt0OD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":159251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kenmovie Filmcilik","origin_country":""},{"id":93169,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kentel Film","origin_country":""},{"id":5983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stefi 2","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1993-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Exile","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5}
