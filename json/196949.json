When he takes the wages that he is owed out of the till, not only does the owner throw him out, but he has him beaten up, to boot. Enzo (Mario Adorf), the owner of a restaurant so far off the beaten track it is widely known as Abissinia rather than being called by its true name, takes him in. The leisurely pace of everything that is done at the restaurant leaves Antonio with plenty of time to put together the story of its owner and the love of his life, and how he, too, fell from culinary glory to his present obscurity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dWxqr9Qo1pAVU753WddW6OJk3Y4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abissinia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
