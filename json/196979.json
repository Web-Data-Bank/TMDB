As a result of his on-again, off-again relationship with the beautiful and insatiable Luigia (Sabrina Ferilli), his thoughts along these lines have grown increasingly bizarre. For his own part, he is driven to pick up and bed women at almost every opportunity. As the fantasies recorded in his diary consume more and more of his life, and grow darker and darker, his ordinary waking life becomes flatter and duller, until he disappears altogether.","popularity":1.401,"poster_path":"/pbYlNi9nVybjgbA4OLXmGxs751S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54381,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Olografica Italiana (SOI) S.r.l.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1993-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary of a Maniac","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":14}
