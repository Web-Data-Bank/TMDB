(\"Chang'an\" literally means \"long peace.\") Ai and his team of videographers stopped at 50-meter intervals to record each fixed shot. The result is an impassive yet revelatory videologue that charts the blood flow of Beijing through its supermodern heart to its impoverished extremities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lNyGyFXe3150h9yHkajnVGqeEED.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ai Weiwei Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2012-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":613,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chang'an Boulevard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
