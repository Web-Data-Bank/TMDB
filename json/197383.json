Here it is used to refer to a ganandi, literally 'to make dance'  This film concerns two women whom the zima [priest] had diagnosed some months before as being ill through possession by spirits.  In the meantime, their families have gathered together the resources to pay for the musicians, dancers, and the priest himself to put on an initiation dance lasting seven days This is a film of documentation, simply recording various moments in the progress of the ceremony, without any form of explanation, neither in intertitle cards nor in voice-over.
