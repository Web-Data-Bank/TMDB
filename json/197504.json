This compelling political thriller uncovers two prime suspects: the woman who guns the leader down, and a man who was friends with both the prime minister and his murderer. Using video surveillance footage, as well as other more artful and symbolic imagery, the noted \"visualist\" director Miklos Jancso, who is known for his craft in getting his points across non-verbally, combines fantasy and reality in a highly ironic manner.","popularity":1.21,"poster_path":"/ajwfm6F8MPoT5bwaJ18e3H2Lca7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1992-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Danube Waltz","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4}
