In the outer story, Andre Dussolier stars as a film director working with drama students at the Paris Conservatory, making a film (the inner story) about a woman's obsession with a foreign desert. Wallowing in maudlin sentimentality, this feature fails to live up to the promise of its probable inspiration, Fame (1980), and was not well-received at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. However, as a medium for instructing director Francis Girod's actual students at the Paris Conservatory about the art and perils of filmmaking, it was undoubtedly a good deal more successful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1ddGGw2GAV1HE6vkf5jrQsah7sH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films A2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Partner's Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1988-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'enfance de l'art","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7}
