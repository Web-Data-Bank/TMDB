Leon, the con-artist makes his living cheating Catholic bingo players by hosting bogus religious pilgrimages. He is involved with a woman, but that doesn't stop him from getting involved with the frustrated Sophie who hates living in a tiny apartment with her lazy husband, her ever-gloomy teenage daughter and her husband's demanding, self-centered father, Emile. Sophie is so desperate to escape and start a new life that she convinces Leon to help her kill Emile who allegedly has $150,000 tucked away. The murder is to occur during one of Leon's pilgrimages. He convinces his son Paolo, an ex-con, to assist. Despite their careful planning, nothing prepares the would-be killers for the surprising result.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5yfhC93UvZDJLKX33haT8NeTL4J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'oreille d'un sourd","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
