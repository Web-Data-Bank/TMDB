Due to wars, bad economy and politics, there seem to be no perspective husbands around, and these young women are protesting the conditions that have left them spinsters. The bureaucrat, accompanied by an assistant and a little boy who seems to be both guide and interpreter leads the search to find the women.","popularity":0.782,"poster_path":"/5FPLc8biTncdWVyWUEiMOepiQpy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2440,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mij Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2012-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About 111 Girls","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":7}
