Her tragic death dominated Moroccan and international media in March 2012. Amina had accused a young man in her village of rape, but because authorities failed to properly investigate her accusations, she was married to her rapist following a citation from article 475 of the Moroccan penal code. This article dismisses a rapist of his charges as long as he marries his victim. A year after her marriage, Amina swallowed rat poison, walked into the village market, and died. Through this horrifying affair, the film explores the legal, political, religious and social issues that plague Moroccan women - chipping away at the facade of equality that disguises a deep-seated patriarchal system.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":"/yQB9UnBrlB6QmsRbG1WzqF53d7T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2013-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"475","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
