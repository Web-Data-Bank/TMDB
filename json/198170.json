The film conjures her with a phantasmagoric seance in the suite at the hotel Waldorf Astoria in New York where she lived in the 1950s. Her presence is reproduced by three algorithms: the camera becomes her eyes, a computer reconstructs the prosody of her voice and a robot recreates her handwriting. The dead is incarnated in an image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marilyn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
