While investigating the violent killing, Mesa, Arizona police retrieved a digital camera from Alexander’s washing machine, revealing shocking images authorities claim Arias took during their sexual escapades, as well as during and after his murder. While Jodi pled not guilty and contends she killed Alexander in self-defense, police concluded that when he broke off their relationship, she stalked her ex-boyfriend and seduced him one final time before murdering him in cold blood. Her subsequent trial has been grand theater, dominating the cable news networks as she testified in her own defense and offered explicit insight into the sex, lies and obsession that led up to Alexander’s murder.","popularity":6.743,"poster_path":"/vVFH56GOfpbZbPk25VH9v7ehvnF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12799,"logo_path":"/mRkrTKpJswgIRmMVX8pYt0t6FGU.png","name":"Silver Screen Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":30116,"logo_path":null,"name":"City Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":8899,"logo_path":null,"name":"PeaceOut Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":38}
