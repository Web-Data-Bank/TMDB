An army recruiter forces Theodore to enlist in the King's army, and not even the religious robe is an insurance against it. Theodore is assigned to be aide-de-camp to Alcibiade, a man as virile in combat, as he seems troubled for the figure of his aid. D'Albert, an aristocrat, will expose Theodore's true sex, and after a number of confusing, comedy situations, Alcibiade will appease his troubled feelings.","popularity":1.016,"poster_path":"/5VUw0cPq72mxWCOjCIPot6oaUJF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tecisa Film","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":10481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jolly Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":52382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Servis","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Consortium Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1966-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mademoiselle de Maupin","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":7}
