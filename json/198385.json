The star surgeon Prof. Gerhard Harrer works here. Katrin has known and admired the professor since her assistantship. But then her heroic image of Professor Harrer begins to falter. The young doctor seems to be the only one to notice that the luminary apparently has an alcohol problem. But nobody believes you.
