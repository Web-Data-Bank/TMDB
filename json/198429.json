The trouble begins when a rather imposing, pompous senator comes to visit a small rural Romanian town for a ribbon-cutting ceremony for their new hydro-electric dam. After he finishes his speech, the senator is accosted by a Swiss film crew eager to interview him. The senator is inordinately concerned with presenting a positive image of Romania to the world at large and so when he learns that he and the journalists are to stay at the same villa, does everything he came to make sure that they see nothing scandalous.","popularity":0.817,"poster_path":"/aay601cGXiY8gFTng1IN1dOqVVe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio of Cinematographic Creation of the Romanian Ministry of Culture","origin_country":""},{"id":95538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alpha Films International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1995-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Snails' Senator","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":9}
