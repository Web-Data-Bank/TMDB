When Louis the Fourteenth (1638-1715) was born, the power of government was shared between the monarchy, the church, the nobility, and the Parlement. His predecessor had greatly centralized the powers of government following the advice of Cardinal Richelieu. Louis XIV (often called \"The Sun King\" for the brilliance of his rule) followed the advice of Richelieu's successor, Cardinal Mazarin (Paolo Graziosi), and brought the powers of government under the sole sway of the monarch. He expanded the territory and influence of France in a series of wars throughout his reign. How he came to be so autocratic and ruthless both personally and politically is the subject of this biographical drama.","popularity":2.316,"poster_path":"/9jYgDAGe6mDz0izWo6TazMBQT1g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223,"logo_path":"/pdthRbCuXNlrGNwnmLFRxv5Zy3t.png","name":"Les Films du Losange","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Louis, the Child King","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":10}
