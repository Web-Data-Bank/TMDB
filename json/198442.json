However, this painterly film is so filled with striking and surreal imagery that it would be misleading to say that the story is of any great importance in relation to that.","popularity":1.42,"poster_path":"/sWJIQGdcFipKNKGX9pQZguUGztX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victoria Film","origin_country":""},{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1991-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anna Karamazoff","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7}
