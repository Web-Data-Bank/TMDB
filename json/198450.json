It was commissioned by the Portuguese master of style, director Manoel de Oliveira from composer João Paes. Musically, it ranges from 19th-century romanticism to popular, modernist and even \"post-modernist\" styles. In the initially tame story, a host-narrator tells the story of a wedding between the two lovebirds: Viscount d'Aveleda and the beautiful Marguerite. However, what happens in the bridal chamber is incredibly bizarre. The events after that are even stranger (the film out-does even Luis Buñuel in that department), and the wedding guests and family indulge in cannibalism, among other perversions.","popularity":1.1,"poster_path":"/nywvSeIdnlOcXhS4iaaHxigx27x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmargem","origin_country":""},{"id":6584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1988-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A drama following stories of characters from the Portuguese High Society.","title":"The Cannibals","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":13}
