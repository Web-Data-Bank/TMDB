A terminally ill writer (Jozef Kroner) of national prominence watches as family and friends gather like vultures for his imminent demise. Relli (Alexander Bardini) smiles and pretends to be the writer's friend as he tries to get his hands on an unpublished manuscript. The opening scene is the highlight of the film. While the dead writer is being laid to rest in a national funeral, he emerges from the coffin and walks into his own grave while the mourners flee in terror.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Manuscript","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
