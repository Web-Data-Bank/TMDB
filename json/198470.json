Clara's father was a Communist who fought the Nazis in Argentina and possessed a list of the top Nazi exiles and their contacts. Through a former lover, Clara -- a successful broadcast journalist -- begins to see her Jewish roots (and the leftists) in a whole new light. Meanwhile, the political storms sweeping through Argentina are setting the stage for the Peronist government to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9jYfoXrCCcNFC2B8Pmzp7fGpjCM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Raúl de la Torre Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":79606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bensil Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1986-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poor Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
