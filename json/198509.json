One of the men is of Italian origin, another is the wealthy heir of a shipping fortune, and the third is the son of a Jewish antique-store owner. Before the war, they are fast friends, enjoying one another's company at carnivals and at a private fencing club. However, when the war comes, the Italians and Germans move in to create the Independent State of Croatia. The Italian friend becomes a fascist and courts and marries the sister of his rich friend. Soon enough, atrocities are being committed, and anyone suspected of Jewish or Serbian parentage or anti-fascist leanings, is killed.","popularity":0.699,"poster_path":"/hO0FVxcF8vedycGdicIHzGqcBq2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168,"logo_path":"/AmNSNdDaByDpc0bzekWFeYRXDW2.png","name":"Jadran Film","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":16785,"logo_path":null,"name":"Croatia Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1978-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Occupation in 26 Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":7}
