Then he leaves, disappearing in the snow. Later, the people he appeared to have upset have gathered to search for him and find him frostbitten, but alive. Visiting him at the sanatorium to which he has been taken, they gradually discover what was really happening.","popularity":1.074,"poster_path":"/hIPRcNTHxum1c2RaByg3NHSRI89.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Polski","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1978-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spiral","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":11}
