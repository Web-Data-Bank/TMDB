Ironically, the doctor's life is not a very happy one either, and his boast has a hollow sound. For one thing, although he seemingly has a \"happy divorce,\" in which he, his ex-wife and her new husband are all great pals, it's not true. He wants his wife back. All sorts of complications arise out of these lies and distortions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lfEoDPt7ROYLgQiKylrBxX51eF8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Union Générale Cinématographique (UGC)","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1975-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Happy Divorce","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
