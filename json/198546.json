The movie irreverently draws on both the Shakespeare play and the 1877 story by Jules Laforgue. In the story, Hamlet (Carmelo Bene) is a would-be playwright. He suffers from inept Freudian analysis by Polonius (Pippo Tuminelli), and Ophelia and Gertrude (Isabella Russo & Luciana Cante) are women conjured up in his erotic imagination.","popularity":1.245,"poster_path":"/gE5D5ZjbCegBwmqlxY2mBQPTjK1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Donatello Cinematografica","origin_country":""},{"id":13561,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministero del Turismo e dello Spettacolo","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1973-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Hamlet Less","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":12}
