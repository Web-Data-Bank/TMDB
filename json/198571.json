The film charts Keane's musical progression from a four-piece guitar band to the three-piece piano-based group that they've become today, and shows how they went on from playing tiny gigs on the UK pub circuit, to winning 2 Brits awards and selling nearly 5 million albums around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r864tX0EREBHAQITdXfdhdJWmJk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152058,"logo_path":null,"name":"White House Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keane - Strangers","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
