Every year on Swiss National day, August 1, the Wildheuer climb up the steep mountain of the «Hinteren Heubrig», fitted out with scythes and wearing wooden shoes with spikes, just as their ancestors did before them. They are part of a generation who have lived with the challenges of nature and survived it. In his film, Langjahr's poetic realism gives an insight into these people's experience of the simple life, the very foundation of human existence.","popularity":0.742,"poster_path":"/QKOoBQaCwWUBmc6qV1JRhq5bEe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Langjahr-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2006-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alpine Saga","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
