Galina Vishnevskaya stars as Katerina, a bored 19th century farm wife. At the behest of her grungy lover, Katerina murders her husband and her father-in-law. She and her new beau are both sent to Siberia, where the lover almost immediately takes up with a younger woman. Banned by Stalin for its bleak portrait of Soviet life, Katerina Izmailova was not given a Russian staging for over 40 years; its Metropolitan Opera debut did not occur until 1994. Dmitri Shostakovich also wrote the screenplay for the screen version of Katerina Izmailova.","popularity":0.961,"poster_path":"/At9YBmcPYZuXT9Wn4ptcWxv6mtt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":410,"logo_path":"/eZlhJ4iCRM90hLB4RCC6RJEC9zr.png","name":"Sovkino","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1966-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katerina Izmailova","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
