With military repression in full force, a peasant woman finds herself alone in her house in the mountains when her only son is taken away by French soldiers soon after her husband is killed in a raid. One day, on seeing a dead chicken, which she considers a bad omen, she decides to leave home, and sets off on a tiring journey through the mountains. With a pair of chickens in tow, she moves from one detention camp to the next in a desperate search for her missing son. The film was inspired by events experienced by the family of its director.","popularity":0.831,"poster_path":"/2BnYsm7acThCQVqlP6sIFze1aNU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1640,"logo_path":null,"name":"O.N.C.I.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1967-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Winds of the Aures","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
