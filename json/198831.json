Rocio must mourn the death of a relative for six months and is forbidden to see Raphael. Very much in love, they are frustrated by the old-fashioned customs of their village. When they can finally see each other, the two plan to soon marry. Unfortunately, the girl's grandfather dies and she must start the process of mourning all over again. This time Raphael begs her to rebel against her family and the villagers, but she refuses for fear of persecution. When Rocio has had enough of putting her own happiness aside, she decides to run away with Raphael in spite of what her family will say. Things do not go as planned, however, when yet another family member passes away.","popularity":1.378,"poster_path":"/lGo3C5wMtsOTeAImiRjuW1XxWML.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12716,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eco Films","origin_country":""},{"id":1183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Impala","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1964-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl in Mourning","video":false,"vote_average":5.036,"vote_count":14}
