Seeking out a rich uncle, the idealistic nephew is rejected by his miserly relation, and he goes on to get involved with a shady woman and a band of gun runners who supply arms for the revolution of the week. Charles and his new girlfriend head for the border after a shootout with federal troops, and a kindly railroad worker hides the couple in an abandoned copper mine. Charles is later thrown in prison while the girl becomes a concubine, but her violator is killed when Charles escapes to rescue her and exact revenge. A pretty harrowing composition could be written by the young couple on \"How I Spent My Summer Vacation.\"","popularity":0.73,"poster_path":"/riqjW8vlcLGL2YIqx7TmdmsLpct.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Franco London Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1147,"logo_path":"/tBDaGOA04LmlsbLvMwHjR7WzT9H.png","name":"Madeleine Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":126244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zebra Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1963-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rat Trap","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
