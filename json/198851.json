The small, traveling circus has been sliding downhill for awhile, and unless some new life is infused into its acts, its future does not look very rosy. Into this precarious situation comes a new mime with the uncanny ability to sap the confidence of his fellow performers. If he continues for long in this vein, no one will be able to believe they have any talent left at all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lB9hODCooPmilaqUO7BJpDVdFFJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52346,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespół Filmowy \"Rytm\"","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1962-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Impossible Goodbye","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
