In one story, a little fellow has set his heart on buying a sewing machine for his mother. Like the other shoe-shine boys, his goal of saving up money is almost impossible to meet yet after much travail he is finally able to get her a machine. Sadly enough, his triumph is destined to be short-lived when the much-desired sewing machine is broken in an accident. Undaunted, the lad decides the only thing for it is to start again from scratch.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AaUuQnIbNnXjEJ9EBZ6t7uSG8gF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"1962-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":185,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
