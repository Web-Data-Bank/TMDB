Rather than receiving some special dispensation, it turns out that in Yugoslavia this was the custom. Most of the time, the men here are engaged in pursuits that forward their relationships with the fairer sex, as might be expected after a long and lonely incarceration. There is nothing particularly profound about their two weeks of liberty, and no deep message in the tale.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fTP83UbCrJbGwHKsgVR3spYq0ys.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lovćen Film","origin_country":"YU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1960-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fourteenth Day","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":6}
