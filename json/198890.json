She has her many brothers and sisters to support, and there is no one else to do the job. So she rallies her defenses and sets out to give her rival in the ferry business a run for his money. But at the same time, the rival's handsome son is starting to look better and better. Madalena refuses to acknowledge her feelings for him -- though how long she can sustain that denial is the question.","popularity":0.82,"poster_path":"/cByEaFxf0Pr8j4BXIY47Zs4epMG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12093,"logo_path":"/a5l879HvnNElhZ5gxRWB5QVBuUp.png","name":"Finos Film","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1960-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madalena","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":14}
