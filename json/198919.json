One candidate is a staunch if not deluded conservative and the other is a radical liberal. Anticipating modern election campaigns by a good half a century, the two candidates decide that the best way to win is to sling as much mud as possible. Lacking the Internet and fifteen-second TV spots, they do the best they can -- they send each other virulent telegrams denouncing each other's personal failings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sejJZ0035heuU8nPC6MlOxwLM3D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74057,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmstudio București","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1960-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Telegrams","video":false,"vote_average":7.143,"vote_count":7}
