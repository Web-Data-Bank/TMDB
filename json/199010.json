Every fourth child is already sick and the parents must helplessly watch as their young ones die.  Now Koch is undertaking to find the cause of the tuberculosis --- something he has already been working on for years --- which has been causing this plague of illness.  His work is made more difficult by envy; for example, that of his teacher, who was wounded defending his honor.  But his greatest obstacle is the famous Berliner scientist and Reichstag deputy, Privy Councilor Rudolf Virchow:  He is extraordinarily skeptical of Koch's theory, that the cause for tuberculosis is a bacteria.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vCTnl87QREO1gsVJXbNSo2dL2Gr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1939-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robert Koch, der Bekämpfer des Todes","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
