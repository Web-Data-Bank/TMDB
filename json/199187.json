Omar Sharif stars as a naïve young man who is taken for granted by friends and family. Little do they know that he has more intelligence, tenacity and imagination than all of them put together. The story takes an unexpectedly dramatic turn when the man falls in love with the young wife of his village's elderly \"wise man\". Based on an ancient Tunisian folk tale, Goha boasts impressive production values and sure-handed direction (by Jacques Baratier).","popularity":0.766,"poster_path":"/qznXLHiADt1NFt1sybejPXZqMkn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Franco-Africains","origin_country":""},{"id":117408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Secrétariat d'État à l'information du Gouvernement Tunisien","origin_country":""},{"id":7248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Union Générale Cinématographique (UGC)","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1959-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goha","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
