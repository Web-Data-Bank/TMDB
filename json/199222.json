The bulk of the story takes place in a single Roman neighborhood. In the manner of the 1925 German classic A Joyless Street, director Mauro Bolognini studies the hopes, dreams, successes and failures of the neighborhood's various and sundry denizens. No one subplot dominates the proceedings, though a bit of extra time is afforded the story of a fickle seamstress and her seemingly meek-and-mild boyfriend. The cast is dotted with such reassuringly familiar faces as Nino Manfredi and Gino Cervi. Released in the US as Wild Love, Gli Innamorati was instrumental in bringing international fame to director Bolognini, whose career soon shifted into high drive.","popularity":1.081,"poster_path":"/rOUcBqbLDD5FDwboNThcWDlO8wx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Metzger et Woog","origin_country":""},{"id":59160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alessandro Iacovoni Produzione Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1955-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":8}
