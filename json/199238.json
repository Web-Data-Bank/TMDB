It also pays lots of attention to the two daughters of the aging and irascible ringmaster-circus owner. The high points are the sound (and score) and cinematography featuring a lot of vertiginous panning (appropriate - as high wire trapeze artists are also an important element in the film). A fascinating side-light on 30s Japan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jHeo9XVbwqhNYKzu4tyLE85yUrk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54049,"logo_path":null,"name":"P.C.L.
