The \"lost continent\" of the title is Asia, specifically Indonesia, here lovingly photographed in Ferraniacolor by Mario Craveri, Giannni Rafaldi and Franco Bernetti. Highlights include a Cantonese wedding aboard a floating junk, the annual wheat and rice harvest, the animal-sacrifice rites at the rim of a volcano, a ceremonial chariot race, and a bevy of Balinese dancers. Though there's no story to speak of, the film has the rhythm and pace of a \"continuity\" picture. Continente Perduto was the winner of a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bA2i2juruTLEP47rl3ZSElw2bX8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49138,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astra Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1955-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Continent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
