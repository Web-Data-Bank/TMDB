Lollobrigida acquits herself quite nicely in the tensely dramatic role of a much-put-upon small-town girl named Cemma. Seduced by a lad who turns out to be a relative, Cemma is tossed out of her home. Seeking security, she impulsively marries bookish science professor Franco Vagnuzzi (Gabriele Ferzetti). Bored by her marriage, Cemma doesn't realize the true value of her loving husband until it's almost too late. The original 118-minute run time was reduced for U.S. release.","popularity":1.327,"poster_path":"/g46GkYVZhaudQgQFPrJKNx3KREA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62151,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electra Compagnia Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1953-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wayward Wife","video":false,"vote_average":5.944,"vote_count":9}
