The villain is Berthet (Jean Debucourt), a high-ranking government official. Basquier suspects that Berthet is a vicious murderer, but is unable to prove anything thanks to bureaucratic interference. Thus, the good inspector plays a waiting game a la Columbo, hoping for that one fatal slip on the part of the killer. Certain portions of Identite Judiciare proved a bit too intense for American audiences, and were accordingly snipped by the censors.","popularity":0.751,"poster_path":"/j4yajjJSdv6LuEgblSZfS7nt2DR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris Vice Squad","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
