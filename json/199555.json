This new system manipulates the environment in a way which can: * Disrupt human mental processes. * Jam all global communications systems. * Change weather patterns over large areas. * Interfere with wildlife migration patterns. * Negatively affect your health. * Unnaturally impact the Earth's upper atmosphere. The U.S. military calls its zapper HAARP (High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program). But this sky buster is not about the Northern Lights. The device will turn on lights never intended to be artificially manipulated.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angels Don't Play This HAARP - Advances in Tesla Technology","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
