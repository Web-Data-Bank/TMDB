Set in the city of Hangzhou (where Yang had studied at the China Academy of Fine Art), the film takes as its focal point a restless young man, Zhu Zi, following him as he aimlessly wanders through the city. Through a series of distinct vignettes, Yang depicts Zhu Zi's inability to find comfort in friends, lovers or environment as a reflection of the existential difficulty of China's \"nameless generation,\" cast adrift during the rapid changes at the turn of the millennium.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rezgY1NgrehCWqxoLYdxV2aKme3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2002-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Estranged Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
