This film captures the original quartet in 1994 playing to a packed and frenzied crowd at the Venus de Milo in Boston. The band's workman like approach to their taunt, pummeling sound is contrasted by front man David Yow's Dionysian revelry as he whips himself and the crowd into an ecstatic mess. This 2-camera shoot catches all the blood, spit and sweat of a truly killer live band at their peak.","popularity":1.308,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mvd Visual","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One of the best live indie bands of the '90s performing at the Venus De Milo in Boston circa '94","title":"The Jesus Lizard: Live","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
