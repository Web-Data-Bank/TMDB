Frankenstein expert Russ Adams and radiation researcher Takako Mizuno are suspicious. Does this have anything to do with the radioactively mutated creature they raised years ago and that had been swallowed by an earthquake? Could a new being have developed from its cell remains, one that is so closely connected to nature in the depths of the sea, that it now regards humans as a natural enemy? A lively, experimantal mix between stage play, radio play and Japanese monster movie unfolds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aqxHPMcWGAzdl9nu5YgOB7pmo3X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2660,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neverhorst Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Frankenstein","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
