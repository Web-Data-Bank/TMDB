Her answer - ‘they were all lost in the flood’ - sparked this trip to meet the inhabitants of Westport, a small town just to the west of Columbus, Mississippi.  They reminisce about the great flood of the Tombigbee River in 1973, when some people lost everything. Many heirlooms and photos of the Eversons were swallowed up, and part of the family history disappeared.","popularity":1.447,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island of Saint Matthews","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
