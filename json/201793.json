From Washington to Watergate, yea verily from the Bering Straits to Baghdad, from New World to New World Order – The Complete History of America (abridged) is a ninety minute rollercoaster ride through the glorious quagmire that is American History, reminding us that it’s not the length of your history that matters – it’s what you’ve done with it!  The three cultural guerillas of the Reduced Shakespeare Company tackle such controversial questions as: Who really discovered America? Why did Abe Lincoln free the slaves? How many Democrats does it take to screw in a lightbulb? History is normally written by the winners… now it’s the RSC’s turn.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6ia8GZrnPuNXzBuoO1KnX0pKf3Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"History was written by the winners.
