This is not a film about the protests and debates wrapped up in religious views and political agenda, but rather a personal journey about one woman’s struggle to shed the stigma attached to the A-word in hopes of starting a dialogue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5C31pCbdzQYlEuR9kWfKQ9Otb7p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101762,"logo_path":null,"name":"USC School of Cinematic Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's easier said than done.","title":"The A-Word","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
