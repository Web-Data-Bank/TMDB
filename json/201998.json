He gets home, and his little boy scares him. To the title song, he teaches his son the basics of scare-crowing. Bedtime for junior; he prays to be a big scarecrow, just like his daddy. The next morning he sneaks out before anyone else is up and practices scaring a rooster, a squirrel, and a rabbit. He takes up his father's place, but the crows are not impressed; in fact, the crow goes on the attack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v8DzvcDYidFZfpEB7xf9cLrQaXz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1936-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'd Love to Take Orders from You","video":false,"vote_average":5.938,"vote_count":8}
