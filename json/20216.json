Hector's old buddy Merle has the perfect hideout/meth lab: an old, abandoned farmhouse in the woods where no one will ever find them. Unfortunately, no one will hear their screams either. Turns out, they may not be alone after all. It seems this farmhouse is the site of a horrific urban legend. Now, holed up together with nothing to do but snort, smoke and shoot up, the strung-out \"cookers\" fall prey to paranoia, private demons and terrifying visions which, whether they are hallucinations or hauntings, are equally terrifying and just as deadly!","popularity":2.3,"poster_path":"/x3rn9LruDwVx4P5YWV31hjFalVE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pacesetter Productions International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This Crystal Meth House Is Haunted","title":"Cookers","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":18}
