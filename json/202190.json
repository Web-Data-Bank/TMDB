Instead of obsessing on loss, she insists, one must accept it; at a certain age one must recognize the limits of human relationships and transfer one's attentions to nature.","popularity":0.93,"poster_path":"/kj9wv6xqs0CqBv56rpjfuO91ju2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Technisonor","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Break of Day","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
