They make up a primitive community which seeks to erase not only the distress created by the war but also the hardships of life, and look to protect themselves from violence, misery and fear. Amid the ruins of this post-war period, these men and women build a new rapport between themselves, between sexes, between generations, between social and geographical origins, between political camps.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zkCdEZcUe4JA5ofZYY7Q1DMGruN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":27124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pierre Grise Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":15261,"logo_path":"/wgKSrQW5yw07bT1TR0iTRO6FD2d.png","name":"Capricci Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":106168,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Comunale Francesco di Bartolo","origin_country":""},{"id":23983,"logo_path":"/mwdVAta6xcY8eCpL5t8KKc96BWm.png","name":"SR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2001-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Workers, Peasants","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":7}
