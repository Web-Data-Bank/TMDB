Lau (Andy Lau) is a fast-rising enforcer with the triads, but beneath his \"bad\" exterior is the sworn brother of Cheung (Cheung Kwok Keung), a Royal Hong Kong Police officer just returned from Scotland Yard. The two men are on opposite sides of the law, but both share a bond that cannot be tarnished, either by years or differing ideologies. Can the brotherhood of these two righteous men set things right in the underworld? Co-starring Tung Piu (Jackie Chan's Police Story films) in a compelling role as a corrupt cop, and loaded with many exciting actions sequences, Sworn Brothers is a standout triad action-drama in a genre already loaded with many similar films. With potent melodrama, and the type of heightened emotions that typify many popular eighties Hong Kong films, Sworn Brothers hits the action-drama bulls-eye in entertaining and bloody style!","popularity":3.006,"poster_path":"/g1LxLKOeYFQ5nIQxxLm5XwKkKkI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2521,"logo_path":"/e9lXexogBN1nOXA8axzASggea8B.png","name":"Orange Sky Golden Harvest","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":3106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bo Ho Films","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1987-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sworn Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
