The plot concerns struggles between peasants and the wealthy estate-owners over division of land in the early part of the 20th century. This battle is contrasted with the rivalry of two brothers over a woman's affections. The performances are somewhat lacking, but Georgiades' assured direction and presentation of a little-known chapter of Greek history resulted in an Oscar nomination as \"Best Foreign Film.\"","popularity":0.736,"poster_path":"/zDqPjR6ML2YCTvibDyCYe0zUto7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12093,"logo_path":"/a5l879HvnNElhZ5gxRWB5QVBuUp.png","name":"Finos Film","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":31084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Th.
