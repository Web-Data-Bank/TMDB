Writer/Director Dani Minnick has crafted a compassionate examination of the ragged edge of suburban life as characterized by Boyd, a charming, vulnerable and inveterate juvenile delinquent whose love nearly derails the life of a middle-class teenage girl. The understated themes of adolescent rebellion, adult responsibility and the redemptive power of love are woven elegantly into this dream-like film.","popularity":0.833,"poster_path":"/9jPLYwxOipzHTA3gRKDhbaToDQq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visionbox Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":86992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frozen Motion Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falling Like This","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
