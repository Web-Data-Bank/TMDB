The co-directors of 'Less Than Three', Nick Aucello and Joseph Lomas, acted in the film as themselves, two friends named Nick and Joe co-directing a short film, and the same holds true for many of the other positions in the cast and crew. While the awkward love triangle provides most of the films comedy, overall the film deals with more somber themes such as growing up, societal expectations, and the surrender of control.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Less Than Three","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
