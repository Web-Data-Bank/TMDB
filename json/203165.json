The entire first set was on fire, but the beginning of set two gives you a way to see Umphrey's like never before. Each member of the band is sporting a GoPro camera. You'll get a close up view of shredding guitar solos via Brenden and Jake's guitar cameras. You'll get bass slapping and head-banging via Stasik's head mounted GoPro. There's a combination of spacey and beautiful keyboard licks you'll see from the \"JoelPro,\" and you'll witness the heart of Umphrey's McGee beat through the chest-mounted cams worn by Andy and Kris as they power through \"1348\" and \"Day Nurse.\" What do you say Umphreaks, are you ready to join the band on stage?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Umphrey's McGee: The Tabernacle, Atlanta, GA 12/29/2012","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
