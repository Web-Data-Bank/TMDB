His journey takes us on another: that of his career, the ostracism with which he would be punished, his perpetual crusade for the materialization of “the idea”, his unique inspiration and incredible sense of humour. All emitted through his words and those of the people that surround him. An authentic pioneer, a free and cosmic spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6lhAgnHhj4lrik56MOzL1GuJH7H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195020,"logo_path":null,"name":"XiqueXique Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2009-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom Zé: Liberated Astronaut","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
