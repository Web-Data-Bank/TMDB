Some are led by the promise of Le Corbusier’s ideals. Upon arrival, a couple experiments the location, facilities, and space allotted to them. They each respond to the new habitat.

On board, settled cold, loneliness and sterility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iyrQazWlGqPdfHCI48QaM7lGDBe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Radiant Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":6}
