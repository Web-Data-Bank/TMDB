Amidst passionate supporters, they progressed to the finals with a wonderful blend of attacking football and tough defending. The unlucky Dutch, now lacking Cruyffs' sublime skills, were the fall guys once again in the Final, losing 3-1 in a classic clash of styles. This 1991 reedited version omits controversial interviews from the 1978 original \"Copa 78 - O Poder do Futebol\", while also including additional television footage of the tournament and newly dubbed English narration instead of the original Spanish.","popularity":1.02,"poster_path":"/hNGV3w9IB8ja6aw4cdE90DunLCi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Worldmark Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1978 FIFA World Cup Argentina: The Official Film","title":"Campeones","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":3}
