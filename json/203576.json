It did not disappoint its fans. France '98 was not short on drama or controversy, in equal measure and this is captured most effectively on this film. The 1998 film was shot on Super 16 mm film and includes the most complete and extensive coverage ever, with each match being filmed from more angles than any previous film.","popularity":1.151,"poster_path":"/iR4efK1A4NxzLBHELFx5VrvlT9f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Worldmark","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Coupe De La Gloire","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
