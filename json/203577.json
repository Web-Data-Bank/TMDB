It was the first World Cup in Asia and the first to be co-hosted by two countries. The official film captures the unique spirit of this event in 120 minutes of football - on the pitch and behind the scenes. This is one of few official films able to offer a hint of the world behind the dressing room door - Senegal's victory celebrations, Mexico's prayer and team talk and the referees debriefing.","popularity":1.653,"poster_path":"/k5xcQgxmA1yqrpeLcJAMfT9M55A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102852,"logo_path":null,"name":"TWI Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Games From Glory","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":3}
