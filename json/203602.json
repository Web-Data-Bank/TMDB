Upon arrival in Seattle, a sagacious mobster teaches them that it takes more than just a map to find Bruce's tomb, and something more than just a body to master the art of interpersonal communication. Will their relationship survive the mobster's grueling training? Will they be able to channel their enthusiasm towards a common dream? Seattle is a puzzle: will they find a frame pretty enough to hang it on the wall when it's all over?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9WOlNubJAtx869IhTI4HXNcoXT9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Towards Bruce Lee's Tomb","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
