They perform rituals that we fail to understand. When daylight comes, it only remains fragments.\r 'Until the Sacrifice of Giants' is a documentary fable about the disappearance of myths in contemporary society, through the observation of popular rites. The ritual is here treated as a fiction, a frame within which we are witnessing the end of an imaginary civilization.
