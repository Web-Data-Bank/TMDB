Inspired by the epic construction of the city of Brasília, the film uses this history to imagine it otherwise. \"I look at Brasília the way I look at Rome : Brasília began with a final simplification of ruins\". Through the geological traces that lead us to this fictive monument, the film unearths a history of exploration, prophecy and myth.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Age of Stone","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
