From this post, he was at the forefront of years of violence, border disputes, and the Palestinian liberation movement, all centering on neighboring Israel. Arafat signed a self-governing pact with Israel in 1991, at the Madrid Conference, and together with Israeli leaders made several attempts at lasting peace soon after, notably through the Oslo Accords (1993) and the Camp David Summit of 2000. Stemming from the Oslo Accords, Arafat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres shared the Nobel Peace Prize, but the terms were never implemented. Arafat ceded his PLO chairman post in 2003, and died in Paris in 2004.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biography: Yasser Arafat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
