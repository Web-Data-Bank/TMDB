However, it has happened throughout U.S. history. And long before gun control was positioned as a \"common sense measure\" to combat violence, it was used as a means to oppress certain minority groups. Presently, the growing trend in gun control favors the wealthy and privileged, who leverage their connections to ensure their Second Amendment rights and safety, while those of lesser means struggle. Informative and emotionally charged, \"Assaulted: Civil Rights Under Fire\" is an eye-opening look at the genesis of the Second Amendment to the Constitution, leading the audience to rethink the issues surrounding gun control, and the effect on civil rights and liberty. After all, what you don't know can kill you.","popularity":2.814,"poster_path":"/d6JJKek3ErEd6DamXYxIYaPAL8M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assaulted: Civil Rights Under Fire","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
