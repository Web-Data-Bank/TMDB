The classic Hollywood portrayals of pistol packin' mamas, tomboy sharp shooters, sexually twisted femme fatales, and high-heeled, cold-blooded assassins are caricatures. In truth, the typical woman who hangs out at rifle ranges and keeps ammo in her purse is the girl-next-door, the single mom, a hard working sister or aunt. Maybe she's a realist or has learned tough lessons from life; either way, she cares about her personal safety and may even find salvation, comfort or something satisfying in possessing a gun. In a word, she is empowered.  Breaking through the caricatures, A Girl and a Gun reveals America's diverse and far-ranging female gun community. It depicts how this community is portrayed by the media and targeted by the gun industry; and shows, through personal stories, how guns change women's lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Girl and a Gun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
