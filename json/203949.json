The tale begins at a garden party in a lovely villa in the Azores held by Rogerio and Leonor for handsome, middle-aged Michel and his mistress Irene, a noted Greek movie star. The guests aren't there long before an obvious attraction between Leonor and Michel prompts them to head for a private beach (their tryst, if there was one, occurs off-camera). Five years later, the foursome again meet for a garden party and once again they pair off after spending much time discussing gender differences, emotion, social insight and exchanging witty bon mots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nNaaPGklH663waXBA1lxVulPZxY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madragoa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1996-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Party","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
