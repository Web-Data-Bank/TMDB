The trouble begins when crotchety postman Andre begins complaining about his young neighbor Marianna's propensity for playing loud music every time she entertains a lover. To get back at him, Marianna begins sending him anonymous love letters. The old man is intrigued by the mysterious letters and hires a cheap detective to find their author. The detective is convinced the perpetrator is Teresita, a veteran hooker who joins in on the scheme to earn a little extra cash. Andre's friend and colleague tries to warn Andre that it is all a game, but his friend is in love and will not listen. Meanwhile, Marianna attempts to woo Luis Felipe, a hard, unfeeling tabloid journalist who has her take grisly pictures of murder victims for him. Both Marianna and Andre are destined to meet an unpleasant fate at the story's end.","popularity":0.614,"poster_path":"/na7RPhAPEeq0Z0VoBhqkgJRlIhr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sin remitente","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8}
