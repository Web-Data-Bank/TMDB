His malaise psychosomatically manifests itself in nosebleeds, outbursts of anger, visions, etc. One day, he sees a young Gypsy girl steal something from the store and lets it slide: he can't explain why, but she caught his eye. Pietro and Pabe – that's her name – warily start to hang out, knowing each other more and more, until something begins to blossom in them. Could their shared dream for a new, more compassionate life finally be at their fingertips?","popularity":1.647,"poster_path":"/lOToTOYUTp1JLBoKLPA5qnm7YQ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60870,"logo_path":null,"name":"PIC Films","origin_country":""},{"id":91021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mod films","origin_country":""},{"id":1242,"logo_path":"/qOvcm1WCLlAdNoQ1kCkk2J7bhWk.png","name":"Reteitalia","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":144456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Suisse de Radiodiffusion et Télévision (SSR)","origin_country":""},{"id":128352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radiotelevisione Svizzera Italiana (RTSI)","origin_country":""},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":146267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmförderung  Bern","origin_country":""},{"id":169023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aran","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1993-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Soul Split in Two","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
