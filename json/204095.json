But he puts up his street art for free. Have you ever wondered  what would happen if you got your hands on one of these?  Does it mean you’ve found a winning lottery ticket or just  scraped some worthless crap off a wall?  Going up against the Art Establishment, Critics, Auction Houses,  Gallery Owners and Authentication Boards in a quest for the  elusive meal ticket, two filmmakers unwittingly gatecrash the  murky and protective world of Banksy.  “HOW TO SELL A BANKSY” raises questions of ownership,  authentication and the true value of art itself. Through all the  chaos and incompetence comes a modern-day, true-story,  crime-theft, comedy-caper.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Sell a Banksy","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":10}
