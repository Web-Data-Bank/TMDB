The setting is changed to Spain, and Werther (Eusebio Poncela) has taken a job tutoring the son of an estranged husband and wife. The boy's mother is a surgeon and therefore a rather uncommon woman for her society. She and Werther gradually become romantically involved, and his feelings for her begin to run much deeper than is apparent on the surface.","popularity":0.9,"poster_path":"/nrF1pOUPgUJ1lQMTCPY5xYdqnow.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pilar Miró P.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1986-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Werther","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
