His death smites his wife, Elvira, who is unaware of the reasons for suicide. At another point, Ulises is assaulted and stripped of the portfolio that held the only photo he kept of her deceased daughter. He sets out to find the thief and kill him. The lives of Elvira and Ulises intersect unexpectedly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4f6eIT7KimcHFJvaa47zU3a6zn6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caverna Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2013-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las Búsquedas","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
