Trans-Dniestr) as a trip to a museum of communist totalitarianism. The country, whose independence has been recognized by only a few other states, remains an isolated multi-ethnic enclave held together by an authoritarian regime. In a country where you are only allowed to film out the window of a train, the locals are afraid of being denounced but are glad to live in a comfortable refuge from the hectic modern world, and songs on television celebrate the president.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vc082ZbYLrERpBU6aC4GxJc1rri.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20810,"logo_path":"/hBLCynl7e2l2w4Ro6SnS1a2FrME.png","name":"Nutprodukce","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2013-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary film about a country that doesn't exist","title":"Fortress","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
