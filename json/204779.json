The only things standing in the way are the Rock Jocks, a top-secret band of government employees, who pilot asteroid-killing satellites.  The story takes place during a Rock Jocks night shift. Though they are there to fight off asteroids, they spend most of the night fighting off boredom, themselves, and the occasional meddling government bureaucrat hell-bent on cutting their departmentâ€™s budget.","popularity":3.23,"poster_path":"/jIVFIccmZ6AKpfV9I9kzJApaZ7k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gamers.
