For these purposes, the movie tries to capture both the phenomenon of environmental displacement itself, and the problems of people affected by its consequences. Apart from theoretical considerations, it also examines which main factors force Bhola people to abandon their homes. Both long-term environmental hazards and short-lived natural disasters  are investigated here, and it is shown how they entail significant implications for the  dynamics of population mobility. Credited cast include: Katherine Jacobsen, Bogumil Terminski and Nancy Schneider","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eco Migrants: The Case of Bhola Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":1}
