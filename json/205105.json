Using voice-over narration, Falardeau presents a compelling analysis of the structure of wrestling and its rituals. The good guy against the evil antagonist, the forces of order and the desires of the crowd. ±  The audience becomes part of the spectacle in this powerful show where wrestlers confront one another under the watchful eye of the referee. It is a ritual of catharsis. The documentary begins with the words, images and sounds of Quebec's political struggle, \"SOS F.L.Q. Continuons le combat\". Produced right after the October Crisis in 1970, a crucial moment in Quebec's struggle to become a sovereign state, independent of Canada, the tape is charged with the bitter experience and political aspirations of the period. We recognize in this tape, the \"Falardeau style\" evident through a very strong narration that supports the images till the end, when the video abruptly closes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Continuous le Combat","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
