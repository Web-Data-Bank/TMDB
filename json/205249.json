He destroys Woody's bed with a drill and Woody plans to get even. First, he sticks a pan over said drill, then sticks his foot in the tree's branch and kicks the doctor in the face with it. He also inflates the doctor's stethoscope with a bellows until it explodes and holds up a sexy pin-up when the doctor x-rays the tree. Finally, Doc discovers Woody and gives chase but Woody inevitably outsmarts him knocking the doc unconscious. The pest gone, Woody can now continue his rest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cqdC3niywxVmPMvYmBx17PdOsAN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tree Medic","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
