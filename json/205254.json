Before he arrives, we tour the house and hear some evil-sounding cackles, which, it turns out, are coming from a radio one that a ghost was listening to. The ghost then sings the title song while getting ready for a night of haunting, just as Porky arrives. The ghost invites him in with a woman's voice, then disappears. Porky comes in and gets spooked by some flapping curtains. When he comes back in, the ghost puts a couple frogs into a pair of shoes and sets them loose; they collect a hatrack and a curtain, forming a sort of black ghost that ultimately scares Porky upstairs right into the arms of the ghost.","popularity":1.634,"poster_path":"/i7kWlYHTbsRb7wM2BnhVrxIoMgc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8298,"logo_path":"/r6cuEYq7DqrHCNVa7vSanTS0cuw.png","name":"Warner Bros.
