While flies drown in his mug of beer, he confronts a life of failure: the wife he ignored, the child he neglected, the teaching duties he has shirked, and his doomed efforts at winning tenure from school officials. Only a dream from the past-the memory of a former liaison with a film star with whom he shared \"the Andechs feeling, a feeling that we are not alone\" - provides sustenance. Despite an unexpected series of events, longing in Achternbusch's world ultimately remains stronger than fulfilment and thirst better than beer.","popularity":0.822,"poster_path":"/iBAvRuX78T4JAdLo4KY4ImLad4K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neue Bioskop Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Andechser Gefühl","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
