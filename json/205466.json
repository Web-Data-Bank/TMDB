Impatient over the rental agency restricting the ship’s speed to 10x, Devin and the others convince Shaun to remove the craft’s constrictor device. Doing so damages the computer’s automated systems, as well as the ability to send a distress beacon, causing the six friends to crash land on an uncharted alien planet.","popularity":4.055,"poster_path":"/yhHj7lfIQK4gqMt1CsnvfZIoLbW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Automatic Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Marooned on a remote planet, only one thing is certain... they are not alone.","title":"Dark Space","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":26}
