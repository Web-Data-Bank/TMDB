At first, the short, pointy-nosed astronomer at the observatory zooms his huge telescope into the panther's window and believes the newspaper photo of a sexy woman being looked upon by the panther is an actual observation of life on the Moon, and he telephones the fantastic finding to his employers. The Pink Panther builds a brick wall to block the telescope's view, and the hostilities begin.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/5FRW9YbrXsyE77uUvv8dPdhVBE6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8402,"logo_path":null,"name":"DePatie-Freleng Enterprises","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Pink","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
