Fortini, an Italian Jew, reads excerpts from the book about his alienation from Judaism and from the social relations around him, the rise of Fascism in Italy, the anti-Arab attitude of European culture. The images, mostly a series of Italian landscape shots, provide a backdrop that highlights the meaning of the text. - Fabrizio Sabidussi","popularity":0.637,"poster_path":"/qHHI5DegpKyImK4NJf2XxQ92Use.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Straub-Huillet","origin_country":""},{"id":11895,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artificial Eye","origin_country":""},{"id":5448,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Yorker Films","origin_country":""},{"id":17763,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunchild Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":66210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polytel International Film","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fortini/Cani","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":9}
