One of the bestselling albums of all time, RUMOURS' impeccable songwriting, lush vocal harmonies, and polished production stand as testament to the band's cohesive powers--a fact made even more remarkable by the romantic tensions roiling amongst its members at the time (Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were ending their long-term romantic relationship; Christine and John McVie were getting a divorce). This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series recounts the making of Fleetwood Mac's career-making opus through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and live performances of timeless gems such as \"Don't Stop,\" \"Dreams,\"\"Go Your Own Way,\" \"You Make Loving Fun,\" \"The Chain,\" and more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/slxL55DHNtGBSeol4jpbyoTfGpZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Classic Albums","title":"Classic Albums: Fleetwood Mac - Rumours","video":false,"vote_average":6.375,"vote_count":8}
