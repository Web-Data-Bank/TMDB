The story is based on real-life events, an Eastern European circus artist family that fled to the West. If they want to stay in the circus business they have to make up an exotic act. The mother spends all their money to buy a very dangerous act: hanging by her hair high up in the dome of the circus while juggling with burning torches. Every night Aglaja is terrified by the fear of losing her mother. But, on some day, she has to follow the family tradition and become the \"Woman with the Hair of Steel\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AuLshLBeAfu3MPbmAEH72cd9UrG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6477,"logo_path":"/tn6i5FOfcfCrYR3zviZVvYdolwu.png","name":"Opus Film","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":11007,"logo_path":"/irlUVryOnJuz7iD5K7cy1bdQH4e.png","name":"Inforg Studio","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":59514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hai Hui Entertainement","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2012-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aglaya","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
