He was a human being in animal guise. The story begins in RÃ© Valley, which lies like a yawning gap between mountains, long and flat with borders of forests so dark that they look as though part of the blackness of night lingered in them. A river moves sluggishly along the bottom of the valley, making its way slowly and carefully between stretches of light-red sand. It runs northwards, a rare thing in Norway.","popularity":0.781,"poster_path":"/jiIB3in5FAtN4XukXHHIk2jt0ha.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1927-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Troll-Elgen","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7}
