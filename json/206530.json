John (Bryan Brown) is a veteran insurance investigator who succumbs to temptation and veers towards the wrong side of the law. With the help of novice con man Ben (Tom Long), John hatches a scheme to substantiate false claims by taking a percentage of several questionable claims his firm has settled for a fraction of their usual worth. John and Ben are assisted in their illegal business by Louise (Claudia Karvan), a lawyer with a cocaine problem who is also John's lover. But when Louise becomes involved with Ben and demands a bigger share of the money, their already-shaky confidence game begins to collapse.","popularity":1.652,"poster_path":"/eI4r8UWA0kx2mdHh08ItsEp3B5f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36082,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Premiere Movie Partnership","origin_country":""},{"id":36083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Macgowan and Beneficiary Films","origin_country":""},{"id":27207,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smiley Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":418,"logo_path":null,"name":"New South Wales Film \u0026 Television Office","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2001-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's the quiet ones you have to watch.","title":"Risk","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6}
