Why did the roommate Herman replaced leave all of his stuff behind, as though he never really left? And why do the rest of the roommates \"assume\" he joined a cult? And why is there a makeshift tombstone with his name on it in the backyard? And what's the deal with the monster that's stealing Herman's socks and living in a giant labyrinth under the house? As Herman searches for the answers he'll learn that they can only be found on a path that leads to sex, murderous murder, hole-digging, and a BATTLE TO THE DEATH!","popularity":1.58,"poster_path":"/2WFvSyzpJHX6IbxBhezOxoHoZRQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazing Schlock Film Factory","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Murder...
