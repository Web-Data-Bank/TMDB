This experience formed the basis for her book La condition ouvrière. The written chronicle of her days is visually accompanied by a continuous flow of dark rooms and the urban landscape of Île Seguin (suburbs south of Paris), paying particular attention to construction sites and factories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Je suis Simone (La condition ouvrière)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
