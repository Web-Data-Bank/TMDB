Adam Miauczynski, the character known from director Marek Koterski's previous films, is a 44 year-old teacher, who reads poetry during school lessons and later goes home swearing and calling his neighbours' names. The worst pain for him is the next 5 minutes of living. He doesn't accept himself and even everyday contacts with others cause his aggression. Though constantly dreaming of a romantic love, he is not bold enough to make his dreams come true. The desperate Miauczynski personalizes our own fears and obsessions, which have become so visible recently.","popularity":5.542,"poster_path":"/kzoPSY2VAbIChz3uiU6VO8uCmpH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Zebra","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":86742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vision Film","origin_country":""},{"id":72701,"logo_path":null,"name":"Non Stop Film Service","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2002-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day of the Wacko","video":false,"vote_average":7.594,"vote_count":160}
