While all three characters are too reticent to unleash their feelings, the romance turns on the realization that this web of emotions is largely symbolic. Nham represents for Quyen an innocence and a past that she can’t recapture, just as she represents for Nham an urbanity and future prospects that he may never attain; and caught between the two is the delicate Ngu, left in the most desolate postion of positions.","popularity":0.775,"poster_path":"/zvfq6vqnmx4rL139BiPduJvjeYM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hodafilm","origin_country":""},{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nostalgia for the Countryside","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5}
