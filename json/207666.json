The unusual yet beautiful setting is the historic interior of the Bowery Savings Building/Cipriani 42nd Street; one can see an occasional car flash by through windows behind Harry Connick Jr. and his Big Band. Connick's program includes holiday standards but his arrangements are novel, cutting against the melodiousness of the likes of \"Silver Bells\" or \"Frosty the Snowman\" with edgy strings, sizzling brass, and complex rhythms. \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" and \"The Happy Elf\" swing like nobody's business, while \"Silent Night\" shifts from blues to ballad to gospel in a collaboration between Connick, Marc Anthony, and Kim Burrell. Whoopi Goldberg and Nathan Lane turn up for some cute sketches, and there's a bonus: Connick and Burrell doing the lovely \"I Pray on Christmas,\" not seen in the NBC broadcast.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a1yE50xuDVLr3v2n2lg8QG2QM21.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harry Connick, Jr.:  Harry For The Holidays","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
