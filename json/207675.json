These events culminated in three devaluations of the peso in 1982 and the famous nationalization of Mexico's private banking system under the presidency of José López Portillo.  -Edgar Cochran-","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Detalle Films","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1982: La Decisión del Presidente","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
