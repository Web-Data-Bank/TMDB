The viper is deaf and the scorpion can't see, so it is and so shall be, the same way the countryside is peaceful and the city bustling and the human being impossible to satisfy. Lacrau demands the return \"to the curve where man got lost\" in a journey from the city towards nature. The escape from chaos and emotional void we call progress; matter without spirit, without will. The search for the most ancient sensations and relationships of mankind. The amazement, the fear of the unknown, the loss of basic comforts, loneliness, the meeting with the other, the other animal, the other vegetable. A dive looking for a connection with the world. Where beginning and end are the same, but I am not.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/39kqmiGLMxWvbjCAg6yJGablumj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2013-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lacrau","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
