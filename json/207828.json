Trixie Friganza performs first a story and then a song. For the story, she wears a wide-brimmed had and a matching diaphanous shawl. She tells of a visit to a friend who has a five-year old son. The mother tells Trixie a tale of stepping out on her husband, and to conceal the story from the boy, spells out key words. By the story's end, mom is in for a surprise and Trixie has a moral for us. Then, the hat and shawl come off, a base fiddle comes out, and Trixie sings us a comic song about her first two husbands.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oFpVh80K6fOfGimdtizp9MPbTBf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Bag o' Tricks","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
