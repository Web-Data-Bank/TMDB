Ward navigates the change of early 20th century America on the wrong side of the law and society, his long-time friend, a freed slave named Christmas Moultrie, at his side. Master of Shakespeare, and the shotgun that provides Savannah's markets with fowl, Ward fights for his rights as a hunter. His charisma and eloquent rhetoric win the heart of a society woman who defies her father to marry him. An elderly Moultrie tells the story of life on the river with his friend to a little boy, who passes the legendary Ward Allen down to the next generation.","popularity":3.912,"poster_path":"/6MAuG6SU0yTIvCweElDNBXcofwQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Meddin Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":31142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unclaimed Freight Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Savannah","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":24}
