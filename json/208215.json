The resulting cacophonic sound evokes noise music and the destruction of instruments at rock concerts and in Fluxus performances. The work refers more precisely to a racist murder committed in 1998 not far from the film location - James Byrd Jr. an African American, was dragged by a truck for several kilometers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guitar Drag","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
