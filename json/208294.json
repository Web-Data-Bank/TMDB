These are the last days of the Button Queen, the drugstore owner, the butcher and the fine leather–goods dealer. Yet this quaint picture is soon shattered by stories and gestures marked by the disruptions of History, social violence and disappointment, behind the jumble of goods and obsessive tidying up.  OUT OF TIME lovingly portrays four jewels of their trades. Silently observed by the camera, it’s a tale of the walls encompassing their lives, of their memories, relationships and desires, of loneliness and letting go, of love, and of new hope.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
