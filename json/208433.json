When she wakes, she finds in her pocket a strange Polaroid of herself with a mysterious man. This brush with the unknown draws her away from home and inexorably down a rabbit hole peopled with urchins, dealers, and a host of characters that the rest of the world has forgotten. For Cassie every choice leads her closer to the strangers in the picture - not only the man whose name is whispered among vagrants, but the woman she thought she knew as well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Whatever Symbol You Need","title":"Frogtown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
