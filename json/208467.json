This extraordinary work of art, in two different but interlocking and complementary formats, defies easy categorization. For in this multi-layered opus of poetic symbolism, photographer Bettina Rheims and writer Serge Bramly evoke the City of Light in a completely novel way: this is a Paris of surrealist visions, confused identities, artistic phantoms, unseen manipulation, obsession, fetish, and seething desire.","popularity":1.804,"poster_path":"/1xYeJ3gSHvRok61nzqaJzDi3FmS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25216,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Campagne Première","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rose, c'est Paris","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6}
