At a royal hunting lodge there, in 1889, Crown Prince Rudolf--desperate over his father's command to put away his teenage mistress, the Baroness Marie Vetsera--shot her to death and killed himself. The misfortune may indeed have been a murder-suicide, but perhaps it was a political assassination, or even the result of a lunatic family vendetta: scholarship is still catching up with the facts.","popularity":1.361,"poster_path":"/jTp66gtnIv5dMJD4qwoiaXQ8pRF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showcase Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mayerling","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
