He will stop at nothing to defeat all challengers - until, in an tragic accident, he kills a fellow competitor and is sent to prison. Eight years later, Yue Feng emerges a changed man. He no longer fights, and is looking for a new life of peace and fulfillment. But it's brutal on the streets, and redemption doesn't come easy. His brotherhood is destroyed, family members murdered, and a loved one humiliated - a deadly chain reaction that leaves him no choice but to unleash his power in the name of justice.","popularity":2.324,"poster_path":"/tYAZH5MfwGxXrAwZdtgnxEiv3cT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pegasus Motion Pictures","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2012-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The King of the Streets","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":16}
