Twenty years later the Brazilian mathematician Euclides continues his research. The lack of an essential component won't allow a breakthrough. Only AUN, Sekai's son, seems to hold the key to protect mankind from self-destruction. In the aftermath of the nuclear tragedy in Fukushima the film appears like a prophecy. AUN's dream-like images, complemented by music from Christian Fennesz and Ryuichi Sakamoto, lead into a fantastic and exciting world, full of brightness and darkness of life.","popularity":1.309,"poster_path":"/r44tipizNQAQE4KqglqFwnMdIAA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175791,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edoko Institute Vienna","origin_country":""},{"id":175792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ribo Ltd.
