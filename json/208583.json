They hesitate on the idea at first but agree eventually for the sum of money they will be paid in exchange for selling the rights to the material. When the finished film is finally shown in theaters, they proceed to the city all the way from their hometown to catch the screening. They are elated at the prospect of seeing the larger-than-life versions of themselves. But as the motion picture gradually unfolds before their very eyes, they instead go through another harrowing experience of a lifetime.","popularity":0.966,"poster_path":"/8n7SUR29ea62Wnp2oumHmByw9Hm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Available Light","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":8238,"logo_path":"/3f3SS3sep9V3Nf7RAxNd5UUEw1E.png","name":"Regal Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2001-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Larger than Life","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
