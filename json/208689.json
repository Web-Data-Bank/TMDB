This quietly outrageous film begins with the high-toned Heywood Choir singing \"Watermelon time\" and concludes with Amon David playing a preacher using heavy blackface. Amon Davus was known as \"the Back Biting Comedian, Par Excellence\", and his sermon is one of Michaeux's many notable send-ups of the clergy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dYoTWcuBveIrU72q8oWw0UwfFSX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Micheaux Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Darktown Revue","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":4}
