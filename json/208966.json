Thanks to 3D visualization, large audiences can experience a chameleon thrusting out its tongue at close range, rattle- snakes striking at their targets to within fractions of an inch, praying mantises hunting and hummingbirds feeding, filmed from inside the flower! And with its ingenious combination of slow-motion 3D and timelapse 3D, “Little Monsters” even improves upon state of the art 3D for greater impact, yielding unbelievable scenes the world has never seen and “felt” before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qPygZWQchFNQNikkPE1iyDmfduq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Monsters 3D","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
