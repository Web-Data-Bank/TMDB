Combining archive footage with a series of intimate interviews conducted with Devlin McAliskey, director Lelia Doolan perfectly encapsulates the idiosyncrasies and rebelliousness which has fuelled her subject’s pivotal role at the heart of civil rights, feminism and socialism in Northern Ireland. Bernadette is a fascinating and powerful account of this firebrand figure, an impressively rounded depiction of a woman blessed with incredible eloquence, clarity and firm socialist principles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/25luUAeHCiMX1rOZQW4mT9LjmUv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bernadette: Notes on a Political Journey","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
