Today, only three nuns remain - their legacy on the river is coming to an end. This is a complex world of powerful dualities; Maori &amp; Christian spirituality, parties &amp; prayers, pig hunting and perfume appreciation...  Over the course of a year, the film follows the journey of Sister Margaret Mary, the newest Sister to Jerusalem, who is a regular volunteer at the local school. Through an intimate, observational gaze, the film is captivated by the spellbinding personalities of the local kids, whose humour and unique philosophies transcend the harsher realities of life.  Throughout all seasons, the Sisters’ daily practice of compassion engages with the traditions of local Maori. Together they must learn to navigate lifeʼs heartbreak and joy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jerusalem.
