As his explosive temper quickly finds him enemies in both prison authorities and fellow inmates — and his already volatile relationship with his father is pushed past breaking point — Eric is approached by a volunteer psychotherapist, who runs an anger management group for prisoners. Torn between gang politics, prison corruption, and a glimmer of something better, Eric finds himself in a fight for his own life, unsure if his own father is there to protect him or join in punishing him.","popularity":10.295,"poster_path":"/e1DRGfyRxYQclvJOJiXwAw5gDg2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4186,"logo_path":"/uy7JxbrNdjxv4DqBmdh8oh1JFav.png","name":"Quickfire Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":322,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sigma Films Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":9987,"logo_path":"/o5OTKAw7Acl5fTZYPyl8M8D9570.png","name":"Lipsync Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/e8EXNSfwr5E9d3TR8dHKbQnQK4W.png","name":"Film4 Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8087,"logo_path":"/54EcBNvIolJDr4OHFACvTHJK2Q0.png","name":"Creative Scotland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":11667,"logo_path":"/dhBJdstAolGmqRfbQfElhsU1cTo.png","name":"Northern Ireland Screen","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-03-21","revenue":54915,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We're all different on the inside.","title":"Starred Up","video":false,"vote_average":7.101,"vote_count":847}
