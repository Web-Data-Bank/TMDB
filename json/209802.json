The tales showcase an ensemble of familiar faces, and range from stories of compassion and love to reflections on violence and loss. Among them: a disabled beggar quarrels with a woman and ruins her shoes with his wheelchair, provoking onlookers to wrath and pity; a skittish tourist proves to be her own worst enemy; a newlywed trysts with a mysterious sexpot; a commuter helplessly witnesses a suicide attempt; and, in the most affecting segment, a young woman grieves over her mother's imminent death.","popularity":0.927,"poster_path":"/elvkFrPPZfWv7MYm2MBmDe0t5N2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1274,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clinica Estetico","origin_country":""},{"id":73059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ten in a Car Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7429,"logo_path":"/6in9uMqxXEHx5XgYgkeRBpZ4rPw.png","name":"HBO Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Subway Stories: Tales from the Underground","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
