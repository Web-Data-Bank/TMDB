Within a colourless city of walls, corridors, and small rooms, a man makes his way from home to work, then to a bar, and then, by a stroke of luck, into an outdoors of space, fresh air, and colour. Along the way, he changes his face to fit his surroundings, interacts with his dog, argues with co-workers, and gossips at a bar. His altering of his visage suggests a two-faced nature, and his stepping into the outdoors provides the ultimate test of his real identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9RzNNJxAuHGrAf4kw35lZ1Ry5mM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":297,"logo_path":"/58TnhYZqbMYgkHM6lg7dJoYJ4RH.png","name":"Aardman","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ident","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
