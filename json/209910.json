Beauty, weightlessness, mystery and art were key aspects of the concept. The objective was to mix the elements of fire and water.\r It was intended to create strong contrasts. On one side the deity had to have the beauty, femininity and delicacy of a seahorse and on the other side the strength and evilness of a dragon.  In ancient Greek mythology, Amphitrite was a sea-goddess and wife of Poseidon. Under the influence of the Olympian pantheon, she became merely the consort of Poseidon, and was further diminished by poets to a symbolic representation of the sea. The clip shows the invocation of the goddess.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amphitrite - Underwater Goddess","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
