She chooses an elderly, homeless ex-con (Mickey Rooney) as her pseudo-grandfather and he teaches her - and her family -\r the true meaning of Christmas.\r Somewhat predictable..  but has a good plot twist about half way through that keeps it interesting.\r A solid, low-key performance by Mickey Rooney as the seemingly broken down homeless man saves this one from drowning in it's own mushiness.","popularity":0.683,"poster_path":"/2ec2AkGUx0mp6xJOoOJGbwvwUbI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68700,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dandelion-Visual Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1990-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let Him Steal Your Heart.","title":"Home for Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":6}
