A boy whose father is a pilot imagines that his toy plane becomes the real thing, allowing him to fly side-by-side through the heavens with his father. He takes off from a tree house overlooking the sea and his father's landing strip. Their flight is graceful and full of adventure. Then, we watch the boy grow, study, marry, father a child, and become, himself, a grandfather. Holding a toy plane, he takes his grandchild to the same cliff from whence his own imagination took off years before.","popularity":0.67,"poster_path":"/x7kryIOrjkzVxkfgMeMcw6f2YL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12189,"logo_path":"/1ictacTW028ZDtea9GqYWnIR8aJ.png","name":"La Boîte, ...
