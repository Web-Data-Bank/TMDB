But rather than sell themselves, the girls rob and murder their guests, hording a growing pile of gold for a rainy day.  In their latest haul, however, the women discover the bound and desperate Linh Lan (Tang Thanh Ha) hidden in a coffin. She begs them to spare her life and train her in martial arts, so she can kill evil general Quan Du, who murdered her family. Kieu Thi agrees, and takes Linh Lan under her wing, but it soon transpires not everyone is who they originally claimed to be.","popularity":1.911,"poster_path":"/uKJAbzBxBkbkklSxMlTp3PaNnsn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2013-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lady Assassin","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":10}
