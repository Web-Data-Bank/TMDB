Krzysztof Krauze's biopic My Nikifor travels to the tail end of Krynicki's (Krystyna Feldman) life journey, dramatizing the period that surrounded his interaction with the well-established artist Marian Wlosinski (Roman Gancarczyk).","popularity":0.752,"poster_path":"/9hrc3d96gwuiPNO6BEgR5KtVShY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agencja Produkcji Filmowej","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":58225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Zebra","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":250,"logo_path":"/evWKasiElVQywuKv2dI72P9twz8.png","name":"Canal+ Polska","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2004-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Nikifor","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":13}
