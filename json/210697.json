But beside these scenes of glorious misrule gathers a nationwide rebellion led by the Duke of Northumberland and his charismatic son, Hotspur. The first installment of Shakespeare's gripping account of the rise of Hal from idle barfly to monarch-in-waiting combines compelling power politics with the hilarious antics of Falstaff, Shakespeare's greatest comic creation.","popularity":1.544,"poster_path":"/en4wPjHBPQC05ylRBT2pjNHu75u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakespeare's Globe","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Henry IV, Part 1 - Live at Shakespeare's Globe","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
