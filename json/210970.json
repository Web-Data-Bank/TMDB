They are together. They are building their happiness. Not in ‘another way’. In the same way. Polish gays and lesbians living in permanent relationships do not confirm the stereotype of life filled with hundreds of sexual partners. Faithfulness and normality are the most important for them although the reality they live in does not make their every day existence easier. Homo.pl is a warm portrait without pity or a  patronizing approach. ‘They’ are some of ‘us’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homo.pl","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
