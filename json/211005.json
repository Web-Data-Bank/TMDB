Their friendship, forged by being outsiders in a conformist country, took them through years of adulation and success, with slight detours into the welcoming arms of vilification and imprisonment. A joyride through taxation, mass travel, hookers and politics. Not feeling too constrained by historical facts, director Christoffer Boe's story of Simon Spies and Mogens Glistrup covers just a few of their decades in a tale of warmth and humour, defiance and eccentricity.","popularity":1.97,"poster_path":"/f1aHVJQKflibJQhjCN8jZCobLyW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40938,"logo_path":null,"name":"AlphaVille Pictures Copenhagen","origin_country":""},{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2013-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex, Drugs & Taxation","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":27}
