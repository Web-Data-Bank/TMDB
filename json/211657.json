Wreath, a 24 year old mama's boy, is forced to leave his house to find a job by his mother. In this effort to find employment, he accidentally hits the first trace of zombie in the apocalypse, a zombified girl by the name of Sarah . Wreath takes care of the zombie in secret whilst feeding it and eventually falling in love with it in his garage. In a different light, a trio consisting of a girl named Stella and her two contesting love interests, Josh and Brendan find themselves trapped in a provincial park amidst the zombie invasion, struggling for survival. And last but not least, two stoners, Carl and Reggie venture on a vacation up a mountain to escape the looming apocalypse only to find themselves on the trail of a strangely agile zombie clown who will stop at nothing to devour the brains of them both.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-10","revenue":1200,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They'll tear you a new one.","title":"Roaming Hungry","video":false,"vote_average":9.8,"vote_count":2}
