The voice of the photographer, speaking of his choices and memories, and a montage of sound archives seem to comment on the photographs, which several film archives put into context. A sober and fascinating presentation of the work of a great artist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":149663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agence Rapho","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robert Doisneau, tout simplement","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
