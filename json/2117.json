Dedicated expressly to the downfall of the monolithic Third Reich war machine, they call themselves the White Rose. One of its few female members, Sophie Scholl is captured during a dangerous mission to distribute pamphlets on campus with her brother Hans. Unwavering in her convictions and loyalty to the White Rose, her cross-examination by the Gestapo quickly escalates into a searing test of wills as Scholl delivers a passionate call to freedom and personal responsibility.","popularity":10.322,"poster_path":"/84HWRlRwpOjZ4cYlmFZjDGyvB5q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldkind Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":50286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broth Film","origin_country":""},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of a young woman who did what few in Nazi Germany dared even think!","title":"Sophie Scholl: The Final Days","video":false,"vote_average":7.173,"vote_count":373}
