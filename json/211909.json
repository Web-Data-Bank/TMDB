Events overtake Subbaiah Sastry, a highly respected vedic and scholar in his prime now scraping out a meagre existence as a corpse carrier. He endures the contempt of his Hyderabad neighbours due to his acceptance of Tiladaanam, a lowly Brahammic rite involving the acceptance of the sins of the dead in exchange for coins and the food of the deceased. His son, Raghuram, has become a terrorist hunted by the police, at odds with his father. A stark contrast is provided between an outdated system and as yet undefined future. - Melbourne International Film Festival","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p4b04vWfkhFUHaXV99OibaLm7u6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development Corporation of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Telugu","iso_639_1":"te","name":"తెలుగు"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rite, a Passion","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
