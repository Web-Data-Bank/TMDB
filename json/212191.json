Corbijn shot the iconic cover artwork for U2's The Joshua Tree and Depeche Mode's 101, and gave both groups a new and more dramatic visual persona in the process. Since them, Corbijn's work, bearing his trademark dark shadows and deep, textural details, has graced the covers of recordings by R.E.M., Bruce Springsteen, Morrissey, Nick Cave, John Lee Hooker and even Bon Jovi. Corbijn has also directed a number of music videos for the likes of Nirvana, Johnny Cash and Metallica, and made his debut as a feature film director in 2007 with Control, a screen biography of Ian Curtis of Joy Division (who Corbijn photographed several times in the group's heyday). In Shadow Play: The Making of Anton Corbijn, filmmaker Josh Whiteman offers an intimate look at the life and career of this celebrated visual artist, featuring interviews with Bono, Chris Martin, Michael Stipe, Dave Gahan and Bernard Sumner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zgXtxsQ51n44Y6ExHNf7AU2HbxG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow Play: The Making of Anton Corbijn","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
