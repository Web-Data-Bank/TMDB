After three jail sentences (under two different names), aged 70 and suffering from terminal cancer, he announced his return to music. We follow a gun-toting McGill and his fiance Joyce through four states as he steals whatever's not nailed down and charms his way into and out of trouble. But when you point a camera at a man who will do anything for notoriety, how responsible are you when he goes too far?","popularity":0.844,"poster_path":"/cQTh0QiNRiqr7TQOxLmK68QF415.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Very Extremely Dangerous","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
