Except life is anything but sweet for Jan (Kai Wiesinger), whose attempts to modernize an old luxury hotel in Italy are thwarted by the local competition’s mafia-like methods. Fortunately, help is at hand in the shapely form of Maria (Liane Forestieri), a German-Italian who originally came to fetch her young son. Together, they get the job done and, this being a romantic comedy, fall in love just as marketing director Susanne, who also happens to be Jans’ girlfriend, arrives to inspect the work. Her suspicions are soon aroused.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zxxWTJ1cxGsN7IqQpleWeV5Vgpj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2049,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaminski.Stiehm.Film GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":1478,"logo_path":"/plHEkpGkULYqiLRpYsUak8uYmhU.png","name":"Sat.1","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Weeks In Italy","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
