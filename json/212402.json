It is also where Roscoe Driggers hangs out. Roscoe claims to be the world's champion cornet player, although he can't play a note, even a sour one. But when the chance to earn $500 for playing his cornet at the big concert held by the \"Over the River Burying Society\" arises, Roscoe signs up. Roscoe needs $500 in order to buy a beauty shop for his manicurist-fianc√©e, Zenia Sprowl. Roscoe makes plans for his buddy Sam Ginn, who can play a cornet, to hide under the stage and play while Roscoe fakes it on the stage. But Sam gets taken out by some dudes who have a bone to pick with Roscoe. No sweat, though, as another of Roscoe's musician friends, Willie Trout, sees this and takes Sam's place under the stage....with his saxophone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music Hath Harms","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
