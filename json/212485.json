The exhibition, at the Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver, Canada, featured 48 large-format color photographic prints of clothing once worn by those who perished in the atomic bomb, taken by renowned Japanese photographer Ishiuchi Miyako. Ishiuchi brought the garments--still colorful and fashionable nearly seven decades later--out of permanent storage at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial archive and photographed them in the light, to trace the spirits of those who once wore them. The photographs, exhibited without any identifying caption, mutely solicited viewers to imagine or divulge a narrative, and unlocked a wealth of secrets and memories from those who encountered them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things Left Behind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
