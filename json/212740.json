Doña Tere has a traditional Mexican restaurant called \"El Molcajete\". After the death of her daughter, Doña Tere abandoned his passion for cooking and stopped working in \"El Molcajete\", now operating under the direction of chef Rosi. Maria does everything possible to bring her grandmother back to the restaurant, while chef Rosi cooks dishes according to new trends in fusion cuisine which highlights the light food, but Maria and Doña Tere won't accept the traditional flavors and cooking secrets to be forgotten.
