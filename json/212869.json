Both of them putting all their effort into getting the one man. This will inevitable lead to all sorts of mischief, crime and even a murder.  This murder-comedy, shot at the dawn of normalization has intentionally broke off from any connection to the reality of its time. The director Zdeněk Podskalský has focused on creating  intriguing story lines, revolving around the two endeavouring female characters who are fighting for the same man. Two competing parties are not only ready to kill the other, but also (if necessary) the potential groom.  This film has enabled the members of the cast, composed mainly of the brightest stars of the Czech acting scene of that time, to show an incredible acting range, from the lightest comedy to the darkest cynical morbidity.","popularity":0.844,"poster_path":"/zNjbuJihxp2Rur0vDYubDu9zjiv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1931,"logo_path":"/5erHhgvym2cTORao8ajtn2gbiTH.png","name":"Filmové studio Barrandov","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1970-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devilish Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
