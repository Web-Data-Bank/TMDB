The film follows a police investigation into four murders and charts the doomed romance of the outlaw lovers. A deeply romantic, elegiac and universal crime story where the murders are not the point of the movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Durban Poison","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
