Using state-of-the-art scalar engines to fly around the Moon and back in just hours, the maiden voyage of the first-ever trans-lunar passenger ship is about to make history. Among those on board: First Lady Simone Mathany, space-exploration entrepreneur Steve Roebling, Dr. Denise Balaban, pilot Fiona Henslaw, and a very lucky lottery winner.

Now out of control, it’s hurtling straight for the sun.","popularity":5.824,"poster_path":"/f69MoJZkvXJGa80rLC33SwCHTDp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6438,"logo_path":"/hQVRii7CRnfG0rowSEc6ibt2Pke.png","name":"Muse Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":174,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A historic space launch triggers a solar-storm event that could have cataclysmic repercussions for the planet if it isn’t stopped in time—and time is running out.","title":"Exploding Sun","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":30}
