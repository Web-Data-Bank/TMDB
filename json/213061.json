It tells the story of how a nation, still healing from the 1994 genocide, creates a film industry as both an outlet for the pain and a way to bring entertainment and a new industry to the population. Hillywood, which is named for Rwanda’s hilly terrain, is a traveling film festival that screens films made by, about, and for Rwandans. The festival goes from town to town, setting up public, outdoor screenings, on inflatable screens, to showcase Rwandan films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RW","name":"Rwanda"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kinyarwanda","iso_639_1":"rw","name":"Kinyarwanda"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Power Of Film To Heal","title":"Finding Hillywood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
