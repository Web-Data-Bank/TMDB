Lembra-me","overview":"Joaquim Pinto has been living with HIV and VHC for almost twenty years. “What now? Remind Me” is the notebook of a year of clinical studies with toxic, mind altering drugs as yet unapproved. An open and eclectic reflection on time and memory, on epidemics and globalization, on survival beyond all expectations, on dissent and absolute love. In a to-and-fro between present and past memories, the film is also a tribute to friends departed and those who remain.","popularity":1.209,"poster_path":"/g5cJN2U5lZnO77TjVdH22pOzpFj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8681,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.R.I.M.
