Here it is! John Deere Earth Mover Action 2 has them all - excavators, dozers, graders, wheel loaders, and more.  We visit the John Deere Demonstration Grounds in Moline, Illinois where expert operators put John Deere's big machines to the test. Excavators dig deep and load huge dump trucks, dozers push giant piles of dirt, graders level the ground on steep slopes, and loaders lift bucketfuls of dirt high into the air. The action includes skid steers, compactors, and backhoes, too. Then it's off to the forests to the Northwest where we see tree harvesting equipment in action - feller bunchers, skidders, knuckle boom loaders, and harvesters.  Non-stop big machine action.
