Miguel Malvar in the Philippine-American War, the people of a Batangue√±o town would have lost its character typified by the Tagalog term \"barako\", meaning brave or courageous. Much worse, they have become subservient to their corrupt leaders who have been taking advantage of their ignorance and poverty.
