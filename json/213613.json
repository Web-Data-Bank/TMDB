Shades of difference between Islam's foundation and that of its counterparts prove more fascinating than divisive, e.g., Islam claims a direct line with Abraham via the latter's cast-off son, Ismael, while Judaism is linked to Abraham's more favored child, Isaac. Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and the angel Gabriel each play major roles in the Quran; it was Gabriel, in fact, who transmitted the Word of God to the 40-year-old, seemingly ordinary Muhammad in the 7th century, making him extraordinary to millions today. Sure, anti-Western sentiment creeps into the story, but in every important way Inside Islam is an antidote to gross anti-Muslim bigotry. --Tom Keogh","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1BlAOscyCb8DeG4JYOim2X7cGOx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Islam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
