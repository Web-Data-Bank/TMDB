While she thrives on the fast-paced life of Manhattan, he loathes pretension and could go days without speaking to anyone. But when the two are caught in a perilous situation, they are forced to put aside their pettiness and re-examine their lives. With external factors stripped away, they begin to fall in love. Ultimately, Edith must decide between staying in the glamorous world she has always cherished or leaving it all behind for a chance at love.","popularity":2.245,"poster_path":"/lgYYK3KwBxVs5JDgEOc7dMWMmUt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3958,"logo_path":"/xkdYNmOW6e4gjgp4NSLRt0W5UIj.png","name":"Front Street Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":7483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hearst Entertainment Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lee Rose Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":31551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pacific Motion Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":694,"logo_path":"/5LEHONGkZBIoWvp1ygHOF8iyi1M.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-02-14","revenue":5000000,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love surfaces in the strangest places.","title":"Navigating the Heart","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
