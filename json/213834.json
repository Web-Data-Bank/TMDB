Parents, with the help of the non-profit group Parent Revolution, gather signatures from over 51% of the families at McKinley Elementary School in Compton, CA. When their petitions are turned in to the district, demanding that a charter school take over McKinley, the controversy begins. Everyday people, who simply want a better life for their children, suddenly find themselves doing extraordinary things: appearing on television, speaking at press conferences, lobbying in the state capital, and becoming community leaders. On their journey they inspire a national movement and discover that education is a political beast.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/knl0Eix6H34mCmwJp3H8sGT0Bvi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We the Parents","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
