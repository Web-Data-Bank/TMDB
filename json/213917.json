Estranged from her husband, she's with her children only every other weekend. It's her weekend, but her agent has booked her to MC a Rotary club dinner in Vichy. She takes them with her, and when her husband learns this, he demands to pick them up at once. She bolts in a rented car to the seaside, trying to improve her relations with the children, especially the precocious and distant Vincent. He loves astronomy. A rare meteor shower is due in a few days, so she suggests they go to a plateau in Spain hoping to see it. He agrees, but the relationship remains difficult, and her husband is on their trail.","popularity":1.67,"poster_path":"/ydEACfC8tDoXXTFlvk2ZEPS4nTz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6274,"logo_path":"/7maUXkVK7nbKILS08jwlCJXWKZj.png","name":"MK2 Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1990-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Other Weekend","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7}
