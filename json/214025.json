Her husband has just left her. Until this point, she was fairly content with her life, but now everything is in ruins. A friend advises her to make a fresh start. But how is that supposed to work? Especially if you see yourself as a team player and there’s no team in sight you would want to join. Driven by a sense of longing, helplessness and curiosity, Silvi tries to make new friends and, in her own, touchingly earnest but also naïve and charmingly uninhibited way, starts to take control of her life. Anonymous sex, cosy romanticism and bondage games catapult her from one emotional disaster to the next. But, thankfully, Silvi is indestructible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vlRsw6u4EKTNf4dJmM5iQxB56MQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16208,"logo_path":null,"name":"SUESSSAUERFILM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One woman, three men and that old longing.","title":"Silvi - Maybe Love","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2}
