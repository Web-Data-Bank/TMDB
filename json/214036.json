Died in Lebanon.\" \"Born in Palestine. Died in Syria.\" \"Born in Palestine. Died in Jordan.\" The camera pans across an endless row of white tombstones. The Shadow of Absence takes death as its subject yet in doing so presents a powerful statement about Palestinian life. Weaving elements of his own story of dislocation into the Palestinian collective narrative, filmmaker Nasri Hajjaj reverses the usual focus of the Nakba documentary by exploring the denial of the Palestinian right to death and burial in the homeland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uubCM7LqKFiARVPZjgTA0Ab163U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shadow of Absence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
