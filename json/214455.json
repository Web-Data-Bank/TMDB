He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch, leaving his body covered in agonizing sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. In his last months Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a film, first broadcast in March, that was an uplifting, confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man. Not shying away from the grim reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p4ZoaQKvZHsX2s57Y7Q2IW5rMWT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":103441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yipp Films Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":8}
