On October 13, 1972, a young rugby team from Montevideo, Uruguay, boarded a plane for a match in Chile—and then vanished into thin air. Two days before Christmas, 16 of the 45 passengers miraculously resurfaced. They had managed to survive for 72 days after their plane crashed on a remote Andean glacier. Thirty-five years later, the survivors returned to the crash site—known as the Valley of Tears—to recount their harrowing story of defiant endurance and indestructible friendship.","popularity":2.532,"poster_path":"/hFGePVacFCT0kr0niRBdp1AjCc7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158391,"logo_path":null,"name":"La realidad","origin_country":""},{"id":101998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ethan Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":106082,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeitgeist Films","origin_country":""},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2007-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Andes crash survivors in their own words","title":"Stranded: I've Come from a Plane That Crashed on the Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":16}
