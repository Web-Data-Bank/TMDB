When her mother dies at birth, Pamela is raised by her father, Wayne. He makes a commitment to pray with his daughter each and every night. He also raises her with a very high standard of purity before marriage. In an age when purity is scoffed at by the world, and even in some Christian circles, this movie presents the message with inspiration and perspective. Also, the prayerful commitment of Wayne Bucklin is an example for all who are in a parental role.","popularity":0.768,"poster_path":"/2mb6ZfsMSCE5caSgZEtnCzzFoqt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dave Christiano Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Yes, it seemed unfair... until the day she married.","title":"Pamela's Prayer","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
