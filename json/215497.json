His joy and excitement, however, turn into something darker when one of his neighbours (a sad, drunken man whose own children have recently thrown him out of the house) suggests a sordid future for both Vincent and his child. Something inside him snaps and he embarks on a pyschotic mission of 'close cleansing'. -Peter Mullan, Director  \"Close\" is a short film on the darker side of fatherhood, of paternal love swerving dangerously down the wrong path. The mood is disturbing, violent and darkly comic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6SrBqdAVphWNiN5Nc79P7UGjQ7m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Close","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
