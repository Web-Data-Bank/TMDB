Both marginalized as the long-lasting effect of American abandonment of the said base, Intoy has become Kalye Marino’s best “tahong” caretaker-with-no-angst-about-poverty, while Doray a cheap prostitute-with-no-guilt, tending to her siblings’ needs.  Intoy strives to have his own cages of “tahong” so he can have Doray, not for just a night of quickie sex, but forever.  But what will he do to when she offers to drop by his hovel-on-stilts to quench his passion, but before it happens Nature has chosen to play a joke on his tahong cage?  Will it be goodbye to his tahong business or to his damsel-in-distress and ultimately to Kalye Marino?  From Eros S. Atalia’s 2001 Palanca Grand Prize-winning Short Story, Intoy Syokoy ng Kalye Marino is a love tale minus the obligatory romantic sentiments.","popularity":0.704,"poster_path":"/njIaV9wqQ8ePwHtQ6miN9CxyFXu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemalaya Foundation","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intoy Syokoy ng Kalye Marino","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
