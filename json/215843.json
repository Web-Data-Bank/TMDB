It stars Toralv Maurstad as Grieg and features an international cast including Florence Henderson, Christina Schollin, Robert Morley, Harry Secombe, Oskar Homolka, Edward G. Robinson and Frank Porretta (as Rikard Nordraak). Filmed in Super Panavision 70 by Davis Boulton and presented in single-camera Cinerama in some countries, it was an attempt to capitalise on the success of The Sound of Music.","popularity":2.348,"poster_path":"/Q3MYIDo0hSMbPFTZI6lZnruqcO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":634,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABC Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anchor Bay Home Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":5892,"logo_path":"/AlfRSqTMw9RIHR2RIzy4pkcaXnY.png","name":"Buena Vista International","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pearson Television International","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":11275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinerama Productions Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-11-04","revenue":7800000,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A song for the heart to sing...for the world to love!","title":"Song of Norway","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":5}
