The film follows four characters - two leftover punks from the 80s, a typical gray-suited businessman and a vegetarian idealist - in their desperate struggle to hold onto their respective stations in life. These deftly interwoven stories form a cautionary tale of how people deal with the search for quick cash. In desperate times, even good people turn to bad money.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l5FvMqBXwCVn9TC8fLzgaMdIyOs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Devil Films","origin_country":""},{"id":174070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Security Film Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Truly Funny, Quirky Film","title":"Bad Money","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
