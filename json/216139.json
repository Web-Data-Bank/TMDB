In 1980, young Loreen Graham is on a school outing to the Salem Witch Museum when a wax figure of a man from 1692 comes to life and accosts her. It seems that she may be the reincarnation of Ann, who has accused the man's 5-year-old girl of witchcraft and the girl is scheduled to be burned at the stake.
