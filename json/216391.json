He unsuccessfully tries to adapt to the modern Russian savage life. The world around him lives by rules dictated by the black market and Chechen wars. It is a cruel and unjust world, where you can survive only with a bunch of stolen dollars instead of brains. For a young Russian, money is a symbol of power and strength.
