After Alfredo receives a promotion, the two move away to Mexico City where they immediately feel the social pressure of being overweight in a bustling metropolis full of beautiful people. Taking the initiative, Carmen convinces her husband to join her in losing weight, but their relationship is put to the test when Alfredo’s program yields far better results than Carmen’s. From award-winning director Marianna Chenillo comes a touching comedy about how true beauty comes from the inside and paradise is closer to home than you might think.","popularity":1.088,"poster_path":"/zqVLVWLRA2LQelmxozSTqvh6pK9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1719,"logo_path":"/nCCpnwdybGqektBEjqpz6WX0cbF.png","name":"Canana","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2013-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":28}
