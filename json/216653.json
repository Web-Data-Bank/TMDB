Lillian lives in a quiet yet comfortable isolation, sharing an apartment with her grandmother, an aging widow. Their dependence on one another is mutual, simultaneously making them whole and holding them back. Dan's dependence is more tactile. Living in more tortured solitude, his attempts at human connection are carried out in the only way he can manage: in compulsive fits and starts. After a chance meeting, Lillian and Dan bump and misstep their way towards one another in a love story that is awkward and small, that stutters and spits, with its worry lines on its face and its heart on its sleeve.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/goKt1xoA1bwPsUWAKg2hWoXB8T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finally, Lillian and Dan","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
