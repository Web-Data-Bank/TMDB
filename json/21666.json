Against their proper sensibilities, many of the Brits don't much like the brash Yanks, especially when it comes to the G.I.s making advances on the lonely British girls. One relationship that develops is between married John, an Army Captain, and the aristocratic Helen, whose naval husband is away at war. Helen loves her husband, but Helen and John are looking for some comfort during the difficult times.","popularity":5.057,"poster_path":"/zsTyD3U9iiFDYGWW3Xix4Q2Opuf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14309,"logo_path":null,"name":"CIP Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In 1942 everyone loved a soldier","title":"Yanks","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":45}
