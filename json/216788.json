A wholly female duel punctuated by the refusal to drink, eat and sleep; more obstinate than the sun of Palermo and more stubborn than the ferocity of the men who surround them. For, as in every duel, it is a question of life or death... Itâ€™s a Sunday afternoon. The sirocco is blowing pitilessly in Palermo when Rosa and Clara lose their way in the streets of the city and end up in a sort of alley: Via Castellana Bandiera. At the same moment, another car driven by Samira, crammed with members of the Calafiore family, arrives from the opposite direction and enters the same street.","popularity":1.361,"poster_path":"/1mEcUbsjIU304rPfHT97lgcq4eU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7144,"logo_path":"/wqc8HTYdCCFnguN2Ma55lr2HIyC.png","name":"Vivo Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":5030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Offside","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":21246,"logo_path":"/e5NWP10OYWCUa0T363WxkNzL78s.png","name":"Wildside","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":10358,"logo_path":"/pvgiWovEFHYoOO49V7arAhitWTM.png","name":"Ventura Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":7777,"logo_path":"/vd6oWpxQXyaeWGfm0A5SnJi8pyo.png","name":"Slot Machine","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Street in Palermo","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":29}
