It follows the story of Isabel, a veteran drug mule, in her first attempt at running her own drug transshipment operation between Manila and China.  Isabelâ€™s character is based on the story of an actual Filipina drug mule who was caught with eight capsules of heroin lodged in her sex organ, 48 in the rectum and 11 in her abdomen after an x-ray was conducted by Chinese authorities.  Cuchera presents an accurate depiction of how some Filipinos end up becoming entrenched in the world of illegal drugs.  Currently, the Philippines leads all Southeast Asian countries in the number of nationals arrested for drug smuggling charges in China.  As of 2009, there are currently 95 Filipinos languishing in various jails in Chinese territories---four of whom are on death row.  Violators include minors who enter China with fake passports.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rbmFp42M06IddBRDXAN5Qb9bvOD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemalaya Foundation","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2011-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cuchera","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
