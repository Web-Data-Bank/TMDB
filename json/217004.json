Enraged and thirsty for vengeance, a mob of torch bearing villagers march through an eerie wood in search of an evil child-eating woman. But dealing their own brand of justice, this might just be the worst mistake of their lives, as the one they seek possesses a darker power then they would have ever imagined. Spider woman spins the nightmarish tale of an unsuspecting group of people encountering a mystical world of buried secrets, human possession and gigantic spiders. Evil never takes kindly to those who oppose it...and in this case, its counterattack pounces with eight-legged agility.","popularity":0.982,"poster_path":"/wdQKCYMAmOlqGwT3WW175nsmoP8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Death's Web","title":"Spider Woman","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
