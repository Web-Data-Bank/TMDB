Featuring a tour de force performance cameo by Wil Wheaton (Stand by Me, TV’s Star Trek: Next Generation) as a Christian bookstore manager, Fag Hag pays homage to John Waters while launching a bold new message to the gay community.  The film is set in Hope Springs, CA where we meet Destiny Rutt (Stephanie Orff; RESPECT MY ASS), a pathological liar and last place shoe-in for the first annual Miss Hope Springs Pageant.  When Destiny meets Scott Bushey – a gay drifter whose ambition is to make it big as the worlds first white HIV-positive rap star “T-Cell”, the two make fast friends and resolve “to take this town of outdated gay guys by storm!”","popularity":0.78,"poster_path":"/55KmSjRqJksfsPI0HnAVRxVW6eD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Potemkin Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3052,"logo_path":"/kqP7DC8cUCzDSI5SXiJKJKmQg1K.png","name":"Troma Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Here comes a fabulously homo-genius film!","title":"Fag Hag","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":5}
