Of a father, who grieves for his lost son. Of a young woman who fights so hard with life that she has forgotten to love. Of an ambitious rabble-rouser, for whom action is the knee-jerk mantra. It is the story of how these four discover one another, and come together to raise hell, shaking the powers that be to their very roots! But, Satyagraha is also the story of an influential power-hungry despot who will stop at nothing to destroy them.","popularity":3.223,"poster_path":"/wJQh5a8KsnwajTqGzd4gt2akmQO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19145,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prakash Jha Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":2320,"logo_path":"/nSAXfUCy16cNRiPlBMHeb700t9p.png","name":"UTV Motion Pictures","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2013-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Revolution Has Begun!","title":"Satyagraha","video":false,"vote_average":6.167,"vote_count":30}
