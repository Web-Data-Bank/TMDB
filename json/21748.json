Take a journey around the planet to experience our most extreme storms and to witness the dramatic--and often perilous--efforts of scientists in the pursuit of understanding weather.Join meteorologists in the cockpit of a P-3 weather plane as they penetrate the eye of a hurricane; and in the tense, decisive moments on the road as they focus their radar on an approaching tornado, traveling to the heart of severe storms to learn what makes weather systems tick. Experience the bumpy ride into the sudden and spectacular calm of a hurricane’s eye, or the commando-like raid to the very brink of a killer tornado, and experience one of the elemental joys of doing science: that of confronting nature head-on to divine its awesome secrets.","popularity":1.097,"poster_path":"/rUgd4PWzggnzpFgOZm8yJDOWXyG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2753,"logo_path":null,"name":"MacGillivray Freeman Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Succeeds in allowing one to get a good view of Mother Nature’s ferocity, up close and personal","title":"Stormchasers","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
