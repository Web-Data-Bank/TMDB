A passionate architect with strong but delusional ideas about love and life. A Czech gypsy girl searching for her identity and true love. Add to the drama of a mean friend you canâ€™t do without and cannot trust either. The conflict of these complex characters is further heightened with illusions of someone who is there but at the same time not there- what you see is not true? or is the truth, what you not see? All of the above are thrown together in a very unique and unusual situation where you do not know what to believe and what to disbelieve.","popularity":0.8,"poster_path":"/nIjlbe5aczjglnjsXYEhOc8CVkU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prague","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6}
