I divided the original film into scenes (like I did with \"Faces\") and then replaced each scene with one shot filmed at the original location (unlike \"Faces\" where shots were gleaned from the original film itself). My \"Easy Rider\" tries to find today’s counter-culture (if one exists) by replacing the 60’s music with music that I listen to today.' ~ James Benning","popularity":1.395,"poster_path":"/opyQ1lbQYrO3hyDUwTPfQZTWRJW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Easy Rider","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
