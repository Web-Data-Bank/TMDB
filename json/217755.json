She teaches deaf children, he is a musician, working on his own compositions. Their separate worlds, one silent, the other full of sounds, create a vivid pattern of contrasts, which affect their emotional lives and their living together. From the time they move into the house, they are strangely aware of something odd, especially she, while he concentrates more and more upon his work. A series of incidents adds to her growing uneasiness about the house. Its past seems to creep in on her.
