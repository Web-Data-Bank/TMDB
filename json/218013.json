A tale of seven brave riders who set out from the four corners of the globe to gather together under one roof in a town located at the ends of the earth. A tale with no beginning and no end but where a few things happen in between. Things like eel fights. Yeah that's right... eel fights. So watch this movie. Why? Because it's NotBad... 30 days of bicycle tomfoolery in New Zealand. A new film from the crew who brought you The Collective, Roam, Seasons, Follow Me and Strength in Numbers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3jf87vHwtOZsfWPw1YftH2iYBIc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NotBad","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
