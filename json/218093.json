In 1650, Peter Stuyvesant (Charles Coburn) arrives in New Amsterdam to assume his duties as governor. Stuyvesant is hardly the fun-loving type, and one of his first official acts is to call for the death of Brom Broeck (Nelson Eddy), a newspaper publisher well-known for his fearless exposes of police and government corruption. However, Broeck hasn't done anything that would justify the death penalty, so Stuyvesant waits (without much patience) for Broeck to step out of line. Broeck is romancing a beautiful woman named Tina Tienhoven (Constance Dowling), whose sister Ulda (Shelley Winters) happens to be dating his best friend, Ten Pin (Johnnie \"Scat\" Davis). After Stuyvesant's men toss Broeck in jail on a trumped-up charge, Stuyvesant sets his sights on winning Tina's affections.","popularity":1.24,"poster_path":"/4IeyT46WeL9RL5MQgFRGD22NhJa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161347,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producers Corporation of America","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"WHEN TIMES SQUARE WAS FULL OF INDIANS...LITTLE OLD NEW YORK WAS FULL OF FUN!","title":"Knickerbocker Holiday","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
