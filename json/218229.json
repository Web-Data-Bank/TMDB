The film opens with fans talking about their unwavering devotion to the singer and the unique appeal of this unusual venue – a striking contrast to the sold out arena concert at the Staples Center on the previous night. Tickets to the concert in the 1,800-seater school auditorium were sold out in 12 seconds and this now legendary concert became Morrissey’s penultimate performance on the US Tour.  Featuring many classic tracks from the artist’s prolific repertoire including Meat Is Murder, Everyday Is Like Sunday, Please, Please Please Let Me Get What I Want and The Boy With The Thorn In His Side, Morrissey 25: Live is an unmissable cinema event for fans worldwide.","popularity":1.146,"poster_path":"/vzmuszYOuAW7aFdCbANmDvloto4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morrissey - 25 Live","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
