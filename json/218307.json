Assigned to shoot the Swiss ice skater Karen Vadja, he arrives too late, so decides to film a woman skating on a different New York rink and pass her off as Karen.  The scheme backfires when promoter Larry Herman takes a look at Bob's film and decides to make the skater a star. Unfortunately, it's actually amateur (and illegal immigrant) Marie Bergin in the newsreel footage, not the great figure skater from Switzerland. Chaos ensues as Bob tries to straighten everybody out.","popularity":1.107,"poster_path":"/AvWv56D40QSwbYa74CpOQdzoJuL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"IT'S DAZZLING! a thousand laughs...and thrills...as Hollywood's Gay Blades take to skates to \"sleigh\" the Blues!","title":"Ice-Capades","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
