Alice Faye is the loyal burleycue singer who helps make Baxter a success. His head turned by sudden fame, Baxter falls under the spell of a society woman (Mona Barrie) who has theatrical aspirations of her own. She marries Baxter, then convinces him to produce a string of \"artistic\" plays rather than his extravagant musical revues. The plays are flops, and the woman haughtily divorces Baxter. Faithful Alice Faye, who'd gone to London when her ex-beau was married, returns to the penniless Baxter. She and her burlesque buddies team up to pull Baxter out of his rut and put him on top again.","popularity":1.236,"poster_path":"/5qdGozrcDe6P2QcB4ff4yaqEFk8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gay as the Great White Way","title":"King of Burlesque","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4}
