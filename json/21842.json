She is married to a lazy husband and has four children, all named after her favorite Swedish Eurovision popstars. Her brother is a crossdressing guy self-titled \"Candy Darling\". Mona works in a retirement home for disabled people, where she is responsible for taking care of a young man named David who suffers a movement-restricting disease forcing him into a wheelchair. David's parents have abandoned him, as they wanted a normal child. Mona holds a big place in David's heart, and vica versa. David's goal is to get his parents to come and visit him, and he wants to show them that he is a great person, despite his handicap. Therefore he works with music on his computer, and his goal is to create a song, send it to \"The Cardigans\", a famous Swedish band and have them play the song and credit him, hoping his parents would spot it and want to visit him.","popularity":2.838,"poster_path":"/9VwP8fMxTVErL4w5SUdPfe6cMCz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":327,"logo_path":"/vodjjKlAbwGeERPjrAhxZMBGPUc.png","name":"Nordisk Film Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":1929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sonet Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":758,"logo_path":"/fft3jrctrZNcgAxgN1w5Givtzip.png","name":"TV 2","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2000-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once in a Lifetime","video":false,"vote_average":4.429,"vote_count":21}
