The woman he has loved has vanished from his life 'forever'. Rene Maurer, one of his regular patients, has died - an apparent suicide. Rene's sister, Erika, traveling to London to sort out his things, discovers something curious - his apartment is almost empty. A cup, a spoon, a fork, a knife, frames without pictures, torn photos... One more curiosity - a list of memories. Four dated descriptions of moments in Rene's life. Another patient dies. Another list of memories. There's something strange going on. Something sinister behind these 'suicides'","popularity":1.14,"poster_path":"/j6baxtqxevWKXiJc8tT3atticGr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Third Contact","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5}
