But it's not the over-the-top-dumb-dialogue-kind of lesbian porn that guys get off on, so her producers demand a re-shoot. At the same time she's directing the first lesbian love story for a pseudo-reality TV dating show, with her bubbly Gen-X pal Azusa and an office manager/dominatrix go-go dancer named Miki as the featured couple. All the while, Naomi spends her nights online, confessing her fears and dreams to a gentle, supportive soul known only by her screen name Sugar.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4IMZAENWrrZFhyNwBJWOSAVFhri.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39440,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aspire Vision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life is stranger than fiction","title":"Sugar Sweet","video":false,"vote_average":0.8,"vote_count":2}
