Without the use of dialogue we see the boy exists inside a transparent bubble. His peers grow up to active social lives, while he continues to fly inside his bubble, isolated, within an insular world that the boy's increasingly desperate parents are unable to penetrate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3922,"logo_path":"/uXDOnG25HLnban0UfpRVjxASMWW.png","name":"A.
