This movie follows a doomed character who can't seem to go a day without tripping, venturing into one misadventure after another. Yes, taking acid can make a normal routine, like going to work, seem like an odyssey, complete with monsters (toilet sharks), perils (the sidewalk turning into an inferno), and beautiful maidens. Peter Steele from Type O Negative guest stars in this unusual comedy.","popularity":0.958,"poster_path":"/96fr1HySy6384SNnJSYLlCOIGCz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Acid","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
