It’s not what he does but a manipulation; I got them to act as they thought a screen test would be in a Warhol sense, and then I recontextualised it so we could talk about how acting might not be screened the way you thought you acted. Especially today with these manipulations, and Hollywood films with collaging and green screens: groups of people going ‘aaaah!’, like that, and the monster isn’t even there. So it’s that idea. But it’s a nice little film, with an amazingly diverse group of students.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Warhol","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
