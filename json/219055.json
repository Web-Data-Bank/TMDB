Together they go on a \"luminous journey\" in his beautiful red truck. She, escaping her desperate and incestuous father; he, far from his native Scotland and the sad memory of his lost wife and daughter. In the course of a few days, a few words, Céline experiences her first true moments of childhood and lightness, exhilaration and trust. Peter goes towards the last days of a life that he offers, like a sublime and aging angel, to this wounded child.","popularity":1.242,"poster_path":"/3pW8VxrssIB9OyBidZtbWt3f886.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Love Streams agnès b.
