Inspired by the Lumière brothers’ first film, La sortie de l’usine Lumière à Lyon, which shows a large number of workers leaving their factory’s gate, Gruzei begins in the interior, in a passageway (made to seem incredibly long by the editing) that emerges from the darkness. Solely portions of the corridor — a production line at the closed Austria Tabak factory — flash into view in the buzzing neon light. The impressive sound and choreography of light were taken from an installation by the artist in the empty spaces.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wNVCIIUMCJ4C2KiRlUTISE0ywj7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Workers Leaving the Factory (again)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
