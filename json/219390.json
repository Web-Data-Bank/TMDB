David Lee Birdsong is the smalltown quarterback hoping to escape with a college scholarship and a pro career. David's father is the overbearing taskmaster vicariously living through his son. The third side of the triangle is Coach Marshall, a hypercritical and cruel man who sees David as the key to his future success. David's lockstep commitment to his father and coach is altered when he witnesses a teammate die after a grueling practice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j91aX2FhqvGj8hxMOmmn6y0Iu9D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1556,"logo_path":"/31h94rG9hzjprXoYNy3L1ErUya2.png","name":"20th Century Fox Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Sport","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3}
