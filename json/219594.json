This film follows a ten-year-old boy and the strange visions he encounters, his world of fantasy exacerbated with ample time, space, and a lack of companionship or guidance. We see the adults that influence and dominate his life, for better or for worse. Surreal and packed with an excellent study of human emotions and motivations compounded by their rural, isolated vacuum of a town, this is a timeless and severely underrated film from a brilliant Czech director.","popularity":0.99,"poster_path":"/3MIqiihZgpGyBZZe2QxhfF92rIb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1983-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Shepherd Boy from the Valley","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
