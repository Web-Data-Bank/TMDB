With spectacular images from inhospitable landscapes, chimerical phenomena that transpire by the sheer remoteness of the land, and haunting indigenous music from a people that have long been shrouded in mystery, this is a genre-defying film of profound beauty. Explore the intoxicating tapestry of sight and sound that this obscure region has to offer through its most awe-inspiring musicians. Featuring live performances by Group Doueh, Group Marwani, Sadoum Oueld Aida and Group Bab Sahara.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bvET0FalekgcpUw1UnVVvxHuEhQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Palace of the Winds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
