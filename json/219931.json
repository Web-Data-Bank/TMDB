The possessor of a bountiful shoreline, endless acres of tillable farmland, the fourth largest metal reserves on the planet and a remarkable space program (the fourth in the world to send a human being into space), Argentina nevertheless remains a prisoner of backward and disadvantageous economical, political and social systems.","popularity":0.772,"poster_path":"/wqy0d6MbUbBxfU1duTuLl1Ldm2C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinesur","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2007-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dormant Argentina","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":6}
