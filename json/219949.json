A progressive social worker has Harley sent to Texas to live with the Nortons, an open-minded, heartful Christian family, and spend two months on their ranch. Surrounded by a town full of doddering hicks, Harley takes on ranch chores, learns to ride horses, and finds love in a local girl while the Nortons try to bring him into the fold.
