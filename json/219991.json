To win her (and half the kingdom) he needs to fulfil 3 tasks given by the Caliph. The poem quotes are by Omar Kayyam (1048-1123) from Nishapur, now Iran; Babur (Zahiriddin Muhammad Bobur) (1483-1530) ( Founder of the Mogul Empire), born in Andijan in present day Uzbekistan; Nizami Ganjavi (1141-1209)  from Ganja, now Azerbaijan link , Ali-Shir Nava’i  ;(Alisher Navoi) (1441-1501) link from Herat, now Afghanistan. Perhaps good to remind you that Kalisher comes from the Region. Born in Ashchabat (Turkmenistan), he lived and worked until 1967 in Tasjkent, Uzbekistan. Followed by “The barefoot Erudite”(1988), and “The Obedient Pupil”(1991) the animation shows an interest in respectively Persian, Chinese and Indian wisdom and mysticism, not very common yet at the time in the atheistic oriented Soviet Union","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soyuztelefilm","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":6608,"logo_path":"/eALlDyTQSw5rLU1IJvYps4himcU.png","name":"Ekran","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1987-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh, Princess!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
