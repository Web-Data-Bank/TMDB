Whether following at close range the semi-circular motion of a handsome, pacing leopard, its spots evoking rhythmic patterns through Fanderl's intuitive shooting process, or closely studying a tray of glassware on a ship as the sea reflects and refracts through the crystalline shapes, the artist fully gives herself over to the present moment and allows us to bask in it.","popularity":1.344,"poster_path":"/2sTkZV0rt0M7RRXk2I78Ydaetmy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Constellations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
