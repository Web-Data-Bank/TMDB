In addition to gazillions of press and radio interviews, and television appearances, the main event of the visit was the taping of a television special devoted entirely to ABBA. The special featured ABBA performing no less than 14 songs, three of which were performed live with a full orchestra backing, resulting in unique arrangements never used before or since. The television special, simply entitled ABBA Special, was subsequently released on VHS and laser-disc.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aE7xt5svX6ixvr9pixTGDlDBc7Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ABBA In Japan","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":3}
