The film has aesthetic shades of Mark Leckey's Turner prize-winning 'Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore' or the black sense of humour in the classic 1st series of the Chris Morris-produced 'Look Around You', but 'MisinforMation' is more subtly febrile, lucidly reflecting the effective slow infection of a nation's psyche present in the original films. A prized Hauntological document, but also a strangely alluring and oddly beautiful document of a bygone era we just cant seem to let go of.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Misinformation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
