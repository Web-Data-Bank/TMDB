Within 50 years, that population was cut in half as Western diseases claimed thousands of lives. A litany of events followed: American missionaries preached unfamiliar ideas and customs; sugarcane and pineapple plantations absorbed individual farmlands; waves of immigrant workers arrived, making Hawaiians a minority in their own land; and WWII brought a lasting military presence. University of Hawai'i sociologists estimate that the extinction of full-blooded Hawaiians could come within the next 45 years.  This compelling story of a race displaced and now on the verge of extinction is brilliantly told in this award-winning documentary created by the great-granddaughter of Hawaiian high chiefs and English seafarers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hsl0JePvUTofYDF1TxEHYgarjcX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73486,"logo_path":null,"name":"PIC","origin_country":"US"},{"id":73487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hawaii Public Television","origin_country":""},{"id":73488,"logo_path":null,"name":"LLB Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Then There Were None","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
