Mathematical notations of precise time-code editing were applied to construct illustrations of temporal symmetry, duality and transposition — time-based equivalents of musical compositional principles such as counterpoint and serialism. Astonishing temporal interventions — a 180-degree pan gazing downward on a New York City street that progresses from day to night, an image of Mount Rainier in which the foreground and background unfold in different time planes — unfold as symbolic transformations of natural and urban landscapes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d8sUOG5p2E51aQYTGt7MPu7pnwu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ancient of Days","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8}
