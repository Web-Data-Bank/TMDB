The DVD offers 17 of the band's songs, most of which are found on the two CD albums \"Sehnsucht\" and \"Herzeleid.\" The show itself is a very entertaining performance with plenty of the usual stunts, pyrotechnics, and lighting effects you'd expect from an industrial metal band.","popularity":3.336,"poster_path":"/uqpd4rcqRgQsDEsy5SKz1m1TQYj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motor Music","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rammstein - Live aus Berlin","video":true,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":24}
