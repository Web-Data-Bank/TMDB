One day, her family is waiting for their perfect daughter to arrive at the breakfast table and kiss them good morning as always. But this morning Anna wakes up with a horrible illness. She looks like a sad version of Marilyn Manson and is terribly moody.  Not realizing what is “wrong” with their daughter, Anna’s parents decide to take her to Dr. Artmanns’ clinic for kids with behavioural problems. In his analysis of Anna, Dr. Artmann uses a huge labyrinth where Anna is exposed to various tasks. The only way out of the maze for Anna is to complete her tasks in the right manners. But the right way is not necessarily what the parents think to be the right one.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hXRvm1gpEKUWMExKz5bMCcwJRBy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2007-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anna and the Moods","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
