He is funny in all his actions, yet when he puts on his shoes you can imagine the noise he can make when he dances an ordinary clog. The shoes referred to are made of some elastic material which enables Little Tich to bow almost to the floor without bending his legs, the spring in the shoes carrying him down and up again. He places his hat on the floor and, leaning over on the toes of his wonderful shoes, dips his head into the hat and comes up without having to move from the spot or to bend his legs. He is a comical looking sight at best, being made up to suit the part, and he will make you laugh whether you want to or not.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1900-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Tich and His Funny Feet","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":12}
