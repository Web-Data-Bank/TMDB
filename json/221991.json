Sixteen year-old student Jānis has been given an interesting homework assignment – to draw his family tree and explain it. The story of his family begins with his great-great-grandfather who burned down the manors of German landowners during the 1905 revolution. My Family Tree takes us on a journey to various countries and political regimes, showing Jānis’ ancestors to be people of diverse fates and life stories. A rich Latvian trader, a red rifleman loyal to Lenin, a carpenter with the KGB and war refugees in Sweden are only a few branches on his family tree, and the boy has heard something unusual and unforgettable about each and every one of these people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nlpbb9Mjh4eDpzA6l3GH6MhPpjl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fenixfilm","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2013-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Family Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
