Simply put, the film concerns a doctor, his wife, and his brother. The doctor, a specialist in pediatrics, has no time for his wife Marthe. She seeks solace in the arms of his brother. Unable to keep up the charade, Marthe attempts to shoot herself, but it is her lover who is mortally wounded.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/byx1elutxrUCuEEDeQ4KG77hsXT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinédis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1917-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Torture of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
