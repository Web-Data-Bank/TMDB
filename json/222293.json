We follow Piling, a young soccer fanatic, through a slum district of Manila. No ball or cleats, but a Coke can and flip-flops are the ingredients for a virtuoso demonstration of the football art. Only at the end does it become apparent why the little ball juggler will never be a Ronaldinho.","popularity":0.699,"poster_path":"/vqMXQCCMQWShdsE7klCh8mMcEUR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmless Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2005-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Can & Slippers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
