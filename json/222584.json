After many years he meets Sebastian, his childhood friend, and they spend a whole summer together drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana and walking around in the blazing sun of Santiago. They both come from dysfunctional families (Diego's mother is an alcoholic and Sebastian feels abandoned by his father and his stepmother), but the need to discover the world around them and explore their inner feelings brings them closer to each other, making their friendship very, very intense. The desire that ties them to each other is palpable, and soon barriers and fears fall, leading them to wonder what they really want.","popularity":1.084,"poster_path":"/wVo2CxtJx50mUcjko64gvf6yypg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2011-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Story of Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":13}
