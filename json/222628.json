In 1996, five overworked Yale undergrads formed a club to watch porno films on weekends while ingesting mass quantities of fried chicken and Miller High Life. As the \"Porn 'n' Chicken Club\" gained members and notoriety, the hide-bound Yale Establishment ordered that the club be closed down. Defiantly, the original members scraped together enough money to produce their own X-rated movie -- and much to the dismay of the faculty and administration, the club became more popular and renowned than ever. In the film, all character names are changed, and even Yale is not mentioned by name (it was filmed on the campus of Columbia University). What remains constant is the youthful exuberance of the club members and the anal-retentive reaction of the authority figures, notably Kurt Fuller as the Dean. Real-life porn stars Ron Jeremy and Jenna Jameson make amusing cameo appearances.","popularity":2.54,"poster_path":"/eTqf862kx7LshQW6MS56qKwyg2U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1538,"logo_path":"/3q7NjXSLVUPQ24CG3zrBPK7GQqH.png","name":"Comedy Central","origin_country":"US"},{"id":11391,"logo_path":"/t6m0uRTzaFHCsvEpikENE0PWJGb.png","name":"Tribeca Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orly Adelson Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There are some things even the best schools can't teach you","title":"Porn 'n Chicken","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":5}
