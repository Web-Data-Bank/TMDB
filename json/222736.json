And they're not just bullies, at least they think they are. They beat metalheads and fascists for ideological reasons, assert their simple order based on a special kind of justice and the right of the strong. In addition, Harlequin himself tries to think about complex universal values and connect them with the way of life he leads. However, he is faced with people who have their own order, not the same as the main character. And then the party life turns into a real tragedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1Ox5jnjKoMHogjHzFrTrvALFTvR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12617,"logo_path":"/9Wf5DFTvzxo0pSqDp8MQWW3d01.png","name":"Belarusfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1988-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Name Is Harlequin","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7}
