After thirty years of chasing wars and conflicts, Bernard-Henri Lévy takes us along for a journey reminiscent of Malraux and Hemingway, though retaining a style all his own. Six-months of exceptional dramaturgy. Six months of a war for freedom, resulting in the fall of one of the longest, most relentless dictatorships of modern times. A war with a beginning but perhaps no end. The making of a war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sAVDuowHKzU6lS4Dw9lbOjnOOtr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Margo Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oath of Tobruk","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
