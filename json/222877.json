When the Marquis escapes his prison, she must follow him to his remote chateau of sin to finally discover her sister's fate, and to face her own.","popularity":1.287,"poster_path":"/y3ah3IqRYvs7e351m7AA6UogWcq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39536,"logo_path":null,"name":"AFRA Film Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":9341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Etalon-Film","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":170585,"logo_path":"/1nUzkMSbZOzoYgHHhBSJ5xGwnIm.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The most impure tale ever told...","title":"Marquis de Sade","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":4}
