For most of us, “house” means stability, structure, and permanence. In an age of increasing population and technological gains, today’s mobile society has resulted in a demand, or perhaps a dream, for portable dwellings and dwellings in new settings and situations.\r Microtopia explores how architects, artists and ordinary problem-solvers are pushing the limits to find answers to their dreams of portability, flexibility – and of creating independence from “the grid”. Modern nomads, homeless people, people in stress, people in need of privacy or seclusion. We hear about the personal reasons behind the dwellings, and to see how they actually work. On the sidewalk, on rooftops, in industrial landscapes and in nature we will see and feel how these abodes meet the dreams set up by their creators. Microtopia deals with a contemporary urgent ideas that are addressed, and solved, in a very surprising way.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/43jZWTbVpqk6Sjt2RGimFxAuEG6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary about micro dwellings, downsizing and living off the grid","title":"Microtopia","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
