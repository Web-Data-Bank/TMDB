But before he can meet his watery doom, he is plucked up by the crew of the freighter \"The Ghost\". The ship's formidable captain, Wolf Larsen, sees a challenge in Humphrey; to turn this over educated idealist into a man of action like himself. Larsen succeeds in changing Humphrey's life, but in the process sacrifices himself to the same rage and instability that makes him such a powerful figure. In a gripping final confrontation, Humphrey must stop Wolf from destroying everything around him as he battles his own mortality.
