They regard themselves as morally, intellectually, and financially superior to the rest of society, even though the clan (housed in a mock mock-Tudor cottage in the middle of a Cardiff council estate) includes a convicted arsonist, an astral projectionist, a former Bunny Girl, a part-time private detective and a transgender daughter (James is now Lauren), all of whom seem to live their lives in a parallel universe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2HSUZiUERnd9Eq8Xaiqhhd1A8FD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They all thought he was another Mozart.
