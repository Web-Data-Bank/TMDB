Oberland, with the significant contribution of cellist Gaspar Claus.  Written in 2008 as a deliberation on the creative process, the film relates a day in the life of a young girl and her mother as they brave two very separate realities governed by the desire to both reject, and conform to, the societal roles imposed upon them.  Shot on super 8 between 2009 and 2010 and scored during the spring and summer months of 2010, The Freemartin Calf is imbued with a delicate fragility synonymous with the inner experience of its protagonists.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Freemartin Calf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
