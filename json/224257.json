Elizabeth and the firm's top designer, Tony Blanchard, are having an affair. A particularly nasty blackmailer confronts her with pictures, threatening to give them to Cole; she and Tony agree to pay, but after two deaths and a torched house, things have gotten complicated: infidelity pales next to a murder charge. A high-school yearbook photo takes her further into danger. What motive might explain and connect the twists? Is she ensnared beyond hope?","popularity":0.913,"poster_path":"/yb9c9kQXXDESbkMTH5Yblnmezmq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9024,"logo_path":null,"name":"World International Network (WIN)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Murder","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":2}
