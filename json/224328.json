In 1671, hundreds of men, women, and children suffered in bloody, torturous rituals at the hands of priests unable to contain the evil of the possessed. Were these possessions real, or is the story a hoax to cover up the sins of the deranged priests thirsty for human blood? Bill and his team of cynical paranormal investigators plan to find out the truth.  Armed with the church's historical record, they set out into the wilderness to uncover this series of forgotten atrocities. Alternately gut-punching hilarious and brutally violent, The Cemetery takes the best elements of the old-school slasher film and pushes them to the edge.","popularity":1.516,"poster_path":"/mVAsW6zKNEwFK3itCjZ7znok3Ru.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27791,"logo_path":null,"name":"Backseat Conceptions","origin_country":""},{"id":27792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adversary Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cemetery","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":12}
