When the team travels to the French town of Boulogne for the annual darts tournament, a good time is had by all--and more besides. Jim Carver one of the team's members, is reunited with a little French girl he'd befriended during the war, who has now developed into a beautiful young woman. And Fred Collins makes a poignant journey to the hotel where he'd honeymooned with his late wife. The film works best as a low-key comedy-drama; it is least successful when it ventures into O. Henry territory and strains for \"surprise\" story twists. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/ArtULSwJ4NuVVFQDioGYrkyGt65.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5586,"logo_path":null,"name":"General Film Distributors","origin_country":""},{"id":13712,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.
