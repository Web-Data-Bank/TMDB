Geographer, as the students immediately dub Sluzhkin, attempts to escape from the grueling, dull, stultifying reality of Russia's provincial life in a rafting tour to the Urals. Accompanied by wild, adventure-seeking adolescents, faced with the numerous grim surprises of the nature, Geographer is poised to find himself and his own truth.","popularity":5.525,"poster_path":"/iyWyVgDHYkjejwAQQrUCQXuZYjO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marmot Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2013-07-26","revenue":4037782,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Geographer Drank His Globe Away","video":false,"vote_average":6.767,"vote_count":88}
