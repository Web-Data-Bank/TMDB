Later in the year it was released across Europe to universal acclaim and huge commercial success. Her second album “The Shocking Miss Emerald”, released in the spring of 2013, was a No.1 album in the UK and Holland and continues to be a top chart title in many territories. This performance was filmed at the BBC Radio Theatre for BBC’s “In Concert” series earlier this year, with a 60 minute version being broadcast on BBC Radio 2 and on digital TV. The show features a mix of tracks from both her studio albums, including all her hits, and with a cover version of the Noel Coward song “Mad About The Boy”. Caro Emerald is a wonderful live performer with a fantastic voice and an engaging personality and this concert captures her at her best.","popularity":0.928,"poster_path":"/ujebmYkyKuuaP2hdpP9l7TCRkcs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":157434,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grandmono","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caro Emerald: In Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
