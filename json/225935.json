When 15 year-old Byron’s antics go over the top, his parents realize enough is enough and they decide the family needs a dose of Grandma Sands' no nonsense approach in Birmingham, Alabama.  So the Watsons load up their 1948 Plymouth Brown Bomber and head South. When they finally make it to Birmingham, they meet Grandma Sands and her friend, Mr. Robert and discover that life is very different there than in Flint. During that historic summer, the Watsons find themselves caught up in something far bigger than Byron’s antics; something that will change their lives and country forever.","popularity":4.448,"poster_path":"/m4fvwFuZhEadkU4LI2EsH6AZbUs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17145,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tonik Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":17146,"logo_path":null,"name":"WGTB Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":10221,"logo_path":"/99VfWRgKasZoyK9UVB39gnYvFrZ.png","name":"Walden Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":22}
