Known for locally made above ground cars, an almost infinite variety of breakfast cereals and unbridled, bald-faced greatness.

Can the Americatonians pull together and weather the madness or are they fated to crumble like so many tiny empires before it?","popularity":0.924,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Americatown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
