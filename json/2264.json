Pitting a corrupt building contractor against the new straight-arrow building commissioner, Lola launches an outrageous plan to elevate herself in a world where everything, and everyone, is for sale. Shot in childlike candy colors, Fassbinder’s homage to Josef von Sternberg’s classic The Blue Angel stands as a satiric tribute to capitalism.","popularity":10.072,"poster_path":"/rZqgDP5kRqh2eaPj5uLzYEbWz40.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29165,"logo_path":"/d1wokdgTjC7lJs6yktVd61JZrwD.png","name":"Rialto Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":33352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trio Film","origin_country":""},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lola","video":false,"vote_average":7.197,"vote_count":89}
