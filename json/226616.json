After the revolution, the new United States adopted a radically different economic system in which the government issued its own value-based money, so that private banks like the Bank of England were not siphoning off the wealth of the people through interest-bearing bank notes.  But bankers are nothing if not dedicated to their schemes to acquire your wealth, and know full well how easy it is to corrupt a nation's leaders.  Just one year after Mayer Amschel Rothschild had uttered his infamous \"Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws\", the bankers succeeded in setting up a new Private Central Bank called the First Bank of the United States, largely through the efforts of the Rothschild's chief US supporter, Alexander Hamilton.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6o7ZdkWQAwvBafdZyTNiQdNrqKT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Wars are Bankers' Wars","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
