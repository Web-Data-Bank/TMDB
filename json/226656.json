The film creates a portrait of Mormonism through documentation of LDS cultural dominance in Utah, the suppressed history of folk magic in the early church, landmark Mormon life experiences, and my personal history and connection to the church.  Found media with the voices of outsiders and insiders illuminate a religion that intrigues many, but is seen as mysterious or inaccessible. Liahona shifts through perspectives on the faith â€“ from reverence to questioning, presenting the complexities of the vast institution of Mormonism contrasted with the tenuity of individual faith.","popularity":0.674,"poster_path":"/xHytiJZ38yMunKjirku43ZK3Biq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liahona","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
