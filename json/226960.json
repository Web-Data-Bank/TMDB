The Rock's rise to prominence in the World Wrestling Foundation is shown by the inclusion of showdowns with the Undertaker and the Big Show. The Rock's oddly comical pairing with Mick Foley as \"the Rock and Sock\" connection is also given a fair amount of screen time.","popularity":1.26,"poster_path":"/irVp1yN7UapuALTmFw1nogUPfmR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WWF: The Rock - The People's Champ","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
