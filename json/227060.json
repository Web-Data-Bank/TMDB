A camera trained on the theater's front doors shows a crowd exiting. Most patrons are well dressed: some women carry muffs, almost all wear hats, some are elaborate; the men are in suits, as are many of the boys. All are white. Occasionally, the camera pans up to the marquee. The same people exit more than once; a woman pushing a baby carriage exits twice, By the end, the crowd is more animated, moving more quickly, smiling more. A final shot shows the whole theater in the frame, a crowd in front, a restaurant above.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claremont Theatre, N.Y.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
