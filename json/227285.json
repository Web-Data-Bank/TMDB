When her father dies soon afterwards, she pretty much has to care for herself, as her stepmother whittles away her father's money and possessions. Cinder bides her time by hanging with her best friend Justin, working at the library with the unbearable Lenore, and crushing on Cash, the psycho who tends the lawn, until her 21st birthday, when she inherits the trust fund her father left for her. When she makes off with Justin's clay doll of the voodoo god Baron Samedi, the god visits her to help \"make things happen\" for her--including landing a night with Cash. Little did she know, however, that Cash was in cahoots with her step-mom to do away with her so they could get her trust fund money. Little did Cash and Step-mom know, that Baron Samedi was going to help Cinder get her revenge.","popularity":1.052,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4708,"logo_path":"/k1zjOZ0GIZ1dxGerINlXC3lGAqh.png","name":"Brain Damage Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not all fairy tales end with happily ever after.","title":"Cadaverella","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":3}
