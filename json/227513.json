Sügis 1993","overview":"On October 17, 1993, local government elections were held in Estonia. The film takes the viewer to Antsla, a small town in Võrumaa, where more than a third of the population is retired. All this is a mirror of Estonian life, from which tensions, pains and worries, few joys and high expectations face society. The old laws are no longer valid and the new ones are not yet rooted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4rkoPZzG9u9yFOXhMqinRxXpwuK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6168,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eesti Telefilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1994-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antsla.
