But he was not always the inspirational global phenomenon he is today. Like the heroes in his spiritual classics THE ALCHEMIST and THE PILGRIMAGE, he long-searched for his calling, flirting with death, escaping madness, falling in love, and making rock ’n’ roll history in Brazil, all-the-while striving for success as a writer. A wild ride through a lifetime of stranger-than-fiction adventures, PAULO COELHO’S BEST STORY is a profoundly moving film that goes straight to the heart of the most beloved literary guru of our time, revealing the most incredible wonder of all: the man behind the masterpieces.","popularity":2.33,"poster_path":"/qVPYM2L2H4AxurEWf4GUllqTDCY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Damasco Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":93237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Babel Films S.L.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2014-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Before The Alchemist Became a Phenomenon, One Man's Journey Became a Legend.","title":"Paulo Coelho's Best Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":28}
