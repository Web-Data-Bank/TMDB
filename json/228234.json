Accompanied by the blind Swiss pianist Moncef Genoud and the Director of the Gorée House of Slaves Museum, Joseph N'Diaye, the Senegalese singer wrote new songs during this initiatory voyage which took him to the USA then to Europe. At Gorée, an island just off the Senegalese coast and symbol of the slave trade, his memorable concert marked the end of this quest and the start of a new challenge: making today's generation aware of the tragedy of slavery, the importance of not forgetting and the need for reconciliation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sxWUP8ejWPNAdUzFsJN3pBUaVet.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6938,"logo_path":"/tC0D6PGzq5FAnyPPxnhSQd8FPEv.png","name":"Iris Productions","origin_country":"LU"},{"id":22587,"logo_path":null,"name":"CAB Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":72339,"logo_path":"/mWtSD5jttXRUGa24BX4Li9OYhP6.png","name":"Dreampixies","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2007-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to Gorée","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
