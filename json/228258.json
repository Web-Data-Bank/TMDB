He is crude, uncouth and uneducated. His son, Fred, is the apple of his father's eye and is an auto enthusiast. The widowed Rupp falls in love with a former aristocrat, Helen, now down on her luck and pawning her last heirloom. He proposes marriage and she accepts in order to save her ailing mother who needs a monetary influx to avoid death. Her former boyfriend, Platen, warns Helen against Rupp's intentions - he and Rupp are enemies, Rupp having caused his being fired for protecting a chorus girl against Rupp's unwanted advances. Meanwhile, Graf, a shyster, arranges purchase of a near bankrupt auto manufacturing firm, Phoenix, to Rupp's great advantage with practically no monetary recognition to Graf, who swears revenge. Rupp comes upon his son begging Helen not to marry his father but to return to Platen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pzggbAt17h5PjGdZatlrHDMmV0T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121284,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emil Jannings-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1923-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alles für Geld","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
