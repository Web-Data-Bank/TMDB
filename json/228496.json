Jill's an artist. Ian's a filmmaker. And their love life is off the chain. There's no experience too wild, no dare too dangerousâ€”not even when Jill lets Ian strap her to a gurney in the abandoned hospital they're scoping out for their next art show. But he shouldn't have left her alone. Not even as a joke. Now, Jill's hookup with horror has awakened something in that place. Something with a lust for more than flesh.","popularity":8.11,"poster_path":"/n484SE5u944nFRw4sJ9kr6IN1O3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aeroplano","origin_country":""},{"id":26648,"logo_path":null,"name":"La.Lune Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some tapes shouldn't be made","title":"Sx_Tape","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":92}
