He blows smoke rings which do little tricks. He looks at the audience and taps the ash off his cigar. The telephone rings and makes Jerry jump - he looks cross. We see Jerry and the person he is speaking to in little circular cut-outs placed on another image of a landscape with telegraph poles stretching off into the distance. The man Jerry is speaking to is wearing a dressing gown and a funny little hat - possibly Scottish. The man says: \"I want you to paper the parlour.\" Jerry nods and replies: \"I'll be on the job in ten minutes!\" Jerry attempts to put a wallpaper table together. Slapstick stuff ensues. It keeps collapsing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Jerry Papered the Parlour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
