Their first day at work is awkward but polite, with Jack all too aware of Sueâ€™s privileged status as daughter of a well-respected general. This, however, will be no ordinary mission: as they train their sights on an unarmed terrorist suspect, a power struggle erupts between the smart, sophisticated Sue and the dogged, blue-collar Jack.","popularity":4.6,"poster_path":"/ucLmihl3unqzsvynSVnzNdQYgh0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44727,"logo_path":null,"name":"Khaos Digital","origin_country":""},{"id":3095,"logo_path":"/AgLxsYktHv5yKq8NCSyWBCvUFRp.png","name":"Whitewater Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The war of the future is up in the air","title":"Drones","video":false,"vote_average":4.722,"vote_count":27}
