A theatrical and cinematic social comment on US intervention in Vietnam, Brook’s film also reveals a 1960s London where art, theatre and political protest actively collude and where a young Glenda Jackson and RSC icons such as Peggy Ashcroft and Paul Scofield feature prominently on the front line. Multi-layered scenarios staged by Brook combine with newsreel footage, demonstrations, satirical songs and skits to illustrate the intensity of anti-war opinion within London’s artistic and intellectual community.","popularity":0.678,"poster_path":"/txMXsfTgx1lJKRacbkAWHgpxQCn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Peter Brook’s provocative anti-Vietnam War 1960s protest piece.","title":"Tell Me Lies","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
