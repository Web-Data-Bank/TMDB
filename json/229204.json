A chance meeting with a woman named Lynn Wyman (Cathy Lee Crosby), coupled with her recent nightmares and searing headaches (one of which has prompted a spectacular collapse at her local grocery store), lead Lynn to the inescapable conclusion that she is an amnesiac--and that she might be Abbie Stewart, who has another family in Fillmore County. Journeying to Abbie's hometown to learn the truth, our heroine is put off somewhat by the curiously mixed reaction of the man who might be her \"other\" husband, school principal Chase Stewart (Bruce Davison). The key to mystery may not be the surrealistic dreams experienced by Rebecca/Abbie, but instead that painful-looking gash in her head.","popularity":0.766,"poster_path":"/vZEM9ByJmQlcuJVVUbrOv5kzSLw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iris Films Production","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":86,"logo_path":null,"name":"Catfish Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10471,"logo_path":"/tHIwIKoXdLKA8Nt3XeRInh71OvD.png","name":"Columbia TriStar Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Memory in My Heart","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
