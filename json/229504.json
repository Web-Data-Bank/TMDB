She lives two miles from the nearest road, with no electricity or running water. The roof has collapsed. She is completely dependent upon herself in order to cope with her everyday life. Daina’s children have both emigrated, her son to Norway and her daughter to Italy. When she feels lonely, she goes to her husband's grave and sits there talking with him as if he were still alive. Road’s end is a both poetic and existential film about choices we make in life, about obstinacy, love and betrayal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9TeJPNV0YlKeJGhI7U2I2yiFfN5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemagi/Folkets Bio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2013-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story From Latvia","title":"Road's End","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
