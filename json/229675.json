With a lineup featuring Derek St. Holmes, the original vocalist &amp; rhythm guitarist for the Ted Nugent Band from the 70s, plus Greg Smith (ex-Rainbow) on bass and Dokken s Mick Brown on drums, Nugent is in classic \"Uncle Ted\" form on this new live release. This man has a rock n roll soul like no other. Nugent is pure Detroit Rock N Roll dynamite, infused with a bit of Motown &amp; blues. His guitar playing is superb and mind blowing. The man is a mad talent, no doubt and Ultralive Ballisticrock proves this beyond a shadow of a doubt.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t9tBQZDpG3fIC9k1G2PH74Yk8Ew.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ted Nugent - Ultralive Ballisticrock","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
