This style emerged in the slums and poor neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro, and is deeply associated with the lower social classes, but is gradually being accepted on higher social circles. The film is specially interested in women's participation, focusing on its major female stars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":93585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toscographics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2005-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm Ugly But Trendy","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
