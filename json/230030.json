Both patients -- chosen for their ability to talk before a camera -- and sponsors in the community at large are interviewed to promote the concept of the patients' re-integration into the outside world. Three men (Paolo, Angelo, and Marco -- a mentally handicapped youth) talk to the interviewers about their own perspectives, and while the success of the mentally handicapped working at one plant is illustrated, the implied excesses of hospitals run by the Catholic Church are also discussed. Filming was not allowed inside those institutions.\"","popularity":0.99,"poster_path":"/c0pkSwruTSiBACfw4Ddv9fGcXOH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114239,"logo_path":null,"name":"11 Marzo Cinematografica","origin_country":""},{"id":116511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Assessorato Provinciale alla Sanit√† di Parma","origin_country":""},{"id":116512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regione Emilia-Romagna","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1975-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fit to Be Untied","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":5}
