He joins the Democrats, Congress seat Beacon Hill's legendary rooster, House speaker Charles T. \"Chick\" Mudoon, who trusts the customary campaign debt check will reel the rookie in as another meek party soldier. However the naive, naturally noble new boy, who doesn't hesitate to single-handedly fight off two skinhead gay-bashers, has and follows his own conscience. He defeats Muldoon's dodgy attempts to prevent a congressional committee investigating state police school cadet abuse, which would compromise his deputy, majority leader Spanky Reardon. It seems Muldoon's revenged when Dylan gets framed for the alleged violent abuse of a two-faced congressional aid. However, there's a more devious, ambitious plot behind two abuse cases and a staged corrupt payment for a memorial hospital wing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beacon Hill","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2}
