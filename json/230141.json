The story centres on Lian, a young 16-year-old from Malacca, who gets a job as a recep-tionist at the Sin-Sin Hotel. It’s the home of a gaggle of drag queens, all of whom have stories of broken hearts and drunken sailors. Lian learns more about life, lipstick and eyeliner than most—mainly from Drago, a Paris-based drag queen, back in town to look after her ailing mother.","popularity":1.376,"poster_path":"/1FBplCLmhkWZK8q7kc9ePyR0pOL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175879,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jaytex Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":78165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Far-Sun Film Company","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1995-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Find my true love.","title":"Bugis Street","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":6}
