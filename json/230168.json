Handsome middle class Manuel, hurt by his previous relationship and bored being alone, meets Julio, a rugged, lonely, unemployed young man in a chat room. The two eventually meet up in person and the sexual spark is quickly ignited. And while sex is satisfying and frequent, it is their collective problems with intimacy, trust and the fear of being hurt that make them hesitant to commit fully. As their relationship develops, both reveal secrets from their past but these revelations might be real, imagined or outright lies. Who is being truthful, who is real, and who truly loves the other? All is revealed in this romantic, passionate drama/thriller that offers a shocking, strangely satisfying conclusion.","popularity":3.011,"poster_path":"/rnNNgQgfJmmWlethoJKC2HsdXDt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17314,"logo_path":"/aw1N3ifCj5orNj7CbTBwVeMdpO9.png","name":"Swift Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2013-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who are you hooking up with tonight?","title":"Solo","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":35}
