Nienke's mission: to pluck Liz Burch from obscurity and give her a starring role in her debut film! This coming-of-age-story deals with the appeal of a character in a TV drama to a young lesbian and the excitement of meeting your childhood idol. But it's also about the pain of growing up, and what happens when fantasy and reality coincide. With animation, blue-screen, archive material and clever editing between Flying Doctors episodes and real life, the film pushes the boundaries of reality and fiction. Fan is a cheerful, poignant and fascinating self-portrait full of self-depreciating humor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
