Each of them has a very difficult family situation. During a long, intense night, eating, dancing and talking seriously, the young people make an ideal pact of love and friendship in the name of freedom, of a dream, of the hope for a better future. As in a new Decameron, modern rebels against the oppression, traditions, sexism and homophobia that permeate their society. But the violence of the real world breaks in on their splendid isolation. The first Lebanese gay movie, which was censored in its country of origin. This film combines different genres and styles: a Bollywood style format full of songs, choreographies and colours, but also a powerful melodrama, alternating moments of comedy and dramatic elements.  A manifesto of liberty and emancipation, with a cast of actors as stunningly beautiful as fashion models.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8698swagMPyryxfUXutZDCnTSv5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2011-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out Loud","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
