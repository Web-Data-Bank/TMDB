The award-winning work is the only filmed record of the invasion. Oratorio for Prague began as a study of the liberalization of Czechoslovakia and then continued when the Russian forces moved in. The gripping footage was broadcast by television, providing the first report of the event. In addition to the news footage, the film features never-before-viewed scenes taken prior to the invasion that crushed Prague's anti-Communist movement.","popularity":1.162,"poster_path":"/97jAPUCDK0QGtKdaf4Ej6F74iGo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gulfilms Houston","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oratorio for Prague","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":9}
