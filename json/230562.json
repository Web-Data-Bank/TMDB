The one common thing that binds them loosely together is the love that their mother Dolores \"Loleng\" Rosales holds for all of them and her grandchildren, albeit expressed in varying ways and degrees, but always equally nurturing and self-giving. Much as they are held together by her, they are in turn separated by physical distance and the sad legacy left behind by their deceased, erstwhile strong-willed, patriarchal father.","popularity":1.247,"poster_path":"/3UbZUv7qhjsSjkoIZMMuZHC3YgK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4676,"logo_path":"/fu7gOKwS2l2fiFlEQFamITFEWDk.png","name":"Star Cinema â€“ ABS-CBN Film Productions","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2000-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tanging Yaman","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
