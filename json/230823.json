Indeed, he used to live there before his wife disappeared at sea, never to be found again. As the ocean rejects a new corpse everyday, the mystery thickens and the list of potential suspects grows longer. This slows Molinat's progress as much as the cumbersome Leroyer, sent in to spy on him and hopefully impede his progress. The tension mounts and the ring involving the three young ladies in the grey mansion, the village idiot and the real estate agent starts spinning out of control.","popularity":1.486,"poster_path":"/3Xv7Kf9H3LzmfT0MdIBPHEJq5hu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Generale d'Images","origin_country":""},{"id":26194,"logo_path":null,"name":"FR3 Films Production","origin_country":""},{"id":255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradis Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8927,"logo_path":null,"name":"L.P.
