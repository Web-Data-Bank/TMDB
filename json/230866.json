From Gulf to Gulf to Gulf is a result of four years of dialogue, friendship and exchange between CAMP and a group of sailors from the Gulf of Kutch. Their travels and those of co-seafarers from Sindh, Baluchistan, and Southern Iran through the gulfs of Persia and Aden show us a world cut into many pieces, not easily bridged by nostalgics or nationalists. Instead, we follow the physical crossings made by these groups of people who make and sail wooden boats and who also make videos, sometimes with songs married to them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aOMRSsP84Objn4LG1XbTXEjruY6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sharjah Art Foundation","origin_country":"AE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"YE","name":"Yemen"},{"iso_3166_1":"SO","name":"Somalia"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"OM","name":"Oman"},{"iso_3166_1":"KW","name":"Kuwait"},{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"},{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"}],"release_date":"2013-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Gulf to Gulf to Gulf","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
