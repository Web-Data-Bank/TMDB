This thrilling 16-song set, recorded in awe-inspiring High-Definition for the PBS concert series Soundstage, proves the band to be more powerful and explosive than ever. Singer Kelly Hansen and lead guitarist Mick Jones are a wicked combination on songs like \"Hot Blooded\" and \"Double Vision\" along with favorites such as \"Cold As Ice,\" \"Juke Box Hero\" and \"Urgent\" as well as their newest single \"Too Late.\"  No one infuses power ballads with the blues quite like Foreigner, and the band breaks out its best in this entry in the SOUNDSTAGE series.
