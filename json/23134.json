Preacher won't let you dance? Well then, put Baby in the corner and come on down, 'cause VH1 is bringing back more of the'80s you love in this feature-length film, Totally Awesome. The Gundersons have just moved across the country and the kids - Charlie, Lori, and Max - are trying their best to acclimate themselves into a new school and all kinds of dilemmas therein: the need to dance, the pitfalls of young love, the quest for popularity, scientific genius and of course the quirky but loveable Japanese gardener. Totally Awesome takes all your favorite '80s-flick mainstays and weaves them into the biggest and baddest plotline ever conceived. Tot say it is radical would be an understatement.","popularity":3.413,"poster_path":"/gwMNeBxwTzeSmLXjoV1Y0E8bhQm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Awesome Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":308,"logo_path":"/e8F3mQM7DkJ5SfYYDp8FYzPBOGX.png","name":"The Weinstein Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":787,"logo_path":"/cCefBs1t7jxtiz3eCxBp9yxrxGx.png","name":"3 Arts Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":38007,"logo_path":null,"name":"VH1 Original Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where the dancing is dirty, the pink is pretty, and the foot runs loose.","title":"Totally Awesome","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":21}
