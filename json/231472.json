The third directorial effort of Jari Halonen, a clearly distinctive voice in the local filmmaking landscape, is a timeless, absurd and at times completely insane piece of masculine comedy rough not only on the edges, but to the core. A story of Mike, just out of prison, and his buddies throwing a Christmas party under the most obscure circumstances is filled with juicy dialogue and plot twists that will definitely make your jaw drop – and have you chuckle for days after.","popularity":1.704,"poster_path":"/nBTDWA54R0heqyjtyyMMxF55PiF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seppä Callahanin Filmimaailma Oy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1996-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Christmas is a family party.","title":"The Christmas Party","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8}
