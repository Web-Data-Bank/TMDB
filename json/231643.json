Rather than list matches, here were the finalists for each title. The US Championship contenders were The Wall, Sting, Scott Steiner, Ernest Miller, Mike Awesome, Booker, Billy Kidman, and Vampiro. Tag Team Championship contenders were Harlem Heat 2000, Shane Douglas & Buff Bagwell, Team Package (Flair & Luger), The Harris Brothers, and The Mamalukes.
