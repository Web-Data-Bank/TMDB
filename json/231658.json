The main event was initially Jeff Jarrett versus Hulk Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, however a second world title match was held impromptu later in the evening. This has often been debated as to if it was a scripted event by Russo or not. Also on the card was Goldberg vs Kevin Nash, Buff Bagwell vs Shane Douglas, Vampiro vs The Demon in a Graveyard match, Scott Steiner defending the WCW United States Championship against Mike Awesome, Booker T vs Kanyon, The Perfect Event (Shawn Stasiak & Chuck Palumbo) defending the WCW World Tag Team Titles against KroniK, Ms. Hancock vs Daffney in a Wedding Gown match, Big Vito vs Norman Smiley & Ralphus for the WCW Hardcore Championship, and Lt. Loco defending the WCW Cruiserweight Championship against Juventud Guerrera.","popularity":1.355,"poster_path":"/ogC3YL1SZ0pexHcDFUUVLAo336x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13510,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Championship Wrestling (WCW)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WCW Bash at the Beach 2000","video":true,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2}
