The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 3. President Roosevelt in his carriage, with mounted escort, passing up Market Street. A good picture of the President, and a spirited subject throughout.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1903-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The President's Carriage","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
