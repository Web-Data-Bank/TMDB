The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 5. President Roosevelt on the Reviewing Stand. This is a great film. It shows the President as he is entering the reviewing stand, follows him to the reviewing position, and then gives a swinging panorama of Union Square, with its immense throng of spectators.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1903-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panorama, Union Square, San Francisco","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
