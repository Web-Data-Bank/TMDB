The film is about a minute long, and for probably fifty seconds of that one minute we gaze blankly at the puddle. An occasional breeze causes its surface to ripple. The trees on the other side of the puddle can be seen reflected in the water. Nothing happens. Then more nothing happens. Then a bit more nothing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1903-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Mail Coach at Ford, U.S.P.O.","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
