A flotilla of canoes passes by. Some have one occupant, some two, a few three or four. Some men wear ties, a few wear boaters. Only a handful of the canoes have more than one paddler. None go quickly. There are more than 40 canoes packed close together. Off camera, down left, they seem to make a circle and head back to enter the frame from the left.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1904-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canoeing on the Charles River, Boston, Mass.","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
