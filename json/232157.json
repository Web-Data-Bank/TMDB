One morning, a cyclone hits his village and Dorothy has no time to take refuge in the family shelter. The cyclone takes it with the house to a faraway land, an unreal world populated by extraordinary characters. As soon as she arrives, she has only one idea in mind, to go home to find her aunt. How do I do that? No one has the power to help her get home. No one except perhaps a strange and fantastic character who has lived for years in the Emerald City, the Wizard of Oz.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iz6x1ZZgPd2McChzvuXaqCBYX2V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
