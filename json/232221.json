This deluxe edition contains a CD and DVD of their 2007 performance in front of the world’s biggest metal show, Wacken Open Air. Front man Phil Rind states that this performance is their first in 10 years. Rind may have become heavier around the waist, as he candidly points out to the massive crowd, but time hasn’t trimmed the band’s sound, which has remained as heavy as their first recorded note in 1985.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6n3HNTHwVOJrm35Aah0HxD8ONwy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Reich: Live at Wacken","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
