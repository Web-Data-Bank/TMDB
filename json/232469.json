The film is about an idea as well as a man - the idea of free expression as the defining characteristic of the individual. Hentoff is a pioneering journalist who raised jazz as an art form and was present at the creation of 'alternative' journalism. 'Pleasures' wraps the themes of liberty and identity around a historical narrative that stretches from the Great Depression to the Patriot Act. With a mix of interviews, archival footage and music, it employs a complex non-linear structure to engage the audience in a life of independent ideas and the creation of an enduring voice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pleasures of Being Out of Step","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
