The film is about Earth, about working with Earth, sacred to the indigenous people. An account of beauty that silences, of friendliness, also grief.” (Nestler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/95ZBpy6iLowXlSzcpTZkA99lJ5c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pachamama: Our Land","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
