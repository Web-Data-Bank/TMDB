Edison envisaged combining the phonograph with motion pictures even before they had been perfected and there is a test sequence from 1895. By the time this 'phonoscene' had been made, Alice Guy had been directing a series of them and there was a series in production in Germany, too. Yet true synchronization remained a problem, what with records wearing out and film breaking until the perfection of sound on film itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sHgwjJ7YUDdvNVD0HcQm8jVwIRD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1906-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anna, what are you waiting for?","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
