The film is a cruel parody on Danish producer Ole Olsen's \"LÃ¸vejagten\" (1907) which was at the time banned in Denmark (due to the fact that a lion and other animals were actually killed in the film) but shown in Sweden. In the student version two actors dressed up as a lion and a kangaroo get shot by hunters, but the hunters themselves soon get arrested by the police, an allusion to a recent conflict between the students and the local police.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1908-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lejonjakten.","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
