Unable to agree, each goes to a sculptor's studio and bribes him to sculpt a bust of the individual favorite. Instead, the sculptor spends their fees on a dinner with his model during which he becomes so inebriated that he is taken to jail. There he has a nightmare, wherein three busts are created and animated from clay (through stop-motion photography) in the likenesses of Democrat William Jennings Bryan and Republicans Charles W. Fairbanks and William Howard Taft. Finally an animated bust of Roosevelt appears.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q26pCxxqYfgHijXXUBJqTbfheZj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope \u0026 Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1908-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sculptor's Nightmare","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
