The phenomenal success of last year’s ‘Year of the Farmer’ celebration has convinced the festival director, Robin Yetman, and his committee to turn the festival into an annual three day event.  This year’s event will be called The Patchewollock Music Festival and run for 3 days from 18th-20th October. The Friday 18th evening will be the inaugural showing of 50 shades of grey. 50 shades of grey will showcase the early history of the district with black and white pictures of the early days being projected onto the side of a semi trailer taut liner parked outside the hotel on the main street. The photos will include early machinery, sheep sales, channels, dust storms, local identities and sporting activities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patchewollock Music Festival - Historical DVD","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
