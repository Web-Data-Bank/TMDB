He's wearing a bow tie, a white on white shirt, and a sweater. First he plays the guitar, which is lying across his lap - it's a steel guitar sound using a slide in his left hand. Next he picks up the ukulele for an up-tempo number. After a few choruses, he stops and adds a mouth organ, playing it while both hands continue to play the uke. He finishes with a piece on a four-string banjo. With all three instruments, he gets percussive as well as melodic effects. Roy smiles a lot but doesn't say or sing a word.","popularity":0.674,"poster_path":"/6GRd25GXbLrmxfLCy8YXhk1mcym.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Pastimes","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
