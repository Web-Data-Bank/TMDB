Tense battle in front and behind the cameras between a journalist and a politician.  This is not a work on politics. Nor is it a story about journalists. It is not a reflection on the always convulsive relations between the media power and the administration. \"Desclassificats\" shows us the meeting of three characters with very opposite points of view on ethics, professional integrity and dignity of the individual.","popularity":1.13,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desclassificats","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
