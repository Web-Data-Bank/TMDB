The balance of the house is affected not only by the family that lives inside, but also their cow, dog, cat, a passing bird, and a man with a couple of sheep who returns in a car. The slopes of the hill themselves also seem rather slippery at times.","popularity":1.912,"poster_path":"/kfEugmHx7oZroE58vP8l8o6Gf0F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8212,"logo_path":"/pkWt7XNwx5GssnXmTsXLKNpalaH.png","name":"Folimage","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Ends of the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":7.16,"vote_count":47}
