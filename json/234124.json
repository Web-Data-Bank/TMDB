Something terrible has happened, the undead are out in force; roaming the streets and devouring all who get in their way. A group of soldiers, civilians and teenagers take shelter in a local school for protection from the undead hordes outside, but no rescue is coming. Food is running low - morale doubly so, tensions are high and things are looking bad when a stranger arrives outside the gate. Then they get a whole lot worse.","popularity":2.397,"poster_path":"/bi3CVBr4E0syqy6xhZewTGZnSCh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18081,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hundy Gilbert Media Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Get Out Before They Get In","title":"The Dead Inside","video":false,"vote_average":3.875,"vote_count":16}
