He finds the spy \"disguised\" (with his head upside down) but Willoughby uncovers the \"disguise\" and gives chase. Agent X-13 ends up at the train station and riding the Orient Express. The Inspector follows with the agent using a variety of schemes to do away with Willoughby. He notices a downhill grade and sends a safe sliding down to crush the Inspector but the grade becomes an uphill grade and the safe ends up crashing into X-13. X-13 tries feeding him several poisonous foods and Willoughby's stomach turns out to have a trap door. Finally, Willoughby and X-13 battle on top of the train with X-13 leaping from the train to avoid hitting a tunnel and lands in Willoughby's net, then finding himself tied to a scale after going through the tunnel. The Inspector, having captured the crook, exclaims, \"That's what I call apprehending crime on a big scale!\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phoney Express","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
