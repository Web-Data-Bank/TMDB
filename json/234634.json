You’ll become that annoying person that sits your friends down to watch it, only to irritatingly nudge them in the ribs again and again whispering “this is a funny bit”.  Danny Bhoy, Live at Festival Theatre is the Scottish-recently-turned-Australian citizen’s fourth DVD, and like its predecessors is full of hearty laughs and some very quotable lines.  The performance shot in his “hometown” Edinburgh covers a range of topics from Scottish soccer, to sexting, gay Vikings and an encounter with Matt Damon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/11ewQ7pLtEV6mRKNmb9nnKc08uk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Danny Bhoy: Live at the Festival Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
