The show actually starts with a great joke on the audience: Boy George, looking not a day over 20, glides onstage in his once-trademark derby and beaded hair extensions, delivering a warm and welcome vocal on \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?\" The startled crowd soon realises he's an impersonator. The real, fortysomething George O'Dowd, looking a lot less androgynous and a tad thicker than in his New Romantic days, smiles self-deprecatingly and launches into a pleasing set of white soul (\"Cold Shoulder\", \"Miss Me Blind\"), stark gospel (\"That's the Way\"), stirring raga-rock (\"Bow Down Mister\") and even a classic (a lovely cover of Bowie's \"Starman\", complete with audience participation and muscular guitar by Roy Hay). It's a fine show all around.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9R2nVqN4gGWbHO1axis79FDGJ1O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Culture Club Live At The Royal Albert Hall 20th Anniversary Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
