The boy's mother is a flight stewardess, hence often away, and so Dajun's chubby cousin Yifen is often hired in as a child-minder. The relationship between Dajun and Yifen is, to say the least, abrasive, and Yifen bitterly resents being imposed on--especially when it seems that her own family is keen to get rid of her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ytdf0c5EkvM56sOaLEKiP8G0mSh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rice Film International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2004-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bear Hug","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":4}
