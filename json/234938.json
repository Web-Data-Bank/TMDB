Each story occurs at a specific mealtime, and seeks to interpret the frailties and complexities of love through different Asian perspectives. All three stories are tethered with the question, \"Will you marry me?\" Mirroring the repasts themselves, Breakfast and Dinner are heavier in tone, while Lunch is light with a sprinkle of humor.","popularity":0.713,"poster_path":"/iI8uWKoWVAebfZe5jlSDqSZde8F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119681,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wormwood Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2010-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breakfast Lunch Dinner","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
