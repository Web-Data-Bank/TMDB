Behind, an accumulation of sounds and images, where things are losing their name. A train takes us far away. To Mongolia. On the way, unknown faces, new melodies, gestures that fuse with the landscape. Being in a strange land, moving with it. With each step, our destination vanishes and pushes us forward, revealling the sense, that has always been there, that emerges through the mere existence: A land that, by undressing itself, fills up and inhabitates us. And from here, maybe, recover that place from which to look again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2009-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Catal√†"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La terra habitada","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
