When Miles Langford, the head of Kennedy High School, decides to take his school back from the gangs, robotics specialist Dr. Robert Forrest provides \"tactical education units\". These are amazingly human-like androids that have been programmed to teach and are supplied with devastatingly effective solutions to discipline problems. So when the violent, out-of-control students of Kennedy High report for class tomorrow, they're going to get a real education... in staying alive!","popularity":9.7,"poster_path":"/5HkKJhPODjCjVOoGcvHvo7tRgNU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lightning Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Original Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":12360,"logo_path":"/EugVVMfcbv9zxCr0C60VhD0vGY.png","name":"Vestron Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-04-01","revenue":2459895,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The ultimate teaching machineâ€¦ out of control.","title":"Class of 1999","video":false,"vote_average":6.044,"vote_count":182}
