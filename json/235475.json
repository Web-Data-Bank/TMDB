Fortunately, there are also some vicious underworld characters on hand so that we can still have the traditional Thai movie finale in which the Thai police show up en masse to shoot the hell out of some people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Sep07aNL2qkVHrLFccvR3CQ6w0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"1970-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
