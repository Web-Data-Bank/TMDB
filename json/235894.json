Katnip cats a worm-baited hook into the fishbowl, but Finny puts on a napkin and eats the bait with a knife-and-fork. The cat-vs.-fish chase continues until Finny ends up in a bottle of wine, and Katnip quickly drinks the contents of the bottle, including little Finny. Katnip burps up Finny, and both the cat and fish end up as intoxicated buddies.","popularity":1.388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feast and Furious","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
