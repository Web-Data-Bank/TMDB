They encounter Sylvester and chase him into a junkyard, where a black panther that escaped from a zoo just happens to be hiding out. Every time Spike goes into the junkyard to thrash Sylvester, he is clawed into pieces by the panther, which he, in a dark maze of crates, thinks is Sylvester. Chester has no problem pummelling Sylvester before Spike's eyes, which convinces Spike that Chester must be tougher than him.","popularity":1.007,"poster_path":"/6UdovbTuOi8kfD8X69bIlc3qxDc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tree for Two","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":12}
