But not just of show business-of life. In two days, he's going to kill himself. But in true Hollywood style, he's hired a film crew to chronicle his last moments and the events leading up to them; it's the role of a lifetime.  Often ironic and darkly comical, this is the story of a man searching for meaning and hope. This is the story of two days in the life of Paul Miller. The only question is, will they be his last?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/vub2qk8fycFju9wl6rGfBLVbLSr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Film is a dying art.","title":"Two Days","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":12}
