He catches the first blackbird that comes along, which happens to be Buzzy the Crow (not to be confused with Walter Lantz's Buzz Buzzard), who not only talks like Rochester but is nearly as smart as Rochester. Buzzy, smart enough not to want to be eaten, convinces the dumb cat that he has better methods of curing his insomnia, and then proceeds to severely punish the cat with a variety of all painful, sleep-inducing tricks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sock-a-Bye Kitty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
