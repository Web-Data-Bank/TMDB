The Captain, armed with a board, is standing guard (but not fixing the fence). He falls asleep, and the poultry attack, stripping the garden methodically. When the Captain comes after them, they lock him into a shed. He gets out, and fetches his shotgun. That stops them, and they drop their booty, until the Captain sets his gun down to collect the veggies; the birds all rush in, snatch them back.","popularity":0.741,"poster_path":"/i1WncJPWpzEYGB8yK0gCykcD8Rs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poultry Pirates","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
