He takes it home, but Mama is less than thrilled; she forbids it to stay in the house. The Captain pretends to put it out, but hides it under his coat. At the dinner table, though, it is soon exposed. Confined to the back yard, the dog howls the night away. The Captain is sent outside to quiet it, but is too tired to make it out the door. He finally gets there and sneaks the dog back inside to his own bed.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/lTMSfYFpx0W88EjnO5qx1Pyx7ly.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Captain's Pup","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
