As the music picks up, we see a water wheel, then a dancing fairy emerges from a whirlpool and begins singing, to the delight of small woodland creatures. The birds awaken sleeping cherubs, who begin their work of harvesting all things blue and adding them to the river. The birds even do their part, harvesting the color blue from the rainbow. Everyone tugs to open a floodgate and unleash the cerulean waters. A swan, festively decorated, leads a gondola of sorts lit by fireflies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pRMHX7FFtxqNxNTaQDXc74xoXAJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1939-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Danube","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
