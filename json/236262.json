Momma sends him to bed, where he dreams of venturing out. He sees a sign looking for boys, no experience needed. It's Fagin's school, where he trains boys to steal. The cops raid the place. In the shootout, the phone rings; Fagin answers and passes the message on to a cop: bring home a pound of butter. Blackie dives out a window, gets tangled up in a curtain, and wakes up, tangled in his blanket; he runs downstairs and joins in \"Three Little Kittens.\"","popularity":0.901,"poster_path":"/1JpOnLnCxsECrdfckvvATG0cU6Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1939-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fagin's Freshman","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
