Sharon hates her life there. She dreams of moving to Toronto - where her now deceased mother was from - to eke out a better life for her and Bayo. She even leaves her big black packed trunk in the middle of the foyer as a symbolic gesture that that move will soon be happening. She equally hates her fisher father, Phillip Longlan, for subjecting her and her mother to life there. Phillip, who spends most of his time on a commercial fishing boat, only provides Sharon enough money to survive but not to achieve that dream of leaving. Bayo, however, doesn't want to leave, especially leave his grandfather behind. He wants to live and die by the sea, much like his deceased father, who he never knew.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":"/kZ2Da5m9N7BJkOzU18CQUe6asf3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's a time for talkin'...and there's a time for doin'...and there's a time for leaving!","title":"Bayo","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
