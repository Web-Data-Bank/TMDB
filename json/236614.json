A hunter uses a moose call; the moose answers back using a hunter call. A barber uses an invention to startle a boy. A man uses a rear-view mirror to guard his hat while eating, but that's not all he should have guarded. In a laboratory, we see how rabbits multiply: 2x2=4, etc. Fireflies are having a blackout. An artist uses his thumb to get the proportions correct as a model is posing. A baby chick follows along as ducks take their first swim. In the South, the traffic signs read \"No U-All Turns.\" A baseball pitcher throws a dollar across the Potomac, but it gets only halfway; his Scotty dog explains that a dollar doesn't go as far. A fox hunt: the dogs run in circles, because the lead dog is romancing the fox. A new department store is about to be built, and it's already attracted a protestor. Finally, we see a series of battleships, all in the rain except the U.S.S. California, in bright sunshine.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/cvqncrfCoZjToyIk8LNCKraGTrk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nutty News","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
