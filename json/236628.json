Unable to stop his hiccups, Daffy decides to seek medical help, in a old house belonging to a Dr. Jerkyl, who advertises his services on a neon sign atop his house. Examining the hiccupping Daffy, Jerkyl decides to use a \"scare cure\" and chemically transforms himself into a goofy lug named Chloe, to whom Daffy had been assigned to deliver the message- a birthday greeting. Chloe chases Daffy around the house, until Daffy uses a syringe to squirt formula into Chloe's mouth, transforming him into a mischievous infant.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":"/xnOXxPkR1YhWici5s16BNmctpgj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Impatient Patient","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":8}
