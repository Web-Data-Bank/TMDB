He is sent to room 13, where his professor befuddles him with a tricky doorknob. Next, he goes to a tea party with his professor loosely disguised as an old lady; the butler serves a pot of \"T.N.Tea\" even though his back is full of knives. The professor keeps disappearing; the student tracks him by his footprints, even though the footprint powder at one point becomes train tracks and the doors he opens have a skeleton and some card-playing ghosts. Finally, the budding detective phones for the police; when they arrive (driving on the phone lines) and pile into the phone booth, he passes, and is given the first, second and (under bright lights) third degree.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1943-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vitamin G-Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
