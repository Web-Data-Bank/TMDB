With a pit bull’s passive aggressiveness, Lee pokes fun at pretentious DIY video-making culture by creating a character who is both an unwilling participant and an annoyed observer of a ridiculous project that will surely bring her very little in return, let alone love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We must all own up to our moral sleaze.","title":"Moral Sleaze","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
