After a short pause, the Red Army is preparing to advance, but on one segment of the front there are two serious obstacles: an unnamed hill with unknown German strength, and a highly skilled German sniper, who is killing off not only Russian officers, but also all captured German officers before they can be interrogated. Because of this, the local commander, Major Inozemtsev, suspects that the hill is a trap, which the Germans are very eager to keep a secret.","popularity":2.029,"poster_path":"/8vq5q9sl7Bkwbt3dG1amaIMi6cr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69587,"logo_path":"/u0Jy8wJ05m3MZCNiba1EXgf0zoK.png","name":"Russia-1","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":3419,"logo_path":"/byrxE2pJD9JLyBCIzyK0pYVanyG.png","name":"Central Partnership","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2004-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":196,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Nameless Height","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":10}
