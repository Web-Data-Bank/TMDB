The film is about the Robert Mitchell Boy Choir, consisting entirely of boys aged 8 to 14. The choir, run by organist Robert Mitchell, appeared in Hollywood productions for over thirty years. Accordingly, the boys were recruited to go to a special school where they would go through regular classroom instruction until 1 PM, after which they'd do choir practice. The kids are also shown performing in a church on Sunday as well as camping, as they are all part of the same Boy Scouts troop. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Subject, One-Reel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/829uX31T8XrSARaMnGBr0VtrAa5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
