She throws them out, so they scheme to hurt themselves enough to get hospitalized, with no luck. Bluto gets a wall to fall on him, but stands in the window. Popeye tries to get run over by a steam-roller, but a street cleaner saves him. Bluto dives off a skyscraper - into a huge pile of mattresses. Popeye stands in a naval gunnery range, but the gunners miss the target. Bluto taunts a bull, but stands next to a billboard of an attractive cow, which distracts the bull. Popeye crashes a plane, but the ambulance crew rescues the plane. The boys compete to get run over by a train, but punch each other off the tracks just as the train arrives. Finally, Popeye forces a can of spinach down Bluto's throat and gets a pounding. That lands him in the hospital but not Olive's; they failed to notice the sign: \"Cat and Dog Hospital.\" They start fighting like cats and dogs, and get hauled off to the looney bin.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/lvm5x47eaC0WsEQ8tvfHys5ID9o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1945-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Better or Nurse","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
