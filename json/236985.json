Bluto covets Popeye's assistant Olive. Popeye sticks his head in a lion's mouth, but Bluto has put a steak on Popeye's head. When he gets out of that, he does his high wire act: carrying a piano, and Olive, blindfolded. Bluto sabotages this with a banana peel and tosses Popeye to the monkey cage, while he has his way with Olive - until Popeye eats his spinach.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fxX2WST8RVBe3DWFRkf64d9vunU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tops in the Big Top","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
