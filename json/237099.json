She wanders off to stalk a chimp, and happens across Bluto as a Tarzan-like character. She's smitten, as is he, so he shows off a bit. Popeye finally catches on, and they start the usual round of fighting and one-upmanship. Bluto summons a wide array of animals, and while Popeye's occupied, hauls Olive high into a treehouse. With some help from the chimp, Popeye has his spinach and turns most of the animals into fur coats (on a rack the chimp pushes through the melee), then rescues Olive by hauling on the tree's roots until she's at ground level.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u9wXq1tyeKs4LQWy0Zs5GzpJvze.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safari So Good","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
