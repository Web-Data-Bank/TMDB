A high-ranking Nazi officer developed a plan to assassinate the three world leaders in order to undermine the Allied forces. He commissioned the German agent Max Richard to carry out his plan, but it failed miserably due to the quick action and thinking of Andrei. While in Teheran, Andrei met a French woman, Marie Louni, living in the city and they had a brief but intense affair. Nearly four decades later, the Nazi officer has been captured - but not for long. Freed by terrorists, the officer is hunting down the German agent who failed to carry out the planned assassinations. Max lives at Françoise, a young French woman, who hides him.","popularity":2.641,"poster_path":"/lQK5yXlwUqRCWEAj976h6JEG9tQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10459,"logo_path":null,"name":"Méditerranée Cinéma","origin_country":""},{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1981-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":192,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teheran '43","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":18}
