A trumpeting seal holds out a sign reading \"Petrillo Says Two Fish\" (a reference to American Federation of Musicians president James C. Petrillo). The main attraction, a man on a flying trapeze, swoops down into the audience and picks up a beautiful girl. Watch for a cameo appearance by Blackie the Lamb, who kills the man on the flying trapeze at the end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Circus Comes to Clown","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
