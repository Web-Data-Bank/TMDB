They stop to fill the camel with water and freshen up a bit; Olive muses aloud that she'd like to kiss a sheik. A sheik, looking a lot like Bluto, happens to overhear this and sets up a kissing booth. He carries her away to his luxurious tent. Popeye finally finishes up and notices Olive is gone; he chases after her, but his camel suffers a blowout. Meanwhile, the sheik has been wooing Olive. Popeye arrives, and after briefly sharing the hookah with the sheik, tries to leave with Olive. The sheik will have none of it; he wraps Popeye like a mummy and fires him with a cannon into the sphinx. Fortuitously, there's a can of spinach inside, and Popeye saves the day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qYOI9usBXFs89cjN6N97G5jTBRI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Wolf in Sheik's Clothing","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
