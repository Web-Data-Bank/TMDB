Olive almost ends up in the dinosaur, but the caveman (longing for a woman) saves her. Olive falls for him, but Popeye, noticing Olive's absence, comes down and saves her from the caveman. They fight it out; the caveman stuffs Popeye into a not-quite-empty spinach can and feeds him to the dinosaur, but of course, Popeye breaks out and wins the day.","popularity":0.876,"poster_path":"/txrlymP8H6v1GwGZizkH03et8AK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pre-Hysterical Man","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
