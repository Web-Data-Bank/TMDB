Harry kidnaps Pearl Pureheart's father, the Colonel, ties him with a boulder and drops him off the Brooklyn Bridge and into the East river teeming with hungry crocodiles, then he goes after Pearl. The cops were too late to stop him as Harry absconds with Pearl. Meanwhile, Mighty Mouse breaks free and clobbers the vultures, rescues the colonel and his daughter and defeats Harry once again. Lots of singing in this operetta! This cartoon was produced in that old radio serial style, with the announcer setting the scene and interjecting throughout.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vNPkATl6KkHwNaqccb6R7krNZVH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42019,"logo_path":"/mFPTppw3q4tY9R2b7QxVv4zevLi.png","name":"Terrytoons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triple Trouble","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
