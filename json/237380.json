Together, they shake a tree and a bounty of fruit falls. They gorge on the bounty, growing huge. They are tempted by a lovely woman; she drops the key to a door, which, when opened, reveals a live-action black-and-yellow montage of modern life (airplanes, traffic jams, etc.). A dispute between the two leads to another montage, this time scenes of war.","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":"/mtESVGLIwHzcUsWqBcAW90JJDhQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8298,"logo_path":"/r6cuEYq7DqrHCNVa7vSanTS0cuw.png","name":"Warner Bros.
