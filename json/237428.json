In this crudely rendered home video of a commune of stoned revolutionaries, the cameras are hand-held, the edits in-camera, and the dialogue is wryly on-target. Pettibon's band of outsiders reenacts a countercultural moment defined by rock music, drugs, and ideological paradox â€” and in so doing, captures their own late-80's West Coast grunge milieu as well.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/9zfiu6nluVwA71Y0x0lrNBNKAik.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Whole World is Watching","title":"Weatherman '69","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
