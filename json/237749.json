Starring Trecartin’s family and friends, and the artist himself in a plethora of outrageous roles, A Family Finds Entertainment chronicles the story of mixed up teenager Skippy and his adventures in ‘coming out’. In this over the top celebration of queerness, Trecartin’s film mines the bizarre and endearing in an unabashed pastiche of ‘bad tv’ tropes. Cheesy video special effects, dress-up chess costumes, desperate scripts, and ‘after school special’ melodrama combine in the fluency of youth-culture lingo, reflecting a generation both damaged and affirmed by media consumption.","popularity":0.891,"poster_path":"/25TUrBScZCZHq8FtX8gj7s6m709.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150341,"logo_path":null,"name":"XPPL","origin_country":""},{"id":20988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Arts Intermix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Family Finds Entertainment","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
