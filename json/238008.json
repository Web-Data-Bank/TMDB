The film includes accounts of the economic aspects of the camps' operation, the interrogation of captured camp personnel, and the enforced visits of the inhabitants of neighboring towns, who, along with the rest of their compatriots, are blamed for complicity in the Nazi crimes - one of the few such condemnations in the Allied war records.","popularity":1.415,"poster_path":"/czNHDfe6Ix0iquEPn6R6P8ldZob.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4223,"logo_path":null,"name":"U.S. Army Signal Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death Mills","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":10}
