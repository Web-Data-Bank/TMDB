For some reason, he believes that his larcenous ways will bring him prosperity in the country which at one time or another has had rulership over a large portion of the globe. While there, he meets Rosie McCratchit (Pamela McMyler), a lovely Irish gal who could do with some improvement in her fortunes as well. Together, they have a series of legal, quasi-legal and definitely illegal adventures, including Duke's cow-roping and Rosie's response to the mud-wrestling challenge of the Amazon Lady, as well as an attempted armored-car robbery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/duRUmKsl6yFnNWN52yWJBYejKsF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Backstage Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":18277,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trident-Barber","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stick Up","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
