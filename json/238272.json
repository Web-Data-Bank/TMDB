He hires young Estela in order to look after his tiranic and almost crazy grandmother. The differences in class and age don't stop Andres from courting Estela, whose fiancé Mario tries to make some money with the passions of his well-off rival. The suffocating atmosphere of the run-down mansion in the outskirts of Santiago represents the deterioration of the bourgeoisie, and sets the scene for the total collapse of Andres.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/nNtT3LQismxxecHM1YkTmI7HxzY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102417,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andrea Films","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2000-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coronation","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":10}
