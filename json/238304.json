Whether she's singing the National Anthem or promoting her latest album, everyone knows who she isâ€”none more so than New Jersey high school basketball coach and widower Chris Mitchell, who was Nikki's first love in high school. When Chris' 10-year-old daughter Sophie finds out her dad still has feelings for the singer, she takes matters into her own hands.
