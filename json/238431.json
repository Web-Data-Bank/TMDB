Another victim is filmed while bathing in a lake: 'Every time I smell their odour, I take a bath.' By expressing themselves and participating in support group meetings, raped Congolese women fight for recognition. At one meeting, men first point at the women's provocative clothing. But a soldier extends his support to the activists, just like a reverend does with a scathing sermon to his parishioners. The documentary switches back and forth between hope and sorrow. Two men took their wives back, one of them even participates in the information meetings now. But a young woman who tells about her rape will probably never get married. 'She will become a prostitute', her father sighs. The filmmakers meet with a condemned offender in jail, but he does not show any remorse.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting the Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
