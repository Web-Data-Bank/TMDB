Using a combination of archival footage, voice-overs and interviews with 15 unnamed academics, activists and political leaders, the film presents the directors' personal journey to come to an understanding of how their country arrived at its current state of near-constant political division and dysfunction.","popularity":0.774,"poster_path":"/7AOuWg5ylZe26bgVBUqvt9Xt5UA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tangkwa Matograph Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2013-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradoxocracy","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":6}
