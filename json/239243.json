He does not accept that Pif, this fleabag, can delight stardom. He decides, therefore, on an impulse, to change his life and retire to a deserted island- or the nearest thing: to relate his career and write his own film. In a paradise-like setting, Hercule recounts the biggest roles of his career. Pif isn't absent from his memories, but Hercule still considers him to be a fifth wheel... However, this, in reality, is not exactly the case.","popularity":1.15,"poster_path":"/AfvxFqLmigy2DBtEmpmUovqONGq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 1001 Gags of Spiff & Hercules","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
