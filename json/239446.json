Perhaps to characterize De Sade’s libertine philosophy and rude text as words and ideas worthy of anyone, Smolders alternates his actors, with several men portraying (presumably) the incarcerated De Sade. - kqek.com","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bFaeXsF9KTXPCkOuTfUXNevVmLr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La philosophie dans le boudoir","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
