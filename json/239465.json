The pace is slow with the intention of inviting viewers into a more visceral and less verbally analytical state of mind. The 'action,' small events like the mail arriving, the storm coming, and the grass getting mowed, are secondary to the way of perceiving those events.  In many ways this film reaches back into a kind of personal memory one might recall from early childhood.\" â€“Leighton Pierce","popularity":0.93,"poster_path":"/bwuw5kBPVl8lnt1OkMZZZcuSUWz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"50 Feet of String","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
