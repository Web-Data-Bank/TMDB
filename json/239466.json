The approach to image is very painterly with the simple view transformed “with Turneresque luminosity.” Most of the unusual visual effect is from the careful use of a shallow depth of field and natural objects (blowing grass, bushes, etc.) to bend and twist the images into a languid sense of time. In the end the film documents a state of mind more than a particular spot. It also resonates with the ambiguous metaphoric threat of a national symbol impinging upon the child’s toy.  - Canyon Cinema","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3cK6r9UGy7DCD1U2rgNFOtjSq34.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Shovel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
