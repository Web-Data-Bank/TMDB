Interviews with former members of Eoan, photos, newspaper clippings, sound recordings, archive footage of opera performances and street scenes featuring the residents of District 6 in Cape Town give an impression of the world in which these people lived. By paying attention to the way in which the documentary was made – to questions that were not asked and answers that were not officially given – the painful truth behind the images and faces is gradually revealed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Inconsolable Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
