Though shaky and handheld, it is an immediately recognizable and iconic image: the great vistas of Hollywood westerns, of American westward expansion, of monumental modernist land art from the late 20th century. On the soundtrack, Reinke’s unmistakable voice apologizes for beginning the film with a shot of a landscape from a moving car, but what is he to do? The camera is already rolling. This moment encapsulates much of what transpires in the scenes that follow: presenting us with an image, dismissing that image and wryly suggesting he is doing nothing here, that the footage is just unreeling. Reinke’s collection and organization of images and sounds seem casual at first, but ultimately reveal themselves to be heavily mediated and orchestrated.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tiny Ventriloquist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
