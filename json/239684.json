Maybe its a deliberate smokescreen given that politicians, rather than journalists or estate agents, are now the least respected and trusted of all professions. Boris Johnson is the only current politician in the country with a popularity above 1. Comedians have seen this and are standing to be politicians. Are you going to lie back and let the clowns take over? Are you going to stick your head under the duvet as Bozzer de Pfeffel Johnson rides his crazy zipwire into town? Mind you that duvet is warm and cosy, isnt it? And theres a cup of tea available. And a muffin. And a chocolate cupcake.","popularity":1.344,"poster_path":"/tuXOLjiDZxwflMvO9nkjAuMAHnE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andy Parsons - Slacktivist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
