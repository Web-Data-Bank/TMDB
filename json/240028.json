Drawing from her emotional experiences, she illustrates what it feels like to be “in the middle.” Employing rotoscopy, hand-drawn animation techniques and subtle stereoscopic 3D, the film captures Petra as she engages the camera with unflinching directness and dignity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petra's Poem","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
