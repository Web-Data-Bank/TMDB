He's a failed NYC indie rocker, and a failing booking agent. But he finds the potential of a small victory in a really bad idea. He decides to purchase a 1985 Lazy Boy on eBay, just like the one his dad had when Josh was a kid. He'll drive cross-country for the chair, staying with Emily at his brother's house on the way, and deliver it to his father as a surprise birthday gift. But when Rhett ends up coming along for the ride, it's three people and a giant purple puffy chair in a too-small van... and one of them has to go before the trip's end.","popularity":3.477,"poster_path":"/fybmkedrXx02p7i6TZMl9sC5NvM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1974,"logo_path":"/t8p2PpDBJo282a5TTr6Ln0wVkMZ.png","name":"Duplass Brothers Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Puffy Chair","video":false,"vote_average":5.987,"vote_count":39}
