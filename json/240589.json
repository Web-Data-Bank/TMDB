Horses still play a key role in Songpan, but a lot has changed since China opened its doors to the rest of the world. Stimulated by the authorities, tourism has grown into an important business. The inhabitants of Songpan discuss their situation for the camera, talking about money, or rather the lack of it. Tourism can be lucrative, but the rich are getting richer and the poor remain at least as poor. Apart from a South Korean immigrant who discusses her integration in Islamic culture, most people in Songpan concentrate on how to go about making a living. They talk about the price of things, how to get more tips from tourists, and how hard it is to save anything.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horsemen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
