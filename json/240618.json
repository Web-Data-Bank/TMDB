Corvettes first appeared there in June of 1960.  The film re-caps that historic race and what happened to both the Corvettes and their drivers.  Following the race, all the Corvettes were lost for decades.  Collectors, restorers and enthusiasts came to recognize the historical significance of these cars, and an undercurrent of frantic searching for them was put into motion.  THE QUEST reveals a series of sub-stories that all feed into the emotional tale of a son doing what he felt compelled to do in honoring his fatherâ€™s wish.  Told by many of the people directly involved, THE QUEST uses archival materials to weave a story never told in its entirety...until now.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Quest","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
