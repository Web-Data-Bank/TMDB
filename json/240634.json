From Atari to Angry Birds, How Videogames Changed the World explores how interactive entertainment evolved from a penny arcade diversion into a medium that some believe is art, and shows how it is changing the way we work, communicate and, of course, play.  Joined by Jonathan Ross, Dara O'Briain and gaming legends like Will Wright and John Romero, Brooker looks at how videogames have become the most progressive art form of the last 40 years.  This humorous and insightful tour will surprise and entertain the uninitiated and dedicated gamers alike.","popularity":2.204,"poster_path":"/tMNCdqj4G7h9rszii5i0EqcW7O7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18663,"logo_path":"/khiCshsZBdtUUYOr4VLoCtuqCEq.png","name":"Zeppotron","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Videogames Changed the World","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":28}
