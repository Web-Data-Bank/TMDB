One of the actresses is the lesbian Ana, who interprets the poet Mário de Sá Carneiro. She is Clara's friend and confidant with whom she shares an apartment. Clara does not perceive Ana's love for her, that always helps her to recover from the disappointments. Unlike the character Sá Carneiro, poet of decadentism, nostalgia, metaphysics and vague, Ana is the pragmatic side of Clara, who often brings a disillusioned vision as if it were Fernando Pessoa himself, who may be associated with concepts of the poet's heteronyms.","popularity":0.96,"poster_path":"/ubw3vMPePjsMVVDFIFRDHvPTVHX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haroldo Marinho Barbosa Filmes","origin_country":""},{"id":13930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Embrafilme","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baixo Gávea","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
