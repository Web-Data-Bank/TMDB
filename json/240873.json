All of them arrived in the big city, Prague, from their small home town. The euphoric dreams each had for themselves have not materialized and they are all starting to feel trapped in different ways. They all seem to know one thing: what they don't want in life. At a party back in their home town they reminisce over one of their early dreams: to buy a farm, live together and, most importantly, have fun with their lives. In the weeks that follow, each of them is faced with a crisis that brings this old dream into sharper, more sober focus. Can they make it a working reality? Do they really want to?","popularity":1.152,"poster_path":"/flNKfvSCkwa5oV78i0qa1sZC48M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2009-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreamers","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
