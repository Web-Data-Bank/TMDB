Despite his protests that this is money that he earned in the city, the villagers have their doubts. In fact, he held up a gas station and unintentionally killed its attendant, and is in hiding here. Meanwhile, he has married a woman (Mariam Kaba) with a child who left her husband and built a house for her. He is building a bar with his remaining money, but he encounters a situation which makes him believe that he will be exposed to the police, and runs away, leaving a pregnant, very ill wife behind, much to the disgust of the villagers and Samba's own family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/if9zY2Owd4tlBKoAFaRzXfSPgaa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waka Films","origin_country":""},{"id":875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films A2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":78115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films de L'Avenir","origin_country":""},{"id":78116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Avenir","origin_country":""},{"id":78117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Plaine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1993-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samba Traoré","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7}
