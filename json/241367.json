We are trying to focus more on how fun snowboarding actually is, not how hard it is. People can expect seeing their favorite Nitro riders riding stuff that the viewer hopefully can relate to more. Instead of only showing the best tricks on the perfect locations (we will show that as well), we are trying to show how the Nitro riders are snowboarding when all pressure is off. The goal is to capture that feeling you get when you are riding with your best friends, on a perfect day, and you never wanna stop riding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hyped!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
