The diary records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, Charles Pooter, his wife Carrie, his son Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances, over a period of 15 months. The hapless Victorian diarist records the minutiae of life in the suburbs with a dry wit, sarcasm and mostly misunderstood humour, as he battles with impertinent tradesmen, exasperating friends and his wayward son Lupin's various misdemeanours.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/yiwNg2YiiIzJGE7jH7CdEM6qxkK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Diary of a Nobody","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
