This DVD will show you how to use the 3 simple Motor Officer techniques the cops have been trained in for more than 60 years. Until now, these training secrets have not been available to the general public. I have developed a simple step by step procedure that will allow you to master the 3 Motor Officer techniques in just 3 to 4 hours. I know my step by step plan works because I've put hundreds of students through the exact course you'll see on this DVD. I use a modified version of the Police Motor Officer course that can be mastered in just 1 day. Even riders with 20 years of experience will improve their skills by 100%. I'll even show you the tricks to passing your State motorcycle endorsement test.","popularity":1.288,"poster_path":"/fKFpRQEjAv0Izugp7ZzsuYC6uDZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ride Like a Pro V","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":4}
