His wife and children ignore him; he's a mid-level government functionary in Montreal doing his job without care. He has an active imagination of sexual conquest, but his only real feelings come when he visits his aged mother, whose health is failing. When his wife leaves abruptly to work in Toronto, Jean-Marc sets out to reorder things with his daughters, his social life, and at work. In a world that at best is a farce, does he stand a chance?","popularity":3.677,"poster_path":"/syTfHveVRGPre7TT2D60UmQ8L2a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mon Voisin Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":280,"logo_path":"/1rwkrpgsc0pWmkvEOabbPzEsGLi.png","name":"Cinémaginaire","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":694,"logo_path":"/5LEHONGkZBIoWvp1ygHOF8iyi1M.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":803,"logo_path":"/jEMVaCuEjQ3lzkhakWDKNVjwd9Q.png","name":"Alliance Atlantis","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Days of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":56}
