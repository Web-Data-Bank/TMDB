Mostly on black space, the figures in blue perform a very compact and jewel-like opera in surreal form, again to Satieâ€™s piano music. Ideally, the film should be projected on a 30\" wide white card sitting on a music stand, center stage of a large auditorium or music hall, with sound from the projector piped into the big speaker system. The film is most effective this way, but can be shown normal-size also","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bvtedJGLXoUPCXgucalzOQzD1VO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carabosse","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
