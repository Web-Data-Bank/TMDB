Later, a Navy officer calls his friend Cal for help. A Colombian drug lord is holding the ambassador, and the officer wants Cal to rescue the man. Cal convinces the officer to get a pardon for imprisoned explosives expert Rick, and together Cal and Rick form an uneasy partnership. They travel to meet Yolanda, a stripper who supposedly knows the location of this drug lord, named Perez (who looks like a creation out of Madame Tussaud's). Our threesome then sets about to rescue the ambassador. Cal, Rick, and Yolanda meet resistance at every turn; apparently Perez's men have the drop on them. After multiple shootouts, Cal convinces Yolanda to use her son as a pawn to draw Perez away from his home, and then all hell breaks loose.","popularity":1.032,"poster_path":"/dB8Jn5HXR1zG7qpsLoRIKce5fjB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13282,"logo_path":null,"name":"21st Century Film Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":5268,"logo_path":null,"name":"Power Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":184381,"logo_path":null,"name":"Snizzlerfritz Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":11787,"logo_path":null,"name":"Po' Boy Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's Dangerous He's Destructive and he's dead serious.","title":"Three Days To A Kill","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
