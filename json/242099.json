Verbal testimony, photographs, manuscripts, images of Lisbon, Macao, Kobe and Tokushima in Moraes' time are set side by side with A ilha dos amores and with de Moraes' writings. The director, Paulo Rocha, visited places where Moraes was still remembered, interviewed the writers descendants, consulted archives, rummaged through memories, appointment books, postcards, diaries and calendars from the private life of the 19th century. And above all he set out on a new journey, from Lisbon to Macao to Kobe until he reached Tokushima, where Moraes lived through the final ruin of his life and where Rocha tracks down, between the city and the cemetery, the living presence of places and the memories of individuals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l0R9M2sDhlHuBgvI2yhb3gZlcWm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suma Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Ilha de Moraes","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
