Until the pattern is broken â€“ by faith, decision or coincidence. In Real Life is about such moments, where lives are drastically changed. As a multi-plot drama, created out of three years of acting improvisations, In Real Life follows three story threads with characters who come together by internet dating and by their persistent search for some kind of meaning in life between love and sheer survival.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/a2yK3IuVS5R6HyUkNpgf36Jz0ns.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8666,"logo_path":"/ivI7Rdt2gaH8VNeoIGtks3oRlzR.png","name":"Beofilm","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":188716,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bebopfilm ApS","origin_country":""},{"id":188717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sebasto Film \u0026 TV ApS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2014-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Real Life","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":9}
