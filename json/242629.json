In the aftermath of a robbery-murder, Galt follows the trail of evidence directly to his own son, Benjie. Sworn to uphold the law at all costs, Galt is grimly determined to see that Benjie will receive a fair trial without any coercion on his part. But the townsfolk have already decided that the sheriff will try to spring the boy, and a lynch-mob mentality slows festers its way through the community. As the trial proceeds, it becomes obvious that Benjie is going to hang for his alleged crime, but there's still one or two surprises in store.","popularity":1.42,"poster_path":"/f0I9TK53JLwAo9ryDWKQ0KqsLwZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grand Productions (I)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The whole town crawled under his gun...","title":"The Iron Sheriff","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
