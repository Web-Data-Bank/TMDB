Winwood's career follows a classic British rock star model, with his forming the short-lived supergroup Blind Faith in 1969 before getting it together in the country with Traffic, who melded rock and jazz with a pastoral sensibility that produced a classic version of the pagan ale celebration John Barleycorn. This profile shines a light on a life spent making tasteful, soul-tinged music.  From childhood prodigy to veteran master, Birmingham-born Steve Winwood's extraordinary career is like a map of the major changes in British rock 'n' roll and rhythm and blues from the 1960s to the present. This in-depth profile traces that journey and reveals a master musician blending Ray Charles and English hymnody into a unique brand of English soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wPzDPpEQtviS46KuVn6E6XrCFry.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steve Winwood: English Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
