It is when Ning is required by her new job to go on a road trip with Mur, a male Muslim colleague, that the suffocation of her marriage gives way to an awakening of repressed desires. Set in Yogyakarta, this delicately observed mood piece and debut feature touches on unspoken issues of sexual repression and adultery in contemporary Indonesia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5xt49FwSpWBUOY9hvaOFwbxVCNe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Limaenam Films","origin_country":"ID"},{"id":120015,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tembi Rumah Budaya","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2012-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Javanese","iso_639_1":"jv","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peculiar Vacation and Other Illnesses","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
