Governed by their overprotective boss, the girls' routine of glittery neon lights and lecherous customers is soon disrupted when an enigmatic stranger enters the scene. Now, drugs, sex and bickering all take a back seat as the girls unite to save this man haunted by a mysterious past and unforgiving demons. A fascinating glimpse into a world of back alleys and primal instincts, The Bathers transports us to a netherworld where the show always goes on.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/xDhWSLEXWfao3k9Kn2iQb3DXkyB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ognon Pictures","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bathers","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5}
