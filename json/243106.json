When he isn't working, he tinkers on a disabled car and dreams of a young girl who is a local student. After a few too many beers one night, he steals some money from the till at work. He is caught by the foreman, who beats the young man. Carl-Henning defends himself and knocks the man down a flight of stairs. Convinced he has murdered the man, Carl runs away and joins up with a traveling carnival. Although the foreman has only a slight bump on the head and all is forgiven, Carl never receives word he is welcome to return and begins a series of adventures that take him far beyond the farm.","popularity":0.741,"poster_path":"/lCAFIAkfwVXwrU1dRwtjxV8QXsE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3676,"logo_path":"/mel4PnFPw1LuxgzUJzoh7VxpIRq.png","name":"ASA Film Production","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1969-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballad of Carl-Henning","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
