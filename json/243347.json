Having been moved by the authorities to peripheral pockets and no manâ€™s lands outside the expanding city, the dogs are continuously moving along lines of gentrification and corporate city making. Through looping and repetition, Eriksson relates this process to an experience of time: exploring the present as a complex gap between past and future, one in which an increasing process of erasure, spurred on by a shrinking public realm, also removes other registers of being and seeing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I am the dog that was always here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
