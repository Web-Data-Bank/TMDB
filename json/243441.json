Minako has confessed her infidelity to her husband and informs him of her intention to leave him. She has ceased to enjoy living with a submissive husband. Minako, who works for a construction company, loves her job and is progressing in her successful career, while her husband eagerly takes care of the house and the kids. He buys groceries, he cooks, he does the laundry – constantly. The couple’s arguing intensifies until Minaka files for divorce. Their older daughter Mari isn’t that upset by her parent’s problems as she’s more interested in the piano piece she’s got to play with her mother at a concert organised by her music school; admittedly, she’s also rather interested in her music teacher. But her younger brother Toru feels betrayed by his mother and can’t manage to reconcile himself to his father’s role as a housewife. A partial reconciliation occurs at Minako and Mari’s concert, where their entrance on stage is met with loud applause.","popularity":1.47,"poster_path":"/7f30fvmwE6xBh6gqruJRYgdj80F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13411,"logo_path":"/yjF0FwJX69h0yGB6WvQwzUOzBln.png","name":"Hakuhodo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":9177,"logo_path":"/4J38yaZJMtU8fI1bxIdE9PHnGb7.png","name":"Eisei Gekijo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":13412,"logo_path":"/jLBwPLrniN24UV46WMtNTCTyd8c.png","name":"IMAGICA","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":4649,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sedic","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quartet for Two","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
