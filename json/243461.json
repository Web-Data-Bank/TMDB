Morgenstern’s presentation of the incident serves as a metaphor for the horror of the Holocaust, and provides a powerful trigger for discussion of the disturbing issues raised by the film. The figure of the children's’ teacher specifically parallels Janusz Korcak (1879-1942), a famous Jewish educator who ran an orphanage in the Warsaw ghetto and died with his young charges at Treblinka.","popularity":0.77,"poster_path":"/mnar5T7UwRttRh5jlK3BROsLsEK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Se-Ma-For","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ambulance","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
