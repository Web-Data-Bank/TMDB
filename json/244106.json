He weds Elisa Cegani, a servant girl, who turns out to be a more appealing wife than any of the others could have been. Assis Noris decorates the screen well as one of the chasers and pursuers. In 1937, De Sica and Noris made a film, \"II Signor Max,\" which, other than the setting and character role names, basically has the same plot as this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eX4aEIpuMFZda78QwwYdnMZ6zc6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"But It's Nothing Serious","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
