In Thailand, before every cinema film screening, there will be a Royal Anthem before the feature presentation. The purpose is to honour the King. It is one of the rituals imbedded in Thai society to give a blessing to something or someone before certain ceremonies. The Anthem presents a 'Cinema Anthem' that praises and blesses the approaching feature for each screening. This audio-visual purification process is performed by three old ladies. They also channel energy to the audience in order to give them a clear mind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":146328,"logo_path":null,"name":"MOCAtv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2006-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Anthem","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
