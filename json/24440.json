This innovative history programme is based around Robert Newman's stand-up act and supported by resourceful archive sequences and stills with satirical impersonations of historical figures from Mayan priests to Archduke Ferdinand.","popularity":1.022,"poster_path":"/eKllv5Hu0fpsg5oJePIvsvJUqAZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robert Newman's History of Oil","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":5}
