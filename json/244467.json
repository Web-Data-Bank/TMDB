Political intrigue abounds in a complex upside-down world as militia assassin Mike Wilson unexpectedly decides to renounce the violence his assignment demands, and Homeland Security official Cynthia Porter purposely sabotages a government spying operation she helped create. Consequently, Mike and Cynthia must pay the price for betraying the organizations they had once faithfully served.  Labeled a terrorist by the very people she used to work with, Cynthia faces a personal and professional crisis. Wilson is gunned down by a comrade-in-arms, although his new-found pacifism is passed onto fellow militia member Sam Norton. Now Norton is faced with foiling a terrorist plot to bomb Porters office and rescue her from zealous government agents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mercer Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What lies between Liberty & Security","title":"UnCivil Liberties","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
