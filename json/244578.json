Mixing political questions (Are we responsible for the government we get?) with more broadly existential ones (Do you feel you have control over your life?), the film centers on the tension between individual and collective responsibility. The film can be seen as a user's manual for citizenship in the 21st century, as well as a glimpse into the opinions and self-perceptions of a diverse group of Americans. It is a testament to the people of NYC in this new millennium, who freely offer up thoughtful, provocative and at times tender revelations to a complete stranger, just because she asked.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/x2DczQEiNthwZJXZJ19ceB2qYa1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35548,"logo_path":null,"name":"House Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Complete World","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
