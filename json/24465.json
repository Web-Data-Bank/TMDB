It was of their performance on August 27, 1986 at New Haven's Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The 90-minute release removed a few songs from the full performance. While the band attempted to record the previous night, audio problems prevented it from being used, although some video footage from that night would later surface in music videos. The concerts were part of the 5150 Tour, supporting the album of the same name, Van Halen's first with lead singer Sammy Hagar.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9ITUFXtbEhJV8xdzsd9tgiahfoq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Van Halen - Live Without A Net","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
