Sherman. The film posits that in the next 30 years, 20% of all forms of life will cease to exist. It argues that it can be for good business to save the environment: discoveries in the plant, animal, and microbiology worlds show that what you might think of as unimportant could be the cure to a major disease, save an entire species of plant, or ward off pests. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jKB8Q9vGGlyYJO4OW3hv3GUYdgY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Garden of Eden","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
