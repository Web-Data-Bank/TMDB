And “Mat Tiga Suku” is indeed an eccentric film that seeks to subvert our usual sense of logic, decorum and good taste. In this film, Mat Sentul is a poor and helpless man, lives in a house that talks to him, and daydreams about wealth and pretty princesses. It is an episodic adventure that follows the slapstick antics of Mat Sentul who, among many pranks, moves the bus-stop at his will, halts an aeroplane that does not give way, and pretends to be an office worker, a barber and a doctor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ngNl4C34It8eY4G7uo5XktPSf18.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cathay-Keris Films","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mat ¾ (Mat Tiga Suku)","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
