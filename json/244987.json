A singing group, trying to escape war-torn Sarajevo, has to wait for a tunnel to clear. While they wait, a cow has difficulty giving birth because of the \"torsion\" affecting its calf (i.e., it's in a twisted position inside). Fortunately, one of the choir members has some veterinary training, and with help from the chorus to drown out the sounds of war, the cow gives birth. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film.","popularity":0.611,"poster_path":"/gOxhnl80yIwq4q8LXVIr9skBE5T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Arkadena","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2003-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(A)Torsion","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9}
