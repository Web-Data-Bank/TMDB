Mike is the likeable slacker of the two. He is a substitute teacher who works well with kids, but would rather live on the golf course than be working. This infuriates his scheming long-time girlfriend, Cathy, and his banker father, Jack. They both want Mike to become a banker at Jack's office. Cathy's anger at Mike's inability to commit to the job drives her into another man's bed in an act of spite. Finding her in \"the act\" shocks Mike into a life crisis he's never faced before.
