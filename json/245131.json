The largely unknown cast features Steve Lattery, Alex Cole, Cedric Yabrough and Joshua Will.  The foursome play a free-wheeling, competitive style of golf, frequently making use of the \"mulligan\" ( golfing for 'do over'), a technique each of them, not surprisingly, begin to regularly utilize in their everyday (non-golfing) comings-and-goings, with predictably disastrous results.  Eventually, the foursome has difficulty separating golf from their real lives, along with the realization that they really don't like each other that much. A shared enemy serves to reunite the once-happy group however, and they drive off into the sunset on golf carts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mGFbzjFrXOtWf4gsgQSP5vBfTUH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mulligan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
