Set just as the Communist government is collapsing, the film focuses on the brutish Racz, the handyman in a Bratislava hotel. Knowing that his job is insured for life, Racz turns off the building's heat and demands food, money, and sex to have it restored. The film is narrated by a pimp named Urban who explains that people in the former Czechoslovakia were so used to being abused that they simply put up with Racz's corruption. By the end of the film, Racz's fortunes have changed considerably. Instead of being a lowly worker, he is now a ruthless and wealthy businessman, unafraid to kill or kidnap those who get in his way.","popularity":1.181,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75190,"logo_path":null,"name":"ALEF Film \u0026 Media Group","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":12594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ateliéry Bonton Zlín","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":76603,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alef Studio Bratislava","origin_country":""},{"id":94720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Markíza Slovakia","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"1998-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rivers of Babylon","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
