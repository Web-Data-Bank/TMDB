It shows how a small sphere travels in a determined and rhythmical manner through landscapes, emerging at the end into a larger sphere of white light. Both the graphic brushstroke and the music, with its haunting rhythms, are strikingly simple and direct. The theme of the film, a quest followed by a union, is as old as time and recognizable despite its limitless variations.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/rFm4yLnrQzvcr0I8ojdE1VaEn7c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineteam","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Aroma of Tea","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":26}
