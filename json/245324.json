The film’s characters – riddled with unconscious desires – find themselves imprisoned on an island. Drawing parallels to the work of British filmmaker Derek Jarman and staring Jarman’s actress-muse Tilda Swinton, Schlingensief’s raw and almost mythological film stands in contrast to his more offensive efforts.","popularity":1.557,"poster_path":"/utZnK4KWPQN3zJq5ClUfiv5sO9O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7350,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEM Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1987-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Greatest Love Drama of All Time","title":"Egomania: Island Without Hope","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":9}
