The royal court, the panoramic journey of the Prince to the overgrown castle, and the great celebratory dances of the happy ending (in which other famous fairy-tale figures appear) are all brought to life by the luscious designs of this celebrated production, created in 1946 for The Royal Ballet. The inspired performances of its revival for the 75th anniversary of the Company in 2006, together with a magnificent High Definition recording, make this a superb tribute to The Royal Ballet's unique style and visual splendour.","popularity":1.239,"poster_path":"/sysSKXHwZue05E8J1Z6GnMD3gGA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sleeping Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
