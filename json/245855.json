The brave Hirut grabs a rifle and tries to escape, but ends up shooting her would-be husband. In her village the practice of abduction into marriage is common and one of Ethiopia’s oldest traditions.  Meaza Ashenafi, an empowered and tenacious young lawyer, arrives from the city to represent Hirut and argue that she acted in self defense. Meaza boldly embarks on a collision course between enforcing civil authority and abiding by customary law, risking the ongoing work of her women’s legal aid practice to save Hirut’s life.","popularity":3.769,"poster_path":"/vcjdECnf9UFlSTynnll3Kyx5kKE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haile Addis Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-10","revenue":49667,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Amharic","iso_639_1":"am","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Difret","video":false,"vote_average":6.206,"vote_count":51}
