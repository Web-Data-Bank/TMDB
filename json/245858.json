The tree has big ambitions, doing everything it can to grow so tall that it reaches the sky. Featuring extraordinary photography, the film follows the adventures of its life from sapling to maturity, culminating in a triumphal Christmas Day. Along the way, viewers experience the natural - and human - world from a strangely moving perspective.","popularity":0.713,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fir Tree","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
