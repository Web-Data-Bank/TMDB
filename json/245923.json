Once upon a time, he was known as Boy Anino, notorious leader of the Bahala Na gang. But rival gangster Tony Razon (John Estrada) attacked him in his home, leaving his entire gang and his family dead in the ruins. But Porcuna survived, and now he returns under a new alias, Boy Golden, and he seeks revenge against those that did him wrong. Along the way, he meets Marla D (KC Concepcion), a dancer who also has a bone to pick with Razon. Together, the two carry out a dangerous plan to take on Manilaâ€™s toughest gangsters.","popularity":1.124,"poster_path":"/l1sQWuv53Gqc1Owc9zGdW0ec4hH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8356,"logo_path":"/z4Rv1ryUZMaGJwcaPD5nEvpOIDq.png","name":"Viva Films","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":8903,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scenema Concept International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2013-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on the Arturo Porcuna Story","title":"Boy Golden: Shoot-To-Kill","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
