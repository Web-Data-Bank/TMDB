Compared to that film or Maurice Lemaitre's Le film est déjà commencé?, Closed Vision is a more literary and downright genial effort. If Isou and Lemaitre were content to \"destroy cinema\" (exposing ugly, banal images or simply splicing in scratched-up blank leader in semi-conjunction with endless soundtrack harangues), Marc'O here seems almost to save it - or at least to invest serious effort toward finding a cinematic idiom equivalent to the novel's stream-of-consciousness (the subtitle is 'Sixty Minutes in the Interior Life of a Man').  Debuted at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival with endorsements from Jean Cocteau and Luis Buñuel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Society Of Cinema Arts (SCA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1954-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Closed Vision","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":4}
