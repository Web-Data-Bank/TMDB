Mateusz is an old-timer, a saddler, who finds nothing but hostility when he makes it home after years away. He is not a Jew, though the villagers brand him one and give him a hard time. They feel guilty about the death of his son at the end of the war, and don't want the father around. In the background: beginnings of the Communist regime in Poland.","popularity":0.734,"poster_path":"/rRxy1RWbo8st1ZjjTu9w0WrgUZZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burial of a Potato","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
