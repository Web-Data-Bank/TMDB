With contributions from Bob Ezrin, Mick Rock, Lenny Kaye, Paul Auster, Moe Tucker, Boy George, Thurston Moore, Andrew Wylie, Victor Bockris, Holly Woodlawn, Mary Woronov and Steve Hunter.","popularity":0.669,"poster_path":"/6YrT5eCEkjsZAqz9Jmx7CJm1x55.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Film tribute to Lou Reed, who died in October 2013, which looks at the extraordinarily transgressive life and career of one of rock 'n' roll's true originals","title":"Lou Reed - Remembered","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
