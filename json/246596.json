To add insult-to-injury Willie is also the store's designated 'Fired Man.\"; when a disgruntled customer demands that somebody-must-be-fired, Willie is summoned and summarily fired, only to be rehired when the now-satisfied customer has departed. Willie inadvertently adopts a four-year-old orphan at a cost of ten-dollars a week, and things go from bad to worse since Willie doesn't make ten-dollars a week. But, with the help of Mary, a beautiful young nurse, Willie manages to turn some corners and improve his lot in life, albeit with some skids along the way.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/dMT5ViBBl4LF6ajNbMpUyvTpX9H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Work","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
