The Studiedly Goofy and the Monumentally Grand are joined in masterly pas de don’t [...] The awed couple do battle with the status quo and teach the world to dance on the head of a bin. Rice detects real dignity in Bryan and amazing grace in Mead as they essay solitary promenades through the parks, subways and streets of a wintery New York landscape. Photographed and directed by Ron Rice, edited and scored by Taylor Mead.” –Edward Leffingwell","popularity":1.015,"poster_path":"/vPkbsTDIJe7zE6FlQ1f9jedwsOK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
