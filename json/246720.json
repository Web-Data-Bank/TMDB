Highlights include the only footage shot inside the Cotton Club, the only footage of famous Broadway shows like \"Babes in Arms,\" home movies of an all African-American regiment during World War II, films of street life in Harlem in the 1930s, and the family's cross-country tour in 1934.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wJQXQmj3dhaZe2e3Mq10zJhawHu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nicholas Brothers Family Home Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
