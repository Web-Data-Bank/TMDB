On stages filled with his own home-made stuffed animals, Palestine performs his trance-like strumming music. He is often referred to as a minimal composer, but rejects that in favour of \"maximalism\". Anne Maregiano's documentary about Palestine, The Golden Sound (2011), allows the artist to tell his own story while putting his music and performance, in long, unedited takes, at the centre of the film. - Close-Up Film Centre","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charlemagne Palestine, The Golden Sound","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
