A funny and bizarre comedy experience on board of the dream ship MS Melody with six chaotic Franconians – delightfully comically between pure nonsense and sparkling wit. Plus, dreamlike pictures from the Caribbean, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean Sea! Heißmann and Rassau in triplicate: As the Franconian couple Annelise and Georg Kaltengruber, as the two widows Mariechen and Waltraud, and of course as the goofball duo Hepp and Depp. And what all happens when a small bunch of Franconians embarks on a snow-white cruise ship is at times completely ludicrous.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/J6Qi5zr6KJqcksvuDeUpVZORZr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156881,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telefilm Medienprojekte","origin_country":""},{"id":156882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comödie Fürth","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2000-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6 auf See","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
