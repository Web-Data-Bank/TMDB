This production was captured by Digital Theatre live at London’s Regent’s Park Open Air theatre and was directed by Timothy Sheader.  Into the Woods takes the stories of the Brothers Grimm and gives them a dark and humorous twist.  The popular tales of Red Ridinghood, Jack (of Beanstalk fame), Cinderella and Rapunzel are interwoven with that of the Baker and his Wife and their quest to have a child. However this re-telling goes beyond \"happily ever after\" as the familiar characters find themselves in unfamiliar circumstances and hopes and dreams are questioned and revisited.","popularity":2.344,"poster_path":"/6fnoURevuXBfkqLOKaRD83ZNP5K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10534,"logo_path":"/4YO3fO356GQfmH2gWzADuRdnKIZ.png","name":"Digital Theatre","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Once upon a time...","title":"Into the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3}
