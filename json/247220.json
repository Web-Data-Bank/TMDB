The Rock (Rocky Johnson, The wild Samoans, the great Peter Mavia) Texas wrestling is largely defined by the Von Erich family, as well as the Funks, whose father Dory Sr. raised two future world champs, Dory Jr. and Terry. Canada considers the Hart family (Bret Hart, Owen Hart, British Bulldog, Jim the Anvil Neidhart) wrestling royalty. Great Families of Wrestling will examine these families, as well as the Guerreros, Ortons, Gagnes, Colons, DiBiases, Rhodes, Lawlers, and more. The DVD will explore the rich legacies these families have created in sports entertainment, and define their lasting impact. Fathers, sons, brothers, and grandsons will all be covered, including both relationships and connections acknowledged and long held secret.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2PYVz469cmi03Xv6TNQyocEJf9B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13651,"logo_path":"/rVJkMs9cSaE1BQoPiDcH6OxmaVZ.png","name":"WWE Home Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Most Powerful Families in Wrestling","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
