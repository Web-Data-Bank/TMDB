He then enlists his best friend, pretty honor student Toni, to help him pass his own anonymous letter to Debbie. But when Michael's younger brother snatches and misplaces the original letter, as well as the second letter also being mishandled, the mysteriously romantic words soon make their way into the hands of the adults in their families, touching off a scandalous soap opera of mixed-up motives, mistaken identities and misled emotions.","popularity":7.835,"poster_path":"/bhSItYbeibEIVn39da1ZkiTYl6A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41,"logo_path":"/xAot4SSOIHiWQ2WEnVXYGR1lce9.png","name":"Orion Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-06-14","revenue":8622757,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes What You're Looking For...
