Collect images and sounds instead of producing them.  The camera, the microphone and the mini-amplifier: tools that take away and then give back. We defined a rule: the sound shouldn't  illustrate the image and the image shouldn't absorb the sound.  Less than a hundred kilometres from Reykjavik we found Strokkur.  For three days we saw and heard the internal dynamics of the crevice: the boiling water that spat out every seven minutes and the thermal shock, given the eighteen degrees below zero of the atmosphere.","popularity":0.953,"poster_path":"/jE7fFA96ckcGSkb5TuXc1ttKaOP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agência da Curta Metragem","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2011-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strokkur","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":8}
