What follows is a comedy of misunderstandings in which these two very different, mature ladies are led on an unfortunate series of incidents which snowballs into a crime spree.  They prove to be more than a match for the unlikely pair of policemen, DI Woolley (Roger Lloyd Pack) and DS Stringer (Martin Freeman), who are left to solve the ladies disappearance and puzzling string of crimes which follow.  As the police net tightens around them, the two very different, mature ladies are propelled on a shared voyage of self-discovery as skeletons fall from the closets forcing both women to reflect on their past lives.","popularity":1.911,"poster_path":"/nyLSiyoVfqXkF0XlJd50LuHpHE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3448,"logo_path":"/dcA8JDfnnQPMaq8lv2CCiYrNe0S.png","name":"ITV","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carlton Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A bitter-sweet road movie with a difference sees two of Britain's best-loved actresses become fugitives mixed up in a crime spree... and possibly murder!","title":"Margery and Gladys","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5}
