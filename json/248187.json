In a dark stormy night they struggle to win each other to their personal points of view. She quotes the bible in terms of unconditional love - He does the same in terms of capital punishment. But are His manly insecurities based on solid grounds? After escaping His jealous rage, the nun lurks through the dark alleys and the bars like a vampire. Doomed to loneliness, all she wants is a Man. And who can this Man be?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9nr1Et7hNLPePTFpC6FZHhxdD6x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uzi Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":19196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blackmaria","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2010-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carne","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
