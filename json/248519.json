This was the time when China was repulsing a brutal attack of militarist Japan and when an outraged Rabindranath Tagore wrote to his friend in Japan, the great poet Noguchi: “I wish your countrymen, whom I love so much, not success but remorse”. This film holds the dubious distinction of being the first to be banned (though temporarily) in independent India.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/wpnnhHztf6IaGPEcyXaudk3xjZe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116151,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hemanta Bela Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1959-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Blue Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
