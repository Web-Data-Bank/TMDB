Julie is a sweet, vulnerable young woman who lacks confidence and is obsessed with the memory of her dead husband whom she idealizes. Alex is an angry writer. Talented but unable to repeat the success of his first novel, he has nothing left to say. Or live for. He just wants to die. Fate introduces these two lost souls at the edge of a cliff. While picking flowers Julie accidentally falls off. Alex, who has come to blow his brains out, is interrupted by her cry for help, just before he pulls the trigger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mAXRtOMVDpe1xoNmrNhNNoLTEvt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Snow Line Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":45,"logo_path":"/tUkNOAjyTt9D56DUeQfmmAFvwYQ.png","name":"Road Movies","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead by Monday","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
