Four decades after it closed its doors, it still retains a marked presence in the country's collective imagination for its pioneering spirit and stories of heroic deeds and for the bewilderment which was aroused by the facts surrounding its closure during the military regime.","popularity":0.633,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13573,"logo_path":"/4dqepK1XdLklrsYdnFpCEkOPXLX.png","name":"Canal Brasil","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2007-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panair of Brazil","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
