A master at playing nervous and neurotic characters, Knotts is also able to milk major laughs with his portrayals of romantically-challenged underdogs possessing oversized egos.  In this special comedy collection, he is joined by singer-actress Joey Heatherton, actress Jane Powell, former Dallas Cowboys player Lance Rentzel, comic Jack Burns, Knott's Love God movie co-star Maureen Arthur and the legendary Jimmy Durante.","popularity":2.744,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5463,"logo_path":null,"name":"MPI Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beyond Barney, it's Don Knotts - Tied up in laughter!","title":"Don Knotts: Tied Up with Laughter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
