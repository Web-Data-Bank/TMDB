The Secret Service agent who was seconds too late. The man wrongly accused of his murder. And the woman who unwittingly sheltered an assassin.

Experience November 22, 1963 as it has never been presented before, in this minute-by-minute account of that day, narrated by Academy Award-winner Kevin Spacey, and brought to life through rarely seen footage and rarely heard testimonies.","popularity":1.876,"poster_path":"/5kTUuYpSYxoH4WLU3NgSIMpuqJc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18894,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smithsonian Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Day Kennedy Died","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5}
