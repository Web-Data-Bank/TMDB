Our meeting took place on the terrace of the Hotel Majestic, in the midst of excitement of the Cannes festival life, a few days after the screening of Nel Regno di Napoli and in the presence of the photographer Jean-Claude Moireau.  Vivre à Naples et mourir is the audio capture of that informal meeting that happened on 20 May 1978 and which is, as per director's wish, more like a casual conversation than an interview in the strict sense of the term (a set of questions and answers).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6a2Ec7CalZyItGDFztJRX90TZsG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Amis de Cinématon","origin_country":""},{"id":100597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Archives de l’Art Cinématonique","origin_country":""},{"id":98738,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Fondation Gérard Courant","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivre à Naples Et Mourir","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
