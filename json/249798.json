The ever-charming Matthews plays Jeanne, a Parisian entertainer who manages to get herself in hot water with the French version of Actors' Equity and is forced to take a series of jobs under a series of assumed names. Meanwhile, a romantic triangle involving American film star Norma (Helen Whitney Bourne) and gangsters Pierre (Robert Flemyng) and Marcel (Louis Borrell) spells big trouble for all concerned -- including the plucky Jeanne. Highlighted by six sprightly song numbers, Head Over Heels in Love is our girl Jessie's vehicle all the way, and never mind the \"main\" plot. The film was directed by Sonnie Hale, who just so happened to be the star's husband.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xnZeyStSwoafuCYOM5MVxFH4OiN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4978,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaumont-British Picture Corporation","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1937-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head Over Heels","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
