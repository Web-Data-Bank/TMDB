There is Gerry's Era, and Gerry's Army, the Free Ride Generation and the birth of backside tube riding, Simon Anderson's spectacular three-fin Thruster debut. There is Michael Ho's broken wrist wonder, Tom Carroll and The Snap, Sunny Garcia's Three Knockdowns. There is the Rise and Rise of Kelly Slater and the Frontdoor/Backdoor domination of the Irons Bros. Year after year of outrageous rides, bone-crushing wipe-outs, nail-biting competition and the sort of drama that can only come when you pit the very best against the very worst: some of the most deadly, hairy, out-of-control waves ever seen. Pipeline Masters captures it all: the history, the action, the legends and lore-the soul-of the greatest surfing event ever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The world's most dangerous wave.Legendary surfers chasing the sport's ultimate thrill.","title":"Pipeline Masters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
