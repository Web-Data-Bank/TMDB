After the Cuban Revolution, it was conﬁscated by the State and became a shelter for homeless people. Located in Old Havana, today it is an imposing ruin. Jorge de los Rios, a retired clerk, is one of the few residents who remain there, along with La Flaca, his lover, and Waldo, a young itinerant. As the rest leave for safer places, Jorge clings to his dilapidated home and its buried treasures, slowly digging his way through its debris. The film speaks poignantly to a lost generation who fought in the Cuban Revolution and dreamed of a better society.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10140,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones de la 5ta Avenida","origin_country":""},{"id":54807,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Viaje Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":9974,"logo_path":"/jd5x1rD18FAswqv1tRwPJCSbRGz.png","name":"ICAA","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2014-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel Nueva Isla","video":false,"vote_average":6.25,"vote_count":4}
