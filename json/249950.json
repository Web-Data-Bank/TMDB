He sells milk from his neighbor to support his family, with whom he frequently quarrels.  The flight of his imagination is Tsog's only solace— he spends hours drawing his hero, a young monk.  After a fight with his parents Tsog takes off to the city, where he settles on the roof of an apartment building.  From this new vantage point he spots a beautiful but troubled young woman inhabiting a nearby penthouse.  Seeking to intertwine their fates— to bridge the gap between their social, economic, and spiritual conditions— Tsog steals a remote which he uses to control the young woman's television set.","popularity":1.054,"poster_path":"/mTnzWIpNqpwTSJv2nZ65s3rNEkj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101593,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guru Media","origin_country":"MN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"MN","name":"Mongolia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remote Control","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
