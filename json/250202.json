It is a movement, a crew, and a group of friends who all share the same passion for skiing. It is our goal to bring you a collection of images that not only give you a perspective of some of the most progressive riding to date, but also remind you just how fun skiing is. Watch as the 4BI9 crew embarks on a new adventure- one of groundbreaking feats, strange people, crazy times and epic proportions.
