He follows superhero manager Din Abu (Afdlin Shauki) to Kuala Lumpur and makes a name for himself there. Suffering culture shock at first, he gets involved in the social scene and changes his name to Azroy. In fact, when his mother, girlfriend, and friends from his hometown come to visit, Atoi pretends as if he does not know them. Soon, they too turn their backs on Atoi.
