A young man about to be deported visits his former employers to collect his off-the-books salary, a martial arts expert is looking for work, a young woman is haunted by the past and out for vengeance and an old man named Mirza is busy writing a letter to the king to get his final wish granted. An altogether urgent and nuanced portrait of a motley group of individuals, too often regarded as a homogeneous group.","popularity":0.894,"poster_path":"/nuD13NxdhU1PfEL7Ad4PEAFSMni.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Farms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2014-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter to the King","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":6}
