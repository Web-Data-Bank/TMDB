But her dream-come-true quickly turns into a nightmare when she allows a motley television crew of chickens, led by a sociopath, 'Charlie Chicken', to invade her home, manipulate her emotions, and drag her and her soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend into the desert on what is supposed to be a glamorous reality TV shoot. Deep in the surreal landscapes of the Joshua Tree desert, it becomes a battle of species. The hilarious antics of the oddball chicken crew, the blind faith of a reality TV star wannabe, and the cruel perversions of one really 'bad chicken', all spiral downward into an extremely unique Spaghetti Western.","popularity":1.463,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Chicken","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
