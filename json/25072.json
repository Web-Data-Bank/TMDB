She secretly begins a mystic fasting to end what she considers to be the second great flood. Elena is a thin and fashion-conscious woman ashamed of her daughter's chubbiness. She's willing to do the impossible to make her daughter Linda thin so Linda will look like a little princess on the day she receives her first communion. At the same time Elena's husband Gustavo - a professor of architecture - cannot cope with his wife's bones poking him during intimate moments so he turns his attention to a buxom female student with a hearty appetite.","popularity":1.559,"poster_path":"/cKcHyyesD1ArayO8Kh2LZNqy0ak.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2007-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malos hábitos","video":false,"vote_average":6.556,"vote_count":18}
