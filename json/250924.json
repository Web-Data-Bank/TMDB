The problem with Bujang is that he won’t settle for anything less than perfection when it comes to women. He wants the perfect wife, thus even the slightest of flaws in a woman will turn him off. But when he meets Murni, a village girl, he’s immediately smitten. To ensure that Murni is not like any other materialistic woman, Bujang tells her that he works as a personal driver. Murni begins to fall for Bujang and continues to date him since she just wants an average man. Things get complicated when Murni accidentally discovers Bujang’s secret and accuses him of trying to con her. Worse still, Bujang’s father does not approve of Murni, as he accuses her of trying to win over Bujang for his money. Devastated, Murni decides to return to her hometown and marry any man that her parents find suitable. That leaves Bujang racing against time to win Murni back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2GzZ3DmRJdXHeis6mm4DlBvI4l5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bujang Senang","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
