Humiliated on graduation night, Edwin viciously murdered the entire camp before vanishing into legend. Now, despite the warnings of the town drunk, old man Bonzo has reopened the ranch and a new class of clowns have unwittingly signed up. When their die-hard instructor Sgt. Funnybone (Miguel Martinez, The Donor Conspiracy) is found dead in a puddle of cream pie and blood, the curriculum changes from comedy to survival! Edwin slashes, stabs, strangles, and disembowels the clowns while laughing insanely at his own bad jokes.","popularity":2.134,"poster_path":"/pb7VpMyKibrGZfBRVS0gkVIktRG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52454,"logo_path":null,"name":"I Can't Believe It's Not Hollywood!
