The only thing he has is a camera, and he stays at churches hoping people will hire him to take their photographs. During one day, he has three encounters that change his life: the first, with a smooth-talking young man who's standing by the church door who berates him for wasting his life in church, the second with a boy who offers to take his picture, and the third with a Mercedes-driving man who's been stuck in traffic and has no patience left. Is there any deliverance from the soullessness of the city?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/1jPGDdQl8okddgnLkpTykc9lW8f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19505,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadrunner Network","origin_country":""},{"id":30241,"logo_path":null,"name":"AtomFilms","origin_country":""},{"id":90141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmex Productions","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":19503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fuji-keyser Mercantile Co.
