He does his homework so well that Jane takes him on as her own \"male mistress.\"","popularity":0.722,"poster_path":"/dlAjDOw93jJA38zJEl3rzrE39O1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obsessed with a Married Woman","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
