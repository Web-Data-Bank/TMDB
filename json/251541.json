A decade of idealism, war, murder, and carnage followed, bringing about the end of feudalism and the rise of equality and a new world order. The French Revolution is a definitive feature-length documentary that encapsulates this heady (and often headless) period in Western civilization. With dramatic reenactments, illustrations, and paintings from the era, plus revealing accounts from journals and expert commentary from historians, The French Revolution vividly unfurls in a maelstrom of violence, discontent, and fundamental change. King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Maximilien Robespierre, and Napoleon Bonaparte lead a cast of thousands in this essential program from THE HISTORY CHANNELÂ®. Narrated by Edward Herrmann (The Aviator, Gilmore Girls), The French Revolution explores the legacy that--now more than ever--stands as both a warning and a guidepost to a new millennium","popularity":0.943,"poster_path":"/ijfkue9bb70gte32vNLNF5AaIRD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The French Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
