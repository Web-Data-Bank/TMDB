He is a loner and a serious-minded man, who dislikes any display of emotions. He spends three months in the hospital while being tested. After observing patients and hospital routines around him from a distance, he learns that he will need a kidney transplant. Meanwhile his personal and professional life is falling apart: he refuses his wife's offer to donate the kidney for him; the scientific problem he was working on has been solved elsewhere. In the end Adam cracks under the prolonged pressure, waiting for the sound of an ambulance bringing a moribund patient whose kidney may be used for the transplant.","popularity":0.942,"poster_path":"/6Xpvt7LI1qYwfVDHoxITcXbGe24.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zesp√≥l Filmowy \"Tor\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1972-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salvation","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
