Ever since its creation in 1947, Pakistan seems to have been a prisoner of the conflicting geopolitical legacy which hampers its political and economic development. Political divide stems from multiple factors such as its antagonism with India, its relationship to neighbouring Afghanistan, and its strategy of changing alliance with world powers, in addition to the banner of Islam which, unable to unite ethnic groups, has at times exacerbated conflict between Muslims in this country of 150 million inhabitants that plays - and will continue to play for a long time to come - a central role in worldwide political and strategic affairs.","popularity":1.342,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pakistan zindabad: Longue vie au Pakistan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
