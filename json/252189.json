However, the decade ended and so did director Julian Barrett’s career. Now Barrett plans to resurrect his gory series via a modern reboot patterned after reality filmmaking. With his former leading lady and an eclectic group of 10 young “contestants,” Barrett returns to the same locale where his old splatter-fests were filmed. When one of the campers is found savagely murdered, they realize there’s more at stake than just fame and fortune. Each of them is in a fight for their lives as they realize summer is over – forever.","popularity":3.122,"poster_path":"/miPrgjf8l44UkWstGB3PDscx7MP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Class of 85 LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pitch your tent, dig your grave.","title":"Camp Dread","video":false,"vote_average":5.146,"vote_count":24}
