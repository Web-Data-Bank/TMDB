The women filmmakers invited to direct for the seven sins were amongst the world's most renown: Helke Sander (Gluttony), Bette Gordon (Greed), Maxi Cohen (Anger), Chantal Akerman (Sloth), Valie Export (Lust), Laurence Gavron (Envy), and Ulrike Ottinger (Pride). Each filmmaker had the liberty of choosing a sin to interpret as they wished. The final film reflected this diversity, including traditional narrative fiction, experimental video, a musical, a radical documentary, and was delivered in multiple formats from 16, super 16, video and 35mm.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/zwftNGXq3NsqRZsJCX5vErybQfV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":75520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Helke Sander Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":75911,"logo_path":null,"name":"Variety Motion Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":111001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valie Export Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":155525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ulrike Ottinger Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1986-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Seven women filmmakers explore the seven deadly sins","title":"Seven Women, Seven Sins","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":8}
