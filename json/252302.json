Instead of modeling objects of human imagination the realm of mathematics is explored. Only the variables of one formula (x[n+1]=x[n]^p-c) were changed. It took me about a year to get an idea of the transformations and shapes which could be expressed by this formula. Almost another year was needed to render the sequences which I decided to use.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7KSGaawZ07nf26oYf4iDOWL9RsV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gestalt","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
