More than just capturing one of the largest bluegrass festivals of that decade, this documentary is also an interesting mixture of live performances, interviews, impromptu jam sessions and crowd footage of live music set in a small town surrounded by the now long gone red clay and tobacco shacks of North Carolina.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":"/e9UJFWI63IPJ4LW0EL0PfUSqfAc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Washington Film Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bluegrass Country Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
