Through stories retold by painters, tatto artisits, barbers and other coloful characters we get the picture of a vibrant multi-ethnic neighborhood where people struggled to survive, get along and move ahead, at a time when real estate development and gentrification has started to push the low income housing residents away for the benefit of affluent professionals. Featuring a number of known people as themselves: John MIchael Boyer, Griffin Dunne, Lloyd Kaufmann, Charlie Sheen, Mira Sorvino, Ivy Supersonic and more. The film concludes with a revisit to the Hell's Kitchen of 2007, where the redevelopment transformation has all but been complete.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kY3TO6YNQ16VNbbBZBmzmUAkYbS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell's Kitchen: A New York Neighborhood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
