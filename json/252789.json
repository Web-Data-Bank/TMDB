The \"star attraction\" here, as far as I'm concerned, is the ballad \"Agnes\", probably an original song by Philip A. Scheib (during a period when they were working hard to introduce them in these films; \"Gypsy Life\" being the only one anyone remembers). The scenes with the couple on a bicycle was an early one by \"Connie\" Rasinski, exhibiting his learning from Bill Tytla. The shot with the cats walking down the aisle is by a staffer whose animation was full of awkwardness and errors, but was also ambitious and charming.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A June Bride","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
