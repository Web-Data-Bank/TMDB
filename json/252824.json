For one thing, Al is appallingly dependent on Elsa for his every emotional need. For another, Elsa is an incredibly elusive person, extremely difficult to pin down about anything - especially whatever is bothering her. How they have managed to survive this long is a cause for wonder. When Al gets an opportunity to be cast in a movie role, complete with no-cost occupancy in the casting agent's ugly but fashionable apartment, he jumps at the chance to provide a little material satisfaction for his beloved Elsa. But what exactly does she want?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/g9pWDYpJ4PJbIH8fuyfpSvuSgPC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orly Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":29654,"logo_path":null,"name":"AB Films","origin_country":""},{"id":95930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Au Progrès du singe","origin_country":""},{"id":95931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chapeau Rouge Films","origin_country":""},{"id":95932,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions du 3ème Etage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Around the Park","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
