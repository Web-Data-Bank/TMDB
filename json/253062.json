He expects to be awarded a medal at a large parade in town where veteran sharp-shooters will be honored. When the town council is one medal short, Anton must wait another year for his prized possession. He drowns his disappointment in drink at the local pub and becomes so drunk that he insults the emperor who sentences him to jail. Instead of fulfilling the emperor’s orders himself, Anton sends his employee in his stead.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rvyt1VhJot9p0ytbuWRoRC992Qe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Meissner Film Prague","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1932-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anton Spelec, Sharp-Shooter","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":8}
