We drop in on the fillies, who gossip in New York accents. That's followed by a pre-race fashion parade. In both of these, Maggie doesn't join in; she runs every year, but suffers from hay fever. The actual race is run, and Maggie is far back in the field. The other horses hear it's going to be a photo finish, though, and they all come to an abrupt stop and pose except Maggie, who keeps running and wins the race.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gallopin' Gals","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
