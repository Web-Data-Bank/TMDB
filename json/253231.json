Marker went to Israel as an outsider, looking to discover the spirit of the young country through its \"language of signs.\" He found a place whose unique moral and political obligations could provide a new, humane model of nationhood to the world.  In DESCRIPTION OF A MEMORY, director Dan Geva, an Israeli, explores what has happened in his homeland in the years since with a more critical eye, asking whether the promises Marker identified have been fulfilled. Structured by thirteen memories, the film is an open-ended, essayistic meditation on the distance between the ideals that fueled the creation of Israel and the realities of its history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Description of a Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
