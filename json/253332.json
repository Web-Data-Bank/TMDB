Giving a career-best performance exclusive to the film, the band members share their thoughts on fame, love, mortality — &amp; car maintenance. Director Florian Habicht (Love Story) weaves together the band’s personal offerings with dream-like specially-staged tableaux featuring ordinary people recruited on the streets of Sheffield. Pulp is a music film like no other — by turns funny, moving, life-affirming &amp; (occasionally) bewildering.","popularity":4.214,"poster_path":"/3vziV0NRlthBfjFaBwYqq6dSh6a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4748,"logo_path":"/bTMeosrSiKaTPmZiTYnSDZlin5d.png","name":"Oscilloscope","origin_country":"US"},{"id":20636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pistachio Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pulp: a Film About Life, Death & Supermarkets","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":32}
