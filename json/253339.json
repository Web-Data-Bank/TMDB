The result was “All American High”, an unusually honest and humorous look at 80’s teen life. Told through the eyes of a visiting foreign exchange student, the film presents an uncensored view of senior year in the era of big hair, punks and parachute pants. Thirty years after they lived it, some of the film’s original subjects return in new interviews, revisiting one of the most memorable chapters in their lives.","popularity":1.17,"poster_path":"/jiy5BsM7MM5SsEj6vKJtL5iBbRZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All American High: Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8}
