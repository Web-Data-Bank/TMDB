A Maine farmer says she found a chicken frozen stiff, but was able to resuscitate it. Colorado natives tell a story of the chicken who lost its head-- and went on living. A Virginia farmer tells about (and demonstrates) the benefits of raising chickens for his own consumption. Perhaps most surprising is the case of the Florida woman: she bathes her pet bird, and takes it both swimming and shopping. Through these and other stories, this documentary illuminates the role that chickens play in (some of) our lives.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/qEujQPEenpd1CgSL8M3ApoGdJf8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14501,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeVillier Donegan Enterprizes","origin_country":""},{"id":109795,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmFour","origin_country":""},{"id":109796,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mark Lewis Radio Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Natural History of the Chicken","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
