As a music genre, black metal differs from the others by having a strong ideological contest. Satanic values, glorification of evil and unsolidarity, as well as pure hatred towards christian and multicultural society, are more than just childish rebellion for the people involved.  Eternal Flame of Gehenna examines the phenomena through interviewing the key figures of the moment. It gives the face to a subculture seen as a threat to common safety by Finnish Security Intelligence.  In this movie you find out about thoughts of a grave violator, grave robber and hear what they feel when the old wooden church is burning down. Eternal Flame of Gehenna is also a view on the history and the current state of finnish black metal featuring bands like Azaghal, Azazel, Barathrum, Beherit, Enochian Crescent, Goatmoon, Goatmoon, Horna, Satanic Warmaster etc.","popularity":0.657,"poster_path":"/aAjOJ6RUlosd5LY7xewq26yJqiw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eternal Flame of Gehenna","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":10}
