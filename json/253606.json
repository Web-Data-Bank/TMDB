He is creative and free-spirited, and he loves his Danish wife, but unfortunately the rules and regulations of the Danish and Swedish societies obstruct their wish to live a peaceful life. They embark on a Kafkaesque journey through the European legal systems, and end up not being allowed to stay in Denmark, or Sweden; in fact anywhere at all. As the legal decisions threaten to ruin their relationship, Camilo ultimately faces an impossible dilemma: Should he go back to Cuba, possibly ending up in prison, or should he stay in Scandinavia illegally, with or without the love of his life?","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Crossing a Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
