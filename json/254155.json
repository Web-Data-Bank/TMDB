Yi-ping, on the other hand, has just graduated from the police academy and is more than ready to prove herself regardless of any risks. Daughter of the head of the National Policy Agency, Yi-ping is secretly kept away from danger by being appointed to team up with Chi-yi. Starting from a seemingly pointless case of a puppy’s accidental death, the essentially incompatible pair unexpectedly dig up the clues to a series of mysterious deaths.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/e03s2ctkfl2nc3QZQSx8RKO22LA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2014-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tale of murder, greed, revenge, love and chocolate!","title":"Sweet Alibis","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
