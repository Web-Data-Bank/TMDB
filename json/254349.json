You can expect a mix of humor, tradition, adventure and stunning imagery; as I team up with Jesse Day: a Canadian entertainer who lives in Seoul and raps in Korean.  Highlights include me catching and eating a live octopus, attending an exorcism and learning zen martial arts from monks.  Now, I invite you to sit back, click “full-screen” and enjoy the show.  - See more at: http://www.adventuresofagoodman.com/watch-get-lost-in-korea-online/#sthash.rlvltmez.dpuf","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Get Lost in Korea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
