He chews out Mama; she tells him if he doesn't like the housekeeping, he can do it himself, and storms out. What follows is pretty much the usual bunch of man-keeping-house jokes: a voracious vacuum, an overflowing sink, crashing dishes, and a dozen crises at once. And still no buttons on the pants.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8o7AnuuQB7vAqrY0Z23wKUE3ebS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Monday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
