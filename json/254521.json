The opening sections of the film focus upon those who have tried and failed to establish a lasting power in the capital. ‘At Delhi’, the commentator states, ‘successive cities have been built by conquering invaders – each has fallen into disuse and decay’. The camerawork focuses on the ‘impressive ruins’ of these earlier invaders.

Shahjahan had built the eighth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u72adfhgzghSyuJJz9bfr6xMlgB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30156,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Window","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1938-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delhi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
