Nearly 100 Danes are presented in the film, amongst them a racing cyclist, a Minister of Finance, a popular actor and 13 unmarried women from a provincial town. \"There is too much fogginess and rain and melancholy in most of the pictures of Denmark,\" says Jørgen Leth. \"But not in my film. I would like to show you some authentic, clear and beautiful pictures from this strange country.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jørgen Leth Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1972-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life in Denmark","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
