Donning the guise of \"Leatherface,\" a swashbuckling masked avenger, Van Ryke performs his derring-do on behalf of the Prince of Orange (Nigel de Brulier). Naturally, Van Ruke considers beautiful Spanish aristocrat Donna Leonora de Vargas (Vilma Banky) to be a bitter enemy, and the feeling is mutual. To no one's surprise, however, Van Ryke and Donna Leonara eventually fall in love (hence the title). The pulse-pounding climax finds Van Ryke riding hell-for-leather through a rainstorm to warn the Flemish troops about the Spaniards' plans to burn the city of Ghent to the ground. Two Lovers was based on Madame Orczy's novel Leatherface, and adapted for the screen by Alice Duer Miller.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":"/xqC2MnFpqOLzRryzWs4mACyzq21.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28205,"logo_path":"/70VLg1uTo7gXdJQczgl1DPmp3hT.png","name":"Samuel Goldwyn Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every Emotion Thrillingly Yours in This Their Final Picture Together!","title":"Two Lovers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
