When the Germans kidnap her in Cairo and she starts appearing in radio broadcasts from Berlin, her British soldier friends think that she's joined the enemy. They couldn't be more wrong, because after the war it turns out that her songs over the radio contained secret messages to London from British agents in Berlin.","popularity":0.741,"poster_path":"/jqczf2XGI0S96r0owMuW9mNp0Y0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19057,"logo_path":null,"name":"William Gell Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":77383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monarch Productions Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1950-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lilli Marlene","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":3}
