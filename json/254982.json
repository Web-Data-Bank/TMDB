Now plaintive, now crass, now searching, now pleading, the line takes on a haunting quality not quite undercut by the tune’s tongue-in-cheek twang. The work introduced a recurring motif in the artist’s repertoire: the slick-haired singer, a persona Kjartansson has honed in real life as front man for the synth-heavy Reykjavík rock band Trabant, now on hiatus. The band’s performances — as seen on YouTube, anyway — have been blowout affairs, full of rock ’n’ roll swagger and screaming teenage fans. Mercy was a first step toward connecting this sassy streak with the artist’s maturing explorations of Icelandic identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mercy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
