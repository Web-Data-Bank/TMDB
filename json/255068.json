Borders is about men and women dreaming of a better life in Europe and the high price they often have to pay for it - if they succeed at all. Without taking an immediate moral stance, the film follows the route that many immigrants take from the heart of Africa to the centre of Europe, stopping at each border: Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal , Mauritania, Morocco, Spain, France, Belgium, and finally, the Netherlands.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uK0KxCqmrRs57P6z4lODeCjIprv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19962,"logo_path":"/ppbBv0isUhxiI1UABAn89lIUhn6.png","name":"Pieter van Huystee Film \u0026 TV","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
