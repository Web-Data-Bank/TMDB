This 3D film project about the soul of buildings allows six iconic and very different buildings to speak for themselves, examining human life from the unblinking perspective of a manmade structure. Six acclaimed filmmakers bring their own visual style and artistic approach to the project. Buildings, they show us, are material manifestations of human thought and action: the Berlin Philharmonic, an icon of modernity; the National Library of Russia, a kingdom of thoughts; Halden Prison, the world's most humane prison; the Salk Institute, an institute for breakthrough science; the Oslo Opera House, a futuristic symbiosis of art and life; and the Centre Pompidou, a modern culture machine. CATHEDRALS OF CULTURE explores how each of these landmarks reflects our culture and guards our collective memory.","popularity":2.372,"poster_path":"/fXlIjytQH4GcGBkShAhpE3Cbh7V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neue Road Movies","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":37058,"logo_path":"/pWUIywEOdy0650kBbuRw5aI90zA.png","name":"Lotus-Film","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":21979,"logo_path":"/eF0zPuxDh0WlbU5n17OxpEn8b2B.png","name":"Mer Film AS","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'ici","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":36730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sundance Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":89394,"logo_path":"/m1Hku3PhgdsQiPO8uVe7szyrxAb.png","name":"RadicalMedia","origin_country":"US"},{"id":157807,"logo_path":"/tyrJOOVAUIxQEJzjP1PhP2H5zFi.png","name":"WOWOW","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cathedrals of Culture","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
