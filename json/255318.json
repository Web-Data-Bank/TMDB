The (very few) action scenes are a complete mess. The film is basically an over-the-top melodrama and makes very little sense. I was too frustrated to even enjoy the beauty of Cheryl Yang and Annie Wu.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cyt29qfzDtWN5Qg1XKEkFtVAF5Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West Town Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
