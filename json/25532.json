Claudio Tamburrini is a goalie for a minor-league football team when he is abducted by members of the Argentine military police and taken to an unofficial detention center on the false suspicion that he is a terrorist. As he is tortured by intelligence agents looking for information he doesn't have, Tamburrini fully expects to be killed. After many sessions of brutal torture, Tamburrini and his fellow captives Guillermo and Tano are being readied for execution when, in a final desperate act, Tamburrini dives out a window during a rainstorm.","popularity":3.405,"poster_path":"/3qXchNc4yEq5pY9FvwDBt9YPyTh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89634,"logo_path":null,"name":"20th Century Fox Argentina","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":21914,"logo_path":"/iF5QYCtPLuwkU90jWdjrul25d71.png","name":"K \u0026 S Films","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2006-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Inside View of Political Detainees","title":"Chronicle of an Escape","video":false,"vote_average":6.553,"vote_count":57}
