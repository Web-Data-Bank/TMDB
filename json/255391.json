Suffering from increasing dementia since her husband's death, Mitsue (Harue Akagi) is a constant source of comic energy or annoyance for Yuichi, and he and his son must soon decide if they should put her in a home for the elderly. Jumping back in time, we see how Mitsue (played by Kiwako Harada) tracked the tumult of the latter half of the 20th century, being raised as one of 10 brothers and sisters, surviving the war, and having to push her alcoholic husband (Ryo Kase) along in life. \"Pecoross\" is directed by the oldest active film director in Japan, Azuma Morisaki, who creates an emotionally complex work that is only the more profound and life-affirming for its cartoonish portrayal.","popularity":1.179,"poster_path":"/duPy7BQGF51F8AjjQNAJ6FheFPb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Manga artist Yuichi Okano begins writing nurse notes while taking care of his mother, who is afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.","title":"Pecoross' Mother and Her Days","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":7}
