Though he works as a low-level party functionary during the day, he finds his greatest challenges in the raising of a son on his own. Alternating between trying to bond with his son (even getting drunk with him), and verbally accosting him, Ma is at a loss. One day the son decides that the best way for his father to stop harassing him, will be to find him a new wife, which he finds in the form of the mother of a school friend, Qing Huaiyuan.","popularity":1.153,"poster_path":"/oYXI3bpBJUO9uFrACXP3NdAGq89.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":708,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":20029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing Good Dreams","origin_country":""},{"id":20030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing Shanhe Yingshi Yishu See","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2000-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8}
