Without any previous research, characters, locations or established themes, a film crew arrives at the Paraiba backlands in search of people with stories to tell. In the town of São João do Rio Peixe, they discover the Araçás Farm, a rural community where 86 families live, the majority connected by family ties. Thanks to the mediation of a young woman from Araçás, the residents – consisting mostly of elderly people – tell their life stories, marked by popular Catholicism, hierarchy, a sense of family and honor. A world on the verge of disappearing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bSvBiQ6GwxFgwE9gcE0Hxio1Gk7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":346,"logo_path":"/kzQAFe6cBI0cbHZP3lUiHmeEyAF.png","name":"Videofilmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2006-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Fim e o Princípio","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":6}
