They live in glass houses (this was written before the invention of television), which allows the political police, called “Keepers” can easily supervise them.

They feed on artificial food and rest hour marching in fours in a row the anthem of the One State, pouring out of the loudspeakers. As they are allowed to put a break on the hour (known as the ”sexy time“), draw the curtains of their glass houses.
