Thus originates Childhelp, which later runs multi-disciplinary centers for abused and/or neglected children in the States. Among them is bright Jacob Fletcher, whose stepfather, a lawyer, terrorized him into utter trauma and reclaims him shortly after 10 months in jail. Jacob's peers have distressing stories of their own, but competent, devoted staff helps most of them decisively on the former farm, using animal therapy.","popularity":1.855,"poster_path":"/wbSMDYKOeV9WjNNyLB8dOD9lC9l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Craig Anderson Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alberta Film Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":3431,"logo_path":"/bVTF0p5xlPfQhQIuBLr9BFtrKip.png","name":"Lifetime","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For the Love of a Child","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
