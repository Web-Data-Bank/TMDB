Because despite my young age, I truly have a story to tell.  This summer, I sat down with a camera crew in our workshop to share some incomprehensible lows and truly inspiring highs. This short documentary offers a rare glimpse into the heart and soul of my life. I’ve been aiming for WRC since I was a child. A story of having everything – and loosing it all.  The documentary runs for twelve minutes and features never before-seen private home video, Skoda material, Volkswagen material and shots by my long-lasting friend and photographer Nino Minic.  I hope you like it!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I AM Andreas Mikkelsen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
