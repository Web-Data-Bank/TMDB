He finds a job at a Catholic home for orphans, where he forms a new soccer team, with the help of one very good player Pepe who turns out to be a girl. 'Pepe' is the sister of one of the orphans, who comes to the all-boy orphanage posing as a boy, because her former foster home was an abusive environment. Along the way, Manny has incurred a gambling debt, his creditors begin to lean on him, and the boys find out. They set up a soccer game and stake the outcome against Manny's debt. If they win, the debt will be forgiven.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2oWDCNbNmb3W0QhPkuyRskTiABI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17611,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sean S.
