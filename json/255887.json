Tuareg Electric Guitar trance rock, Bori cult dance ceremonies, Fulani Folk, and Roadhouse Gospel Rave-ups are some of the segments included in this latest \"Folk Cinema\" classic from Sublime Frequencies! Filmed in December of 2004 on location in Niger, Hisham Mayet delivers a spontaneous, raw, and inspiring collection of images, music, and ceremony (again with a single camera presentation) from a nation mired in poverty and continual post-colonial disappointment. Quoting from Mayet’s liner notes: \"This is not music as commodity, this is music as survival. There is a saying in Niger that goes, \"when we die we know we are going to heaven because we already live in Hell\" well I think its more like the purgatory that we all live in and they sure have managed to transcend with an incredible natural resource: Music. Dig it!\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sublime Frequencies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NE","name":"Niger"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Niger: Magic and Ecstasy in the Sahel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
