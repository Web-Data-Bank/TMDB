He's also the brilliantly odd creation of Gregg Turkington, a decidedly more gifted comedian who has found a loyal cult following for his Tony Clifton-esque character. In this concert release, Hamburger performs a handful of twangy country tunes alongside the Too-Good-For-Neil-Hamburger Band, a name that speaks the truth: the back-up group includes veteran rockers Prairie Prince, David Gleason, and Atom Ellis.","popularity":1.178,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20107,"logo_path":null,"name":"Drag City","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neil Hamburger: Western Music and Variety","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
