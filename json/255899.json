They are said to possess the power to assist or devastate the lives of those who recognize them. A PWE is a ceremony held to appease a Nat.  Pwes are arranged daily throughout Burma for many purposes including the achievement of success in business, a happy marriage, or improving one's health. A Nat is summoned through a Kadaw; the flamboyant and charismatic master of the Pwe dressed in elegant costume. The Kadaw is a spirit medium, dancer, storyteller, and magician who exposes the crowd to a living incarnation of the Nat brought forth through opening ritual and careful observance of tradition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sublime Frequencies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nat Pwe: Burma's Carnival of Spirit Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
