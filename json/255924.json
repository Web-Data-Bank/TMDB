In a series of tableaux, people perform everyday tasks — sleeping, dining, reading, card-playing — as the camera arcs past and over them (the replete set of positions recalls La région centrale’s movements). Brown abraded the film stock, creating a continuous dynamic surface-effect tension with the comparatively static views and cueing the soundtrack, the crackle of fire. The physics and chemistry of combustion were the scientific focus of Lavoisier, the 18th-century savant.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zQeKSxBY6kLk8E7aGMPSAcRUPyl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Lavoisier, Who Died in the Reign of Terror","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":5}
