She is compliant, which makes her an easy target for men. She's religious, believing she is God's favorite child; she searches for Jesus. She has sent a letter to a filmmaker suggesting her life as the subject for a movie. We see her raped then take up with a series of men she believes are Jesus, each willing or insistent on sex. A young man with his own crisis of faith invites her to join a cult. We see her involuntarily committed to an asylum from time to time where medication and constraints await. Her wealthy parents are helpless. Will a medical professional ever talk to her? If one did, would it help?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c7NNfbCQQUzy1Ry5gdSN6H7GRK1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mainline","origin_country":""},{"id":45988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Helma Sanders-Brahms Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Mercy No Future","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
