Seven Cüceler (dwarfs) (dressed like MGM Munchkin soldiers, only red and white) who assist the Good Witch of the North appear at various times to help. She meets a Scarecrow, an Iron Woodman, and a Cowardly Lion, and dances to music from what appears to be an invisible radio. They encounter fighting trees, a river, and a country of China dolls on their way to the Wizard, a ball of fire who sends them after the Wicked Witch who enslaves them. When the Wizard is unable to help Aysecik get home, they must journey again for help, encountering the China Country once more, and a legion of hammer-throwing cavemen.","popularity":0.99,"poster_path":"/yeej4UqAs9b1ySGYQPjXYcavEqw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hisar Film","origin_country":"TR"},{"id":113142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ören Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1971-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aysecik in the Land of the Magic Dwarfs","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5}
