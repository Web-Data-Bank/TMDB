Somewhat less concerned with myths of the old west than its predecessor, BLUE SUN WESTERN, this film paints a portrait of a mystic and beautiful landscape - itself a living character of the pre-historic west. In this locale the sun's light is both emitted from, and reflected by blue-black depths: coral-like rock formations provide the backdrop for a shadow-play of vibrations extending beyond the lake's ancient basin. Outside of time, these ripples echo through neon boulevards of present day, an 1800s-era cemetery, and back again - always in the formidable presence of the pyramid. On the soundtrack, a ghostly chorus rises and gives way to a ballad for a cowboy bandit - an extension of shared romantic hope.  \"The most successful metaphoric envisionment of the desert that I've seen in many years.\" - Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lake of the Spirits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
