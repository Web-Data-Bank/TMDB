Anticipating later writings by Roland Barthes and Susan Sontag (who professed her admiration for the film) If I Had Four Dromedaries reveals Marker's instinctual understanding of the secret rapport between still and moving image.","popularity":0.778,"poster_path":"/5RbsdsffZWulqCyDvSmVKTuTJDC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89420,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.P.E.C.","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17043,"logo_path":"/wOBCQfhPuojzf2A0eOzktyjT6JS.png","name":"Iskra","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If I Had Four Dromedaries","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
