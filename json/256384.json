Though Banubai, Percy's mother, utterly dominates Percy's life, she does so with love and kindness. Percy holds a clerical position in a small Unani pharmacy, famous for its sexual restoratives. It is only at his place of work, where he wields some power, that Percy displays a measure of authority and self-assurance. One day, Percy discovers a fraud in the office accounts, as a consequence of which one of the junior employees is sacked. This event has far-reaching consequences in the lives of Percy and Banubai. Percy's peace is soon to be shattered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cMXHls9Cef6xhSth8DpLtyNO14N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development Corporation of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Gujarati","iso_639_1":"gu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Percy","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
