For a month she has no customers. Then, in short order, she has her first customer, meets Midori, a gangly Japanese tourist, and invites her to stay with her, and meets Masako, a formal and ethereal middle-aged woman whose luggage has gone missing. The three women work in the diner, interact, and serve customers. A somewhat brusque man teaches Sachie to make delicious coffee, then he returns under other circumstances. Three neighborhood women inspect the empty diner every day; will anything bring them inside? We learn why Sachie serves rice balls; but why Finland?","popularity":4.316,"poster_path":"/2J1Pkw1DPMbFRuN07RI6TlZbNmt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gentosha","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":70981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradise Cafe","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":37084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Suits","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":11725,"logo_path":"/3OZxd70DZ1LbVelmZK8mR5FIXxO.png","name":"VAP","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":6755,"logo_path":"/c0ENH8QeZLvCACpzCpwvYMy2SDr.png","name":"Nippon Television Network Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where are we welcome?","title":"Kamome Diner","video":false,"vote_average":7.233,"vote_count":45}
