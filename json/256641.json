Sita is never actually seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a womens' liberationist perspective, and is about the tragedy of power and the sacrifices that adherence to dharma demands, including abandoning a chaste wife.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/i0HwBytEhBUOaogObCAgjtuquCE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76002,"logo_path":null,"name":"General Pictures","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1978-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""},{"english_name":"Sanskrit","iso_639_1":"sa","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kanchana Sita","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":9}
