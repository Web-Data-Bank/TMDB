To ensure his success, she denies her love for an iconoclastic painter for whom she models, prostitutes herself to a Party figure, encourages her son to break with his true love because the girl is a Jew, and, in general, behaves in paranoid ways, believing, for example, that a new lodger, Evgeny, is a KGB spy. She also has her own family secrets, which she will go to any length to keep her son from learning.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":"/qCieDIAxibE5kFje4SEUH6LPbeo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ibrus","origin_country":""},{"id":170585,"logo_path":"/1nUzkMSbZOzoYgHHhBSJ5xGwnIm.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1992-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To See Paris and Die","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2}
