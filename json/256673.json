However, on the day of departure, she must learn that her husband Stefan has an affair with his assistant. So Anne sets off with her children alone. In order not to be found for Stefan, she lodges in a small guesthouse, which is run by the somewhat grumpy, but kind-hearted Lina Hansen. While Anne finds an admirer in Lina's son, the idiosyncratic Fischer Jan, Stefan also makes his way to the holiday island. He is remorseful and wants to win Anne back at any cost.","popularity":1.303,"poster_path":"/ig58fz65I1NEVmuXDunBT4lZ0se.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zieglerfilm MÃ¼nchen","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein Sommer auf Sylt","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7}
