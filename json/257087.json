With Veil, it begins 30 years ago, when members of a religious cult known as Heaven's Veil take their own lives. The truth behind what really happened remains buried deep in the memory of the sole survivor, a five-year-old girl, who returns to the compound with a documentary crew as an adult. They soon discover something that is far more terrifying than anything they could have imagined.","popularity":7.951,"poster_path":"/e9hB3QrBIUDSHCmwbceVxVgLRqv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3172,"logo_path":"/kDedjRZwO8uyFhuHamomOhN6fzG.png","name":"Blumhouse Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The dead come back","title":"The Veil","video":false,"vote_average":4.861,"vote_count":233}
