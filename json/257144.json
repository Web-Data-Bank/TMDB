Out of curiosity, Karlina and her best friend Isabella decide to head to the village and strange things start to occur almost instantly. Karlina then learns about her family’s history from a recluse yet handsome villager named Armand (Zahiril Adzim). She finds out that her mother ran away from the village to stay away from a ‘haunting presence’ (‘saka warisan’) passed down by her grandmother.

Karlina then struggles to discover the mysteries that lie within her family curse, and whether she will be next to inherit ‘it’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ffnt1kFEhdz1rgBFpczOIDqMDgG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Senjakala","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
