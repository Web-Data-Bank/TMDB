Though he called himself a Makai Knight, Kiba was no different to a Horror. Kiba's spirit resides inside what was once a grey colored Makai Armor that's filled with the dark knowledge of Makai Power.

Kiba assumed full control over his host upon Meisha's defeat by Kouga.","popularity":2.968,"poster_path":"/nCZCm6JKjgwrvrjP4YbGBLm7C3x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1780,"logo_path":"/jdnvUiU7I3Uf2ig0VZNNjf0ORRL.png","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kiba Gaiden, Dark Knight Apocrypha","title":"Garo - Kiba: The Dark Knight","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7}
