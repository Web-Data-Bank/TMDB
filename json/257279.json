The anti-civil rights organization was hidden in plain sight in an unassuming office in the Mississippi State Capitol. Funded with taxpayer dollars and granted extraordinary latitude to carry out its mission, the Commission evolved from a propaganda machine into a full blown spy operation. How do we know this is true? The Commission itself tells us in more than 146,000 pages of files preserved by the State. This wealth of first person primary historical material guides us through one of the most fascinating and yet little known stories of America's quest for Civil Rights.","popularity":1.982,"poster_path":"/cDQ1DzBTMGuH6JgvWLj1uxWFsGB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72131,"logo_path":"/5TD0EPhPAESDJM5QyQFlPkaVXK7.png","name":"Trilogy Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spies of Mississippi","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5}
