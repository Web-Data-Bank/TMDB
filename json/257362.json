But he has a plan … a plot to infiltrate and debunk Pyrasphere, Hollywood’s fastest-growing, new-age religion!  Armed with only “The Truth”, he drafts his brother-in-law (Matt Price, TV’s Men of a Certain Age, Evan Almighty, Man on the Moon), a wedding/bar mitzvah videographer, and sets out to make his name.  Under the leadership of glamorous, fame-seeking guru Gossamyrhh (Maggie Rowe, Ocean’s Thirteen, Fun With Dick and Jane), the duo encounters a wildly colorful collection of cultists, including his ex-wife (Amy Stiller, Tropic Thunder, Zoolander, The Cable Guy).  But is Gossamyrhh’s philosophy actually genuine? Can Tripp really have it all through enlightenment … or is it a sham and part of a not-so-divine plan?","popularity":1.186,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not just a movie.
