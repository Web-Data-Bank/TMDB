Disappointed not to be assigned to a fighter but to a freighter, his co-pilot also isn't too keen on having a rookie flying his aircraft as he has only a short time before he again becomes a civilian. Their cargo is a civilian scientist, but they no sooner leave than she has new orders for them and a new destination. Although she’s less than forthcoming about the details, Adama is keen—particularly as it involves going into Cylon controlled space. However, nothing is as it seems.","popularity":10.962,"poster_path":"/fuHuvxnfcPXZauX1Pm7qwmc9k5L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26727,"logo_path":"/jeTxdjXhzgKZyLr3l9MllkTn3fy.png","name":"Universal Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome","video":false,"vote_average":6.747,"vote_count":146}
