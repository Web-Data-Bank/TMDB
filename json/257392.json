He has left their parents' home but still has not made an home of his own. Our protagonist’s alienation is palpable; for him life is a game, not because he chooses to make it so, but because he is unable to make anything more of it. But for those who befriend him and eventually turn him loose again, his game is not enough.","popularity":0.931,"poster_path":"/nbfbfPV3r4Q97JYyympbnn1rjQx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1968-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The game is life......the rules are Ernie’s.","title":"The Ernie Game","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
