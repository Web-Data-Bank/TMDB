Carlos does not want to accept this role and the only way he can think of to avoid the situation is to lie: every morning he goes out in his father's old suit to an imaginary job. Of course, to get the money his mother asks for, he will have to feed this farce day by day. And the lie will grow as tall but as weak as a house of cards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zG6eYSxayElsq8f1gbHAfEq3EPh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2003-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carlos contra el mundo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
