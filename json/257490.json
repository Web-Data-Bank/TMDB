One day, they find a piece of The Daughter of the Captain, a portrait of the crazy soldiers who returned home after losing the Spanish Colonies. In other occasion, they attend one of the limited performances of Valle-Inclán’s:The deceiving Mr. Friolera. They are just longing for the best premiere ever: the Second Spanish Republic, a drama on for a very short time. It was a beautiful dream thought, like the Esperpentos (strange-looking characters) of Valle-Inclán.
