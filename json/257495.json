Meet Juan (Juan Luis Galiardo, Goya Ward Winner for Best Lead Actor)... an unbelievably charming middle aged ladies' man who is still taken as handsome even though he has to disguise his belly, his white hair and his \"health\" problems. A series of amusing situations begin when Juan is torn between his daughter, who unexpectedly and inconveniently arrives into his life, and his latest - and failed - love affair. His failed attempts at trying to patch things up will have you not only laughing out loud but it will also leave you with a wonderful sense of love and family values.","popularity":1.123,"poster_path":"/CGjv7OqRrTHAYKeZEvKB8oY5LS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":697,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alta Films S.A.","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":9335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ Espa침a","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":37768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Galiardo Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":29566,"logo_path":"/wHbtRtUnXGNzX0riQIpq1fcgueq.png","name":"Atresmedia","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2000-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye from the heart","video":false,"vote_average":5.286,"vote_count":7}
