Lilith (Liz Vicious), the fabled first wife of Adam, has been awoken from her slumber with a renewed lust for blood. Due to her defiance of God, Lilith was damned to eternal punishment by having to walk the Earth as a succubus demon feeding on the strength and lust of innocent people. Legend tells that only the eldest daughter in the bloodline of Eve herself has the power to stop Lilith. That chosen one is Raven Riley. She is the one who bears the mark and she will not be able to come to peace until she has slain the succubus.","popularity":1.07,"poster_path":"/okcbctAAn5yJCxb2EK1z3vbDDzE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evil Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Raven Riley: Demonslayer","title":"Succubus","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":3}
