However, during the filming process in 2012, the story abruptly took a dramatic turn when lead singer Randy Blythe was arrested on charges of manslaughter and blamed for the death of one of their young fans in the Czech Republic. What followed was a heart-wrenching courtroom drama that left fans, friends, and curious onlookers around the world on the edge of their seats.","popularity":3.06,"poster_path":"/nIodUzFLmrvwP4VoDxrhtFnSmFT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4274,"logo_path":"/aUOQuqZATZ8wWzxDgIiY32px7Ok.png","name":"9.14 Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":7914,"logo_path":"/uVRzFVZP6bJIQOkOEegvbzPG2ID.png","name":"Epic Records","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The only way out is through the fire.","title":"As the Palaces Burn","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":21}
