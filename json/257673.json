Renowned Lithuanian documentarist Audrius Stonys took these words as a motto for his latest film, a meditative visual essay which portrays old people undertaking all kinds of activities, meditation and group laughter therapy. Without a single word of commentary, he creates from sophisticated, aesthetic images a compelling study of human corporeality which, in an ideal union with spiritual equilibrium, can sustain us with the pledge that old age doesn't have to be a painful wait for the last breath.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8EeuSyJUjPUjQ0mOyRLgS9W6c8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2006-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uku ukai","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
