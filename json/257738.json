Kate Sorin never imagined how volunteering herself as \"base citizen\" for Project Shell would determine her fate. The UNCORP claimed that the creation of the cyber-clones would be the bridge to a free and equal society, without thinking that their human nature would fight against the role they were created for: to be slaves.  Soon began the riots. The clones started a rebellion, trying to escape using any means. To control outbreaks of violence and retrieve escaped units the UNCORP created a specialized police unit, the CHD (Clone Hunter Division).  The individual 0258 escaped impersonating Kate, but everything went wrong and she saw herself forced to kidnap KateÂ´s daughter to survive, who died in the crossfire. Since that moment, Kate joined the CHD with a single goal, to find 0258 and avenge the death of his daughter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Project Shell","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
