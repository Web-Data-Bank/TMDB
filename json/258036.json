Documentary-style footage is combined with staged events. Despite the piece's lack of a traditional narrative, it bears some relationship to nature works.  The segment features material from \"Il Corpo Scuro (The dark body)\" - animals and natural environments are seen up close and at a distance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uyCnnpW52YZ35WrTkvHZXSGzmJN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":4}
