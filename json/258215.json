He knows his noble family would disapprove such a marriage; besides, he is nominated for the post of governor in Martinica. He promised never to forget Marie, but as time goes by, she will accept to marry a rich and unscrupulous man, Monsieur de Saint-André. When her husband is appointed to serve in Martinica as General Commissioner, Marie demands to go with him. At her arrival, all sorts of trouble arrive: pirates take action against travelers and goods, rotten deals set the two officers against each other, and finally jealousy settles to make things worse. ~ Written by Artemis-9","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/lfiCposROIHlxiYSnFDWec7Mma9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radius Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":75863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tibre Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1960-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marie of the Isles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
