THE MAN WHO MADE ANGELS FLY is a poetic story about a master of his craft that has inspired audiences to reflect upon common issues of suffering and the mortal coil. Visionary and un-biographic, imaginary tribute to the puppeteer.","popularity":1.124,"poster_path":"/s8ey6SJ6xYjjJL70ol4YB5otOeI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luna.W","origin_country":""},{"id":20618,"logo_path":"/yGDXyW0kQUMpraYo3f1egJSkxh4.png","name":"Les Films du Balibari","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2013-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Made Angels Fly","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
