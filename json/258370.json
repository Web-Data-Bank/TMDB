The plot concerns Ursus' attempts to rescue his kidnapped fiancee, aided by a pretty blind slave girl. Now an evil queen, Ursus' former love throws him into a gladiatorial arena with a bull, which manages to smack the slave girl in the head and restore her eyesight before Ursus defeats it and his enemies. The bullfight is particularly well-staged, and this exciting spectacle may be the highlight of Fury's erratic screen career. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi","popularity":1.607,"poster_path":"/3xSMg8p0sLNi68XzEWs7vjnmiPm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Marbeuf","origin_country":""},{"id":54532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Italia Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1961-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ursus in the Valley of the Lions","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":3}
