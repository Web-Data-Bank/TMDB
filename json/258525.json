It is based on the Russian war photographer Vladislav Mikosha’s diaries and photographs. He was filming at the front, but he also visited Hollywood during the war and became a star when he showed his pictures from the front. As Mikosha’s Swedish voice in “I stop time” we have Jonas Karlsson. Gunilla Bresky has made several award-winning documentary films about World War II. The most recent, “Night Witches”, is about female Soviet bomber pilots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3792,"logo_path":null,"name":"BOB Film Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":228,"logo_path":"/zT2bcTDEbBkfZi2APB8DYJKLIQ3.png","name":"Filmpool Nord","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":80086,"logo_path":"/ayx5AJqAMZNOSHPCZ1gx1ZiwX9Q.png","name":"Nordnorsk Filmsenter","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":33383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jabfilm","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story from World War II that is unlike anything else.","title":"I Stop Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
