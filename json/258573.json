It's quite obvious thanks to the chunky retro-futuristic look he captured with the interior design of the ships, which pay homage to that era of scifi. Beaulieu chose to marry a more stylized look for the characters with more realistic animation, which actually ended up working pretty well within the confines of this mini narrative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malaise","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
