While the sun was still setting behind the beautiful Chicago skyline, STS9 kicked off the night with a bang, going straight into “This, Us.” The powerful set contained the Liquid Horns supporting the band for several tracks delivering the brass tax. A beautiful mid-set “Circus” was played, and later in the set David Murphy commented on the full moon shining upon the crowd before playing a gigantic “Moon Socket.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"STS9: 2013.08.17 - FirstMerit Bank Pavilion, Chicago, IL","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
