It was the largest protest gathering yet, and it brought together a wide cross-section of liberals, radicals, hippies, and Yippies. Che Guevara had been killed in Bolivia only two weeks previously, and, for many, it was the transition from simply marching against the war, to taking direct action to try to stop the 'American war machine.' Norman Mailer wrote about the events in Armies of the Night. French filmmaker Chris Marker, leading a team of filmmakers, was also there.","popularity":0.831,"poster_path":"/yQbV5oLuZhQszZX7hf7gpJZPlJK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Societe pour le Lancement des Oeuvres Nouvelles (SLON)","origin_country":""},{"id":77233,"logo_path":null,"name":"France Opera Film","origin_country":""},{"id":745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Pléiade","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1968-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sixth Side of the Pentagon","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8}
