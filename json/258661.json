The film traces the history of modern homosexuality through the twentieth century, from early sexology and the nudes of Baron von Gloeden to gay liberation and cruising on the streets of Paris. Influenced by the groundbreaking work of Michel Foucault on the history of sexuality and reflecting the revolutionary queer activism of its day, \"Race d’Ep!\" is a shockingly frank, sex-filled experimental documentary about gay culture emerging from the shadows.","popularity":0.986,"poster_path":"/4kdmeosjHBq2z6wLOIZPfswncv5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Sisters Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A century of images of homosexuality","title":"Race d'Ep!","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":9}
