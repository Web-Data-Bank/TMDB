Some have been small and hard to understand and some have been big and overwhelming. During these times we want answers, don't we? We want to know why. Why do we have to suffer? Why do bad things happen to good people? We just want someone to make sense of it all. But we don't always get the answers, do we? Sometimes we are left wondering. And those can be some of the most difficult times. Maybe there are times we need to be released from having to have all the answers. And maybe it's when we're released that we are able to see there may be more going on here than we realize.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What do we do when there aren't nice, neat answers?","title":"Nooma Whirlwind 024","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
