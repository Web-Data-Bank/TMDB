It takes the form of two of femininityâ€™s mildest tokens, hair and embroidery, that serve here in the creation of a sexualised surrealist experience. Within the claustrophobic space of a table-lay, a forceful and erectile mass of hair comes alive and slithers across its surface. The hair probes into vessels and punches through the cloth till finally order overturns and all smashes to the ground.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o6phy55H1QEJDSAU08npVk3JvGD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Backcomb","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
