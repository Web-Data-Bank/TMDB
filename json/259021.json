It is a metaphor for the nation and its history. Like in the successful, award-winning \"La strada di Levi\", Ferrario sets off on a journey: this time, on the traces of the expedition of the Thousand. The aim: to verify the relationship between past and present, starting from Bergamo, formerly the \"City of the Thousand\" and today a bastion of Padania, and arriving at Teano. The voyage is full of surprises, meetings, reflections: a sweeping road movie through the history and geography of the country, seeking to answer a nagging question: why are Italians no longer able to imagine a future for themselves?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mNljZhHNhD9HxQ23vLU7BNDUlS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossofuoco","origin_country":""},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":26261,"logo_path":"/thn5VXJ5JegdrtiJn7mFuV2NWB6.png","name":"Film Commission Torino Piemonte","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2011-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piazza Garibaldi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
