Filmmaker Iriz P채채bo tells the highly subjective story of a complete hockey game using a new cinematic vocabulary she calls \"animbits.\" P채채bo readily admits she is not the biggest fan of Canada's national game, so the great, though highly underappreciated NHL stalwart of the '60s and '70s, Eric Nesterenko, was her hockey muse in this artistic journey.
