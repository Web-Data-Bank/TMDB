Spanish super star Carmen Maura plays a nun who agrees to a selfless scam, a fake stigmata, only to avoid separation from her lover, another nun.  It's a serious and passionate work, highlighting the theme of outspoken women-against-repression, seen in other good gay and lesbian films. This is not a lesbian \"Nun sense\" or another \"Dark Habits\" (by Almodovar, which also starred Carmen Maura, and also set in a Spanish convent, with some lesbian nuns).  Perhaps, best of all, 'Extramuros' is realistic and frank. It isn't shy about its characters' sexuality. Their sexuality, and the film as a whole are genuine.","popularity":0.898,"poster_path":"/sCdc3BkXmPV99G5MDKWlE8oFek4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1985-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Walls","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":6}
