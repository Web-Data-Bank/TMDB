More than 10,000 additional tons join them every year. It is the most dangerous waste man has ever produced. Waste that requires storage in a safe final repository for hundreds of thousands of years. Out of reach of humanity and other living creatures. The question is, where? Together with Swiss-British nuclear physicist Charles McCombie, who has been searching for a safe final storage site for highly radioactive nuclear waste for thirty-five years, director Edgar Hagen investigates the limitations and contradictions involved in this project of global significance. Supporters and opponents of nuclear energy struggle for solutions whilst dogmatic worldviews are assailed by doubt","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/js5Uq5YBBQjjsPbbiuyb4q0cMHx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182547,"logo_path":null,"name":"SRF Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen","origin_country":""},{"id":182652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mira Film Gmbh","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey to the Safest Place on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
