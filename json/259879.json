When a young documentary filmmaker goes into these tunnels to uncover the unseen stories of the people living below our feet, she finds out that there is more to be afraid of than the dark. A mysterious figure, living beyond the reach of the law, has declared war on the outside world that threatens to tear apart the fragile underground society living in the tunnels and maybe even the city above it.","popularity":2.666,"poster_path":"/zs585fjrUynVql5TKvovZ4A8rLz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3835,"logo_path":"/4gD398zUF6VaBti3sVjJkr0sDUX.png","name":"Odyssey Motion Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"20 Ft Below: The Darkness Descending","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":19}
