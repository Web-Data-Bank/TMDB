A football match unites men that have nothing in common with each other. The stadium becomes a modern Greek theatre, where five dramas touch one another, only to fade away in a few minutes. The main characters are, Simone, Alice, Gabriele, Pietro and Achille, all different types of people, of different ages, all looking for a place to find some peace and quiet, a taste of happiness and love, as well as someone to trust in. At the last stage people laugh, but there is always a bitter note to their laughter. And their laughter is louder and more satisfying the greater their adversity. Indeed, in the end, there is always a reason to go on, a final stage from which to rise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wTYeot0MVoKDavffj63HR0hrfLk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hera International Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2002-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultimo stadio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
