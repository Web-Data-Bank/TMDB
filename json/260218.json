In O’Neill’s playful film, “trouble in the image” may take the form of a disturbing moment in a narrative, how-to instructions for creating an image, or pictures that break apart and lose their literal meaning. O'Neill: “The film [is] made up of dozens of performances dislodged from other contexts. These are often relocated into contemporary industrial landscapes, or interrupted by the chopping, shredding, or flattening of special-effects technology turned against itself. The reward is to be found in immersion within a space of complex and intricate formal relationships”.","popularity":0.68,"poster_path":"/6C7uJXgf5F7h27sdWi3ondDoEOt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trouble in the Image","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
