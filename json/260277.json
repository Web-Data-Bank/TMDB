New Zealand’s very own Lloyd Geering, now 89 and still deeply involved in the debate of ideas about life and religion, and latterly, the very survival of human beings and the planet to which we belong.  The documentary explores his world view in a series of controversial and richly illustrated statements, and in doing so, makes simple and comprehensible the powerful theological and cultural ideas underpinning western civilisation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Top Shelf","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2007-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Western Heretic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
