Cohen’s “search for images” began at a time of extraordinary flux, as the Berlin Wall was dismantled—opening borders yet ushering in a nascent wave of consumer capitalism. What he saw struck him as a profound paradox: the moment Eastern Europe was revealed was simultaneously the moment it was hidden by the blinding light of commercialism. Cohen’s images are neither the tourist’s roster of picturesque vistas and monuments, nor the mass media’s definitive catalog of dramatic moments. Instead, he focuses on details, ordinary objects, and forgotten places—filming daily life as seen on the street.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5QFvDAKI5BMbBuS9m0SpcqELE4c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buried in Light","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
