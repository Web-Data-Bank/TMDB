He had to defend his dignity against insults and village gossip. It took little to stoke the fire once lit, and no one was immune. One of the worst humiliations a man can suffer was to have an adulterous wife. A man so disgraced would bear the mark of shame, with all eyes of the community upon him. It was said that \"his horns were sticking out\" for all to see.","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":"/A8oxzcb79xtZIpI6rLUp7kthpQW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2694,"logo_path":null,"name":"VIP Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2003-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cuore scatenato","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
