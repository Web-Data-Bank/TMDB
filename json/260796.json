While Rodrigo may have attempted to put his past life behind him, the memory of his now deceased mother and his old-world family returns to haunt him. In an old city dominated by the weight of tradition, Rodrigo discovers a daughter about whose existence he had never known, as well as a grand-daughter, the enigmatic and beautiful Octavia. A rebellious teenager, Octavia dismisses her grandfather's old politics, possessing her own sense of what freedom means. Patino's film is a poetic, assured contemplation on the pain of returning somewhere you never really left and the accompanying ironies of a man obsessed with history who cannot face his own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7uWwX9RrxZ0oE38ydCpYaZAz9NA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8174,"logo_path":"/nhX2rE2Owfr1wnomZ3o4eEh4QdZ.png","name":"Lanterna Magica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":9335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ España","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2002-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Octavia","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
