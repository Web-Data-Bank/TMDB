And then there was a storm, a real storm and not a metaphorical one, that flooded his house and submerged, and subsequently damaged, the only copy of Tagalog. This damaged version, entitled English, became the missing piece that completed the film. The new work is named after Taglish, the bastard hybrid, some say corruption, of Tagalog and English, and has become a meditation on love and language and the ways in which we betray and destroy them.","popularity":1.094,"poster_path":"/2LBeLHxE4SWJkpHlNJWGKsqj3qy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60376,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tito \u0026 Tita","origin_country":""},{"id":58343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barong Tagalog","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taglish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
