Her clothes fall off in almost every scene as with the help of a young handsome man she seeks a resolution to the mystery surrounding the murder, and the meaning of a block of wood with cryptical markings. Femi runs afoul of a bunch of idiotic gangsters, including a mob boss whose trademark is a red rose which he carries with him at all times. Some other girl is taking her clothes off a lot as well. Eventually they wind up in a weird sex club and then a graveyard.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":"/wA1LE4ox6HMpDxNCMuhaK02yG6n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78271,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Daunia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mala, amore e morte","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
