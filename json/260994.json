Considered by many viewers the best Brazilian movie ever made, this feature has never been released commercially. However, in a great paradox, Mário Peixoto has never made any other movie. The director Sérgio Machado pays a great tribute to the life and work Mário Peixoto a.k.a. Maçarico by his close friends with this documentary, using his diary; footages of \"Limite\", the never concluded \"Onde a Terra Acaba\" (1933) and the short \"O Homem do Morcego\" (1980); and interesting testimonies of Olga Breno, Ruy Solberg, Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Walter Salles among others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/82rH7RzVWdz3AjFUKgzmO8h9ps4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2002-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Edge of the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
