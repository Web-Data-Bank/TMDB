To do that, I had to create my own (all encompassing) vehicle. By my count, the original sequence provides three orders of motion: the motion (and stillness) of the passengers on the train, the motion of the train itself, and finally the motion of the girl (Joan) outside of the train.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Possessed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
