Finding that their strong religious convictions and faith seemed to be used against them, these are the personal stories of people who have participated in \"ex-gay\" ministries and found in fact that they did not provide a so-called cure. The answers seemed to come from within. With less of a focus on the \"ex-gay\" movement, the film is more about the telling of stories behind the debate and the role religion can play in one's life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iAnmQ2DoHfKaJFoTKJf6DxVVeOg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fish Can't Fly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
