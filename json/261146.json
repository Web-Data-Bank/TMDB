Athens is in the midst of a financial crisis. The camera documents mournful images of dereliction, desolation, and decay in the city center and the suburbs. The open air cinemas of Athens resist; they thrive as landmarks and touristic attractions; they recover their initial traveling form and activity by filling backyards, parks, central squares, and becoming the connecting tissue of a terrified society in crisis. Will the open air cinemas of Athens, a cherished form of communal entertainment, keep on creating an oasis and an escape amidst the bleakness of everyday life, or will they suffer heavy blows from the recession?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2013-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2013 Open Air Cinemas In Athens","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
