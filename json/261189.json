She took this opportunity to bunch up with her boyfriend Michael, best friends Jackie and his wife Carol. Although Michael convinced her that the couple had moved to Macau, incidentally they met each other on the street. Maggie couldn't believe her own bare eyes that Jackie was already addicted to cocaine. And the most absurd fact that Michael was the drug dealer himself. Jackie owed the mob a great deal of money; and one of the gangster, Chau Sung was determined to force Jackie to the corner.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/4BtaSWbC8OFkUrm8Tqmu0KSDvZZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22060,"logo_path":null,"name":"D \u0026 B Films Co.
