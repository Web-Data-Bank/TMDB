The crooked cop who put her there offers to procure her release and reinstatement - if she'll go undercover as a bar hostess to spy on the triads. The whole thing's a setup, of course, and soon Maggie is on the run from the law, as well as nursing a bad heroin addiction. She finds refuge in the criminal underworld, where she accepts a job as an undercover assassin. But when her identity is exposed, Maggie has both sides of the law gunning for her life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h2CQ9EdtrGpQQ03P47P7MBSgXMx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panasia Films Production Co.
