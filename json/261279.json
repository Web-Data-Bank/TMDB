Lorinc Parcen Nagy is the offspring of an upper middle class family, whose life is marked by two violent deaths: the suicide of his father and the slaughter of an innocent worker. He breaks with his family and his mother in disgust; she is of weak character, a person who abandoned her own husband. He is also unable to discover the right tone with his colleagues and his lover who is an illegal party worker.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":"/xsj5Q2fJtOujblsEXeCcxjk7kpD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Budapest Játékfilmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1975-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"141 Minutes from the Unfinished Sentence","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
