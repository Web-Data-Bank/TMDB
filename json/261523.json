Suddenly the photograph is \"released,\" electronically brought to life for one heightened, anecdotal moment — a single gesture, a punctuating sound — and then frozen again. Witty and often poignant, these revelatory documents of time, place and memory denote a fleeting, ephemeral reality. A 32-minute version also exists, featuring additional postcards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Postcards","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
