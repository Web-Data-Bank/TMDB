Set in a spacious country home peopled with a wide-ranging cast of characters, the drama begins as the friends of a widow come to console her on the loss of her husband. But at one point, the widow goes upstairs, encounters her husband, and is faced with his accusations about the past. This event and others provide the means of revealing the petty, self-serving, egocentric, and romantic pursuits of the melange of people in the house. - Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/rCUL443Sf4E9n5szTYtALVqQktu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centro Português de Cinema (CPC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1972-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Past and Present","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":7}
