Suddenly shots ring out from a hidden sniper, the Germans are killed, and the parachutist scurries away into the forest. The sniper is a woman, the number one partisan terrorist on the German hit list, and her adversary is the German number one exterminator sent direct from berlin to eliminate her. The battle is on, orders from high command - capture herâ€¦ alive. Both are professional, but now the hunter becomes the hunted.","popularity":0.66,"poster_path":"/qh6bOKr1GJMh9DOdQEquGzf4Gvp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Group W","origin_country":""},{"id":8950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dubrava Film","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":46152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Francesca Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1969-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ravine","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
