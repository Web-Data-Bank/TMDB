This is immensely watchable simply for the presence of Maria De Medeiros, the central two of the film are captivating. What spoils it is the stereotypical and under developed second characters and an overly wistful outlook. But I defy any man watching this film not to fall madly for Aimee and everyone will cherish the scenes between Aimee and Maurice.","popularity":1.45,"poster_path":"/p5Il9xNbngb58aaYdn8xYEbluBx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Optima Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The wonderful world of Aimee","title":"L'homme de ma vie","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
