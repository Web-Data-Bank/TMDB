Using original and archive footage and covering over fifteen years as a group, Pansy Division: Life in a Gay Rock Band is a fast-paced, intimate and humorous account of one of rock's most fearless acts. From their first days in San Francisco's underground music scene to a full-fledged stadium tour with Green Day and beyond, founding members Jon Ginoli and Chris Freeman overcome increasingly difficult line-up changes, prejudice and near-poverty to keep the band together and create music that has truly made a difference.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j28EfIIbw4v6Qy8QhMwHdlKs8nJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pansy Division: Life in a Gay Rock Band","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
