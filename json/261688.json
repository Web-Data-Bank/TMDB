The unrelenting wind of the season disrupts a landscape of inaction, theft and drug use. The end of innocence has already begun and a new path, dark and hopeful, stands waiting like the ships beyond her window. It will be an act of violence that thrusts the girl into womanhood and leads her to a new life where, not without pain, everything is possible.","popularity":1.021,"poster_path":"/2QXwfgW00vu7eFCQ4lTBHBfF4F2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Looking for Morphine","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":6}
