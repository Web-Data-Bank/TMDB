During this intensely condensed period, a lifetime of drama plays out. Robert (Jenkins) fights a zero sum game to reclaim all that his illness stole from his family. A debate rages on patients’ rights and what it truly means to be free. Jonathan reconciles with his father, reconnects with his mother (Archer), sister (Brown-Findlay), and his love (Adams) and reclaims his voice through two unlikely catalysts – a young, wise-beyond-her-years patient (Barden) and a no-nonsense nurse (Hudson). Through this intensely life affirming prism, an unexpected and powerful journey of love, laughter, and forgiveness unfolds.","popularity":5.32,"poster_path":"/mHINfhbI9iWHd8dnlDZtwvdOwMW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avenue Picture","origin_country":""},{"id":115700,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metalwork Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What do you say when everything has been left unsaid?","title":"Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":50}
