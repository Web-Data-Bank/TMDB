Failing to find any takers among the people whom he deemed responsible and respectable, Municipality takes up the onus of finding the mother of that abandoned baby himself. Municipality's rock steady determination ultimately helps him emerge a winner against all odds as he reaches that baby's mother but in bargain he loses his most precious possession, the flawless and god-like image of a mother he used to see in his dreams and probably the hope that he'll ever find his own mother again.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/iKf10QwK49hhGmKWeZyZ1uHX922.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quantum Films [in]","origin_country":""},{"id":34,"logo_path":"/GagSvqWlyPdkFHMfQ3pNq6ix9P.png","name":"Sony Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2010-03-05","revenue":2000000,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on 12.66 million true stories","title":"Thanks Maa","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":3}
