He is, however, very unpopular with King Charles X, who is the target of much of Debureau's scornful jests.  That would be a somewhat tolerable situation if it weren't for the fact that Debureau has fallen for a countess, who happens to be the King's mistress.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/90Q9yPHLPNajnRkxWhBczxCazzV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic-Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1938-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tanz auf dem Vulkan","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
