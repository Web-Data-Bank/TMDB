The rigid compositions create something like a pure state, which constantly changes during the period of its viewing – like an empty and simultaneously detail-packed field. During this period the viewer is challenged to find and occupy his own position, to find his perspective in a similar way the filmmaker has found his in several places. Festival combines places the artist has visited during the last few years. Jean-Claude Rousseau’s films not only make beautiful discoveries, they are beautiful discoveries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4y2ggDP6anCpLystXXdBvlIe1tS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
