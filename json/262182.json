The controversial figure spent 17 years designing the Vittoriale, a state museum on Lake Garda, and furnishing the Villa Cargnacco, which is part of the grand complex. This unusual documentary resulted from a photography session in the villa, when four friends—cinematographers Irene von Alberti, Elfi Mikesch, Klaus Wyborny and Heinz Emigholz—simultaneously filmed the rooms and furnishings of the villa in their own specific styles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pryvzCQR6n8kJFAb25Eh2nfnqGi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17178,"logo_path":"/eXbcwmrHmVmgmRFPoYZfbLkt884.png","name":"Filmgalerie 451","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"D’Annunzio’s Cave","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
