The film wraps with an extensive section devoted to one of Phish's grand festivals, \"The Great Went,\" where 70,000 fans descend on the tiny village of Limestone, Maine, for a spectacular multi-day musical event. Director Todd Phillips, best known for his groundbreaking films, Hated (The GG Allin Story) and Sundance Award-winner Frat House as well as the blockbuster comedy Road Trip, reveals the fascinating phenomenon of the band — its music, loyal fans and spectacular live shows. Phillips presents a compelling film that every music fan will find fascinating.","popularity":2.16,"poster_path":"/Aj07eqJnpVm8vC7ZH32r5dqLNeo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4472,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aviva Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":167413,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stranger Than Fiction Films","origin_country":""},{"id":167414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bittersweet Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phish: Bittersweet Motel","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
