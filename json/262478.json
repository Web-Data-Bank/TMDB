Again hard places played against drifting sounds from unseen sites beyond the image; the images and sounds, repeated, become inflections of each other. But this time there are historical inflections; Rousseau's film, like Straub's, takes place in a sort of meta-history as characters and ancient sites each become products of outside light and shadow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/go0KBp3XGcwLwC1HL7PozTKNNYZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15261,"logo_path":"/wgKSrQW5yw07bT1TR0iTRO6FD2d.png","name":"Capricci Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Antiquities of Rome","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
