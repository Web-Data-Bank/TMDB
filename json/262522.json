If looks could kill, they'd look like Traci: young, innocent, appealing, deadly. Traci clings like ivy to her devoted mother and strikes with a vengeance at any man who intrudes on their relationship. Traci's mother is an attractive woman with a healthy sexual appetite, and the attention she pays to the men in her life, whether for business or pleasure, sends Traci into a frenzy of jealousy and rage. Now Traci, using her budding sexuality, will do anything... seduce anyone... murder everyone who threatens to come between them.","popularity":1.798,"poster_path":"/cmCTuSFHzA5LBbJmDGTo4gl4pAS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quality Films Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":4724,"logo_path":null,"name":"BLT Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She's mommy's little girl... and she'll do anything to stay that way.","title":"Poison","video":false,"vote_average":2.3,"vote_count":3}
