The 2500-year-old drama of the woman who defied the state to bury her brother is transformed through stark, ceaseless movement, haunting sounds and music (including themes from Glen Branca, David Van Tieghem, Elliot Sharp and Diamanda Galas) and words of outcry against our own world's injustice.","popularity":1.126,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antigone/Rites of Passion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
