He is interviewed/provides voiceover in Estonian/Russian with subtitled English translations. Concert rehearsals (The Hilliard Ensemble/ Western Wind Choir/Paul Hillier) (unknown Finnish choir &amp; orchestra/Eri Klas) and a studio session (Arvo Pärt: Yamaha DX7 keyboard, Jan Garbarek: tenor saxophone &amp; Manfred Eicher: engineer) for the unreleased recording of what is reputedly Aetos are shown. Also a few minutes of the Kremer/Grindenko/Schnittke /Sondeckis Tabula Rasa performance is shown which would lead one to think that there is a complete video recording of that as well as the WDR Radio recording used for the ECM release. The tone of the documentary alternates from serious interviews/work to humorous scenes of Pärt clowning around and German \"man on the street\" interviews with people being asked \"Who is Arvo Pärt?\". Overall, a fascinating view into Pärt's work and lifestyle. - Alan Teder","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qPzH0uk175PukhXATWP2GMJygxm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arvo Pärt: And Then Came the Evening and the Morning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
