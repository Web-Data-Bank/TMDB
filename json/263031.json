Ulmer’s musical version of David Pinski’s play Yankl der Shmid. Singing, dancing, and flashing his eyes, Oysher gives his most robust performance as a passionate shtetl blacksmith who must struggle against temptation to become a mensch. Recently rediscovered footage makes this the most complete extant version of Ulmer’s lively folk operetta, replete with an example of Yiddish swing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fN9MC99IEuWQpvIPB1c84nF1uH1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Collective Film Producers Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Singing Blacksmith","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
