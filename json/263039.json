But Volume 7 is also jam packed with newly unearthed treasures, featuring singing rabbis, petulant news anchors, coughing snake handlers, bodybuilding clowns, and two body parts never before seen in the festival! It's a celebration of a decade of Found. Record over and you'll die! Taped live at The Grey Eagle in Asheville, North Carolina.","popularity":1.247,"poster_path":"/94se9TZTKmQbTaF3bpeOfu7vgaS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Unearthing VHS monstrosities since 2004","title":"Found Footage Festival Volume 7: Live in Asheville","video":true,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
