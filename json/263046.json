A rope bridge which the locals call “The devil’s bridge” forms part of each and every event which takes place in a small village lost in the mountains of the Kyrgyz Republic. A platform driven by a huge winch which they have to pull with their own strength to cross the torrent is their only link with the outside world. But the director of the documentary wondered something else: “Does this bridge unite or does it actually separate?” Through the mist and over the thrashing waters, the inhabitants of the area glide along their ropes. A film, in the director’s own words, about ordinary people who live in an extraordinary place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74486,"logo_path":"/pLkapE3cPFdM0695eoawyNavr06.png","name":"Kyrgyzfilm","origin_country":"KG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KG","name":"Kyrgyz Republic"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
