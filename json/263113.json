In Dah be alaveh Chahar (10 + 4), though, circumstances are different: Mania is fighting cancer. She has undergone surgery; she has lost her hair following chemotherapy and no longer wears the compulsory headscarf; and sometimes she is too weak to drive. So the camera follows her to record conversations with friends and family in different spaces, from the gondola she had famously used in her first feature to a hospital bed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 + 4 (Dah be alaveh chahar)","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
