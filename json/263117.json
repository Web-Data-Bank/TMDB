Thurber reveals that Pickman (Timmis, Kreating Karloff), a man he was using as a source for a Paper on Weird art, is linked to his recent change in demeanor. It begins with a simple invitation to view Pickman's work at his isolated studio in Boston's North End. And ends with the apprehension that what lurks in the foreground of Pickman's work is far more sinister than the art itself. Adapted from the original short story \"Pickman's Model\" by: H.P.
