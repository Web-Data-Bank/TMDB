When Elliot hears that a neighboring town has pulled the permit on a hippie music festival, he calls the producers thinking he could drum up some much-needed business for his parents' run-down motel. Three weeks later, half a million people are on their way to his neighbor’s farm in White Lake, New York, and Elliot finds himself swept up in a generation-defining experience that would change his life–and American culture–forever.","popularity":10.364,"poster_path":"/nfvmClvZE7KhIqB74OAgLQ2L6KW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10146,"logo_path":"/xnFIOeq5cKw09kCWqV7foWDe4AA.png","name":"Focus Features","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haishang Films","origin_country":"TW"},{"id":199801,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taking Woodstock","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-08-26","revenue":9975737,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Generation Began In His Backyard.","title":"Taking Woodstock","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":377}
