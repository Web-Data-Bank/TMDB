At least before, he had some idea what he needed to do to get by, and even if he never made much money with his myriad schemes, they got by. Kati has got a real bug in her ear about their livelihood, and is hounding him to get into the spirit of the new system. This is troubling enough for the old gent, but when he runs into an old mistress (Kati Lazar) and discovers that he has a grown son he has never met or knew about, his life becomes even more confusing. His slimy ex big-shot brother-in-law (Istvan Avar) is a major player in the new entrepeneurial risk-taking, and he beseiges poor Ede with advice as well. In this topical comedy, all these worrisome things, and more, come to a head at a big family celebrtion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9mzGdFJflwP2TQNMr1k8c3V3wrZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whoops","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
