The (West) German military intelligence services want to acquire her farm. At first, their agent attempts to buy the property openly, but her refusal to sell motivates him to try far shadier techniques. He comes up with a relative she never knew about who is entitled to a share in the property and tries to blackmail the township's mayor to get his cooperation. However, the hard-working and honest old lady has an ally in the person of her more sophisticated border, a woman who works in the mayor's office and has been to the West. She takes great delight in foiling the underhanded agent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cZ3coSOpjF3C4XPKXuRnEQFd5Jr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rising to the Bait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
