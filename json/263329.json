Her father is away serving in the army and her mother has sent her to a rural village to stay with her grandmother, a cafe proprietor. In that ironically idyllic setting, Gudrun frolics with a youth who yearns to join the Hitler Youth, though his father is a pastor who has been outspoken against the regime and will soon be arrested.
