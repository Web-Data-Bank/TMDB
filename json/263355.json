At least, that's the way his rescuer Bruno (Bruno Ganz) sees it. Besides, Bruno needs such an overly enterprising fellow to help him pull off a really big heist that he's been planning for a long time. It takes some doing, but the boy and his girlfriend are recruited by the older man, who has been keeping a low profile by working as a gardener.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iE30lQUplSlmIQIzzeoV7h7PmjY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11817,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imago Film","origin_country":""},{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bankomatt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
