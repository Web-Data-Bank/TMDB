En route she meets the gentle banker James Quick. Whilst navigating her relationships in London, including with a political poet bound for the Spanish Civil War, she experiences a transformation in her understanding of love. Based upon Christina Stead's best-selling Australian novel.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/oZvvxzKVWdf83aQQpIAvyDfzrA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22040,"logo_path":null,"name":"UAA Films","origin_country":""},{"id":126586,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Australian Film Commission","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":22041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Western Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1986-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Love Alone","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":5}
