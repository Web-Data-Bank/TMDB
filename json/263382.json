Within one family, the younger son is jealous of the praise his father gives to a Polish POW who is working for them under very difficult conditions. Within the village as a whole, the French, Polish, and Russian POWs are kept under guard by Nazi soldiers, creating a tense situation all around. But more importantly, the village has conspired to hide an Austrian deserter in a cave up in the mountains. This act of rebellion on the part of the deserter and the village hangs in a precarious balance that could be upset by a single traitorous comment to the Gestapo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qyBTkOrRIDbL8RDAFdGlo9llgz7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":136369,"logo_path":null,"name":"MARWO Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":32959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Voissfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1986-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hideouts","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
