Pennebaker, Jonas Mekas, among others. In long conversations, they discuss the elaboration of titles that are now fundamental to the genreâ€™s world history, commenting on the introduction of new light and portable cameras that allowed the advent of Cinema Verite, in addition to sharing the fundamentals and principles of the art of capturing life. The sum of these parts corresponds to a singular opportunity of re-encounter with the thinking of these masters, even those that have already passed away.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cP5e6mCQSKECa4g41qoDMPXbybl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Observing Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
