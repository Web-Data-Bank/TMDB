In the fictionalised story, Paula Barretto is caught in this underworld because her father was involved in the drug business, her brother is in the real estate scam, and her lover is an armed thief. Although she tries to get out of her corrupt and dangerous environment, it is not an easy task when even the police officers cannot be trusted, and the underworld has informants everywhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aw5O2X8CKIPOJGbVITOd3FhrMFB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Babylone Films","origin_country":""},{"id":7248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Union Générale Cinématographique (UGC)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":29485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Top n°1","origin_country":""},{"id":79997,"logo_path":null,"name":"ODEC","origin_country":""},{"id":1579,"logo_path":"/otPDzB7wHCUsDH0BzKy3DQ7sTWP.png","name":"FR3","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cap Canaille","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
