B端chner wrote a kind of declaration of peasant rights against the tyranny of the landholders of the time, and once that declaration (\"Der Hessische Landbote\") was made public, B端chner escaped to Strasbourg, and then to Zurich where he was killed in 1937, at the age of 23. Pastor Weidig was captured, sent to prison, tortured, and killed in prison. The revolution the two men had hoped for died on the vine due to an informer -- a planned uprising was brutally squelched -- and the peasants had to bide their time for another 12 years before the 1848 Revolution would bring them some of the rights demanded in B端chner's pamphlet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A German Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
