What's the street-level experience of voters in today's America? In a triumph of documentary storytelling, ELECTION DAY combines eleven stories--all shot simultaneously on November 2, 2004, from dawn until long past midnight--into one. Factory workers, ex-felons, harried moms, Native American activists and diligent poll watchers, from South Dakota to Florida, take the process of democracy into their own hands. The result: an entertaining, inspiring and sometimes unsettling tapestry of citizens determined on one fateful day to make their votes count.","popularity":0.628,"poster_path":"/cxwBGZyyX4bQY9Wp5OVt5TQnAjo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Election Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
