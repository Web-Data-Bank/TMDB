This did not make foreigners of any stripe very popular, and those from \"guest worker\" countries were particularly disliked. In this film, set in 1938, a half-Polish boy goes to Poland in search of his mother, runs into financial and psychological difficulties there, and is sent back to a Swedish mental hospital. In another story, an unfortunate woman suffers a miscarriage and ends up at the asylum where the Polish boy is being kept.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/avB0MFZFVLBtvXSLH2unahYJBay.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trekl√∂vern","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1979-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kejsaren","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
