Ismail, fighting with her to prevent an unscrupulous hotel owner from constructing a holiday resort on a nature reserve where turtles are preserved from extinction. Then, when his elder brother, Kai, and his family turn up unexpectedly, the diving instructor is confronted with his past... because the woman his brother married was once the love of his life, until she chose the other brother. Since then the two of them haven't said a single word to each other. Now the older brother announces that he wants them to be reconciled. Nobody realises at this stage that he is up to his neck in debt and plans to fake his death in Malaysia, so he can begin a new life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7IOd5TS2ciWjyRRFio9eojOfTgP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"On distant shores, a new life and love threatened by Passions from the Past","title":"Reunited in Malaysia","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
