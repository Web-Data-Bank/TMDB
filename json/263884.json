Lifeless dolls are heaped inside drawers, dolled-up life size figures lie motionless on a windy beach at the waterâ€™s edge; a chair rocks in an empty room, a mirror reflects and observes, and a chest of drawers is caressed by the sea. The film has a dramatic sensibility that sets up a false promise of narrative. Its structure, instead, is akin to that of dreams where different scenic spaces collapse and the inanimate and animate interchange. Wide-angled perspectives, shifting points of view and juxtapositions of sound and silence force inner and outer realities to collide, creating an unsettling psychic world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jNiQdZaxJBW45BnVvech2FeYa9Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
