All the 5 Bonds at the time are featured, though only Lazenby (reflecting in the usual frank, self criticizing manner), Moore and Brosnan granted an interview. Connery and Dalton are featured through some unused footage from LWT's 30 years of James Bond program. The ever faithful Desmond Llewelyn turns up in character as well as some other less related peeps like Christopher Lee, Paul McCartney and the ultimate playboy: Hugh Hefner -- who all give an interesting perspective on the worlds most famous spy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d416YCqX42GzWaX6uzRe8iCnGtd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6197,"logo_path":"/6LFn6YTFLtqNFkWw85csFErB2dv.png","name":"LWT","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of James Bond with Jonathan Ross","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
