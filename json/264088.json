The conflict became a religious war that resulted in a rebel Confucian army massacring hundreds of Christians in little more than a matter of days. The Uprising details the events leading up to the assault, focusing on the story of Yi Jae-su, the young man destined to become the leader of the rebel army.","popularity":1.286,"poster_path":"/tSO1fDlbbpPgK9zbx1FhnkOQ6j6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105936,"logo_path":null,"name":"KiHweck ShiDae","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":868,"logo_path":"/pWznyKg90dGoFpWQ5yAQ0Wdvde8.png","name":"Cinema Service","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":2256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de L'Observatoire","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1999-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Uprising","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
