When they’re not being rejected by producers who refuse to read their script, they lurk around bookstores and poetry slams shamelessly hitting on girls. They find some hope when the drug addled, cat-obsessed Gonzo Kapoor, the son of a famous B movie producer, hires them to write an art house film billed as “Tarkovsky with orgies” for his directorial debut. All seems well until Dulal meets Ruma, a beautiful photographer who makes him question his choice to sell out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ihQRKI6vhPJ8km95GgE92dyX8BK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tulsea Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2014-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sulemani Keeda","video":false,"vote_average":6.875,"vote_count":8}
