Aitana is a sweet girl trapped in a men’s body; Pierrick is a cute French gay; Rita doesn't much care about her partner, Carolina, and walks through life with no expectations; Jorge is trapped in a relationship with no future: the one he has with Maria.  Set against a background of drugs, sex, multiple partners and differing sexualities, Longing Nights follows the individual stories of these young people.  A candid portrait of four relationships highly loaded with eroticism from beginning to end. Four stories told without no borders between fiction and reality.","popularity":0.91,"poster_path":"/eBmwi6CSwv4TU32yHR2IVKHwgVF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2013-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Four people in Madrid trying to make their nights a little less lonely","title":"Longing Nights","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":8}
