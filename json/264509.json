Filmed with nine cameras on the Demon-Kiss-tour in 2004 in Dortmund and Cologne Germany, the producers employ a wide array of visual techniques. From the aesthetic of silent movies, via the fast-paced cut of video clips, to the naked documentary style the band gives each of the performed songs their fitting look. The DVD includes a wide array of bonus features on more than 40 minutes of playing time, ranging from backstage and tour bus-material, video clips, plus trailers and behind the scenes clips from \"Kinder der Nacht.\" This DVD is a fan's dreamÂ…perfect for any person inclined to the dark side of music.
