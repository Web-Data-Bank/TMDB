Transporting the women by covered wagon to Iowa, she soon realizes just how daunting the journey will be, and employs a low-life drifter, George Briggs, to join her. The unlikely pair and the three women head east, where a waiting minister and his wife have offered to take the women in. But the group first must traverse the harsh Nebraska Territories marked by stark beauty, psychological peril and constant threat.","popularity":11.206,"poster_path":"/eGpuOhkm1wG2AxEJShazH5NVGAO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2322,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Javelina Film Company","origin_country":""},{"id":6896,"logo_path":"/2Q89KvzxTKB5BAv9RqFIPI1qb7E.png","name":"EuropaCorp","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":122129,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ithaca Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-05-18","revenue":3442853,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Homesman","video":false,"vote_average":6.566,"vote_count":711}
