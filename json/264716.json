Historians discuss pedagogical Eros, Hirschfeld's theories and his institute of sexual science, and the Nazi's Paragraph 175, which outlawed homosexual behavior. Survivors describe intimidation and interrogation, the flight of friends, Himmler's edicts, and the confinement and death in concentration camps of gay men and women. The documentary ends at Amsterdam's monument to gay victims of the Holocaust.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iurb3bLQATYpvbWBFfYZRAQXkTm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desire","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
