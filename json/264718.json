With the murderer still at large, the coveted role of Lola passes to Tian, a talented but introverted dancer with a traumatic childhood. Suspicion fanned by jealousy soon leads to hostility and rejection from fellow dancers, while figments of childhood memories start haunting her every dream. Tian can only seek solace in the arms of her gaffer boyfriend Zhen. As the murderer strikes again, Tian begins to realize that all the slayings are somehow related to her. No sooner is she inextricably sucked into the curse of the role than she starts suspecting Zhen may actually be harboring a horrifying secret behind these murders and the troupe itself.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/yDC3Nbk2F9OTUolqeX88NwRATw9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5552,"logo_path":"/wdtjT9x5OG7nLusPctACI3i7Im2.png","name":"Media Asia Films","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":3407,"logo_path":"/iVMjKOFyRvm9PW45lW1wW6TSvnj.png","name":"Shanghai Film Group","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2005-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curse of Lola","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
