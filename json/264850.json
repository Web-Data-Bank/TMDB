Schiller is disgusted by the everyday routine of the military, always back and forth between breeding and drills. Conversation, conflict or even critique are discouraged – the oppression insufferable for the young rebel. Disgusted by the brutality, he writes his drama \"The Bandit\", which he would later publish anonymously. But following a frank conversation with the Duke, Schiller is dishonored and must leave the land.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5TrbWzpugamcMgeFPupSmRoj89u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis Filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1940-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friedrich Schiller – Der Triumph eines Genies","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2}
