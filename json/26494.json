We had documented the energy and efforts of a 20-year career together.\" However, the long-standing tensions between lead singer Ed Kowalczyk and the other three band members were boiling over. \"When the album artwork showed up with Chad, Patrick and I in black and white and Ed in color it shot pain through my veins.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hSYDanwhZrrANSC58z3aNRYogRy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live: Live at the Paradiso Amsterdam","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
