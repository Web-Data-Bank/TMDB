He is assigned to the Pavia Division on the southern line in Egypt. Rommel and the Axis forces are bogged down; it's October, the British prepare an offensive. At first, boredom, heat, hunger, and thirst bedevil the Italians; then the Brits attack, and there's no luck or heroism in death. Finally, it's retreat in confusion. Serra, his sergeant Rizzo, and his lieutenant Fiori take a last walk toward home. It's said that each soldier gets three miracles; when Serra's are used up, what then?","popularity":4.378,"poster_path":"/u2ZyDvt5rnMMCqWoXb2ryqKhg4e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10102,"logo_path":"/b0g4aEM39p0PwbIiaU1Cg3ZZUAq.png","name":"Cattleya","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":6246,"logo_path":"/7X6pfxldTiOD7MLo2EQqUQlmOUw.png","name":"Medusa Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":15139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tele+","origin_country":""},{"id":15868,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medusa Distribuzione","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":147913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Premium Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":34315,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kurt Media","origin_country":""},{"id":127332,"logo_path":"/zlHnt6mRYZ3CRZh0mPM9QhV9SCK.png","name":"Pandastorm Pictures","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":192507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Czech National Symphony Orchestra","origin_country":""},{"id":192508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Costumi d'Arte","origin_country":""},{"id":115198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medusa Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2002-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Alamein","video":false,"vote_average":6.464,"vote_count":83}
