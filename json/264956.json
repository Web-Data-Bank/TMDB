Their reservations are lost and Michael loses their luggage and money to a scam artist promising to get them a room. Suzie berates him and Michael, disenchanted with his nagging wife-to-be, gives in to the temptations that are all around them. He falls in with a free-wheeling motorcycle gang. Eventually his lover leaves him (Hemingway-style) for a bullfighter, and he and Suzie, having found their wild and independent spirit on the island, come back together.","popularity":1.354,"poster_path":"/pjcJGsOf0SoE4FHdXKgIwkXmAAn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6394,"logo_path":null,"name":"Geiselgasteig Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":10437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lisa Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild and Beautiful on Ibiza","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":5}
