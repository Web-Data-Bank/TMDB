This marriage of prudence heralds the beginning of a humdrum life, far from home, for Effi.

But then, one day, Innstetten's old regimental comrade, Major Crampas – a charming womanizer – arrives on the scene.","popularity":1.843,"poster_path":"/88TlG6nRUA17Sz52AFpQyyVZkQC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47,"logo_path":"/i7Z9ot2o3N5Sa3HrF09kniFs2y8.png","name":"Constantin Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":17051,"logo_path":null,"name":"MSM Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Effi Briest","video":false,"vote_average":5.132,"vote_count":19}
