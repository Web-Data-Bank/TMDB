Forming in 1969, Supertramp quickly rose in popularity and established themselves as one of the most popular of the crossover Art-Rock/mainstream bands. They became a staple on FM and had a string of huge selling singles and albums.  Their popularity began to fade in the 1980′s as musical tastes changed with Art-Rock falling out of favor with New Wave. The band eventually went on extended hiatus and reformed later with personnel changes.  But there was a time in the mid-seventies where you couldn’t turn on a radio without hearing at least one, if not several Supertramp songs in one sitting; all of which you knew by heart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Aq0nletpftdnQfQBh8dt8uIAd0f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supertramp - BBC in Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
