When November 11, an official holiday (Armistice), falls on a Tuesday, the public service often gets an extra day off on the preceding Monday, but only after a formal ministerial decision, and this time it gets all the way trough the hierarchy to the right office- and then isn't read, so all the colleagues turn up, only to be told they should have stayed at home. It gets worse: works in progress and clumsiness end up blocking the way out both by lift and staircase, so they are stuck on their floor, apparently without a phone, while there's nobody outside who can hear and rescue them. Forced to keep their conversation going, some secrets get unearthed, and it's not a very pretty picture they got of each-other.","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/xbkpgH1b20HjOEoF9wQJ0WHHIsY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De kollega's maken de brug","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
