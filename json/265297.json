He has witnessed the major events of our recent history: international conflicts, starvations and exodus… He is now embarking on the discovery of pristine territories, of the wild fauna and flora, of grandiose landscapes: a huge photographic project which is a tribute to the planet's beauty. Salgado's life and work are revealed to us by his son, Juliano, who went with him during his last journeys, and by Wim Wenders, a photographer himself.","popularity":11.795,"poster_path":"/jRmQNj8NacAHJnzwfvFvglKSGB6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72681,"logo_path":"/oE8q1gO5PLebdKo071tajq5SHtl.png","name":"Secretaria de Estado de Cultura do Espírito Santo","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":37048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Decia Films","origin_country":""},{"id":72677,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazonas Images","origin_country":""},{"id":72678,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solares Fondazione delle arti","origin_country":""},{"id":11246,"logo_path":"/4YZ5CQZkJa2FIKGtjLLoKhNOAIw.png","name":"La Région Île-de-France","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":72679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maison Européenne de la Photographie","origin_country":""},{"id":72680,"logo_path":null,"name":"Serviçio Social do Comércio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2014-08-29","revenue":1059804,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey With Sebastião Salgado","title":"The Salt of the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":8.1,"vote_count":538}
