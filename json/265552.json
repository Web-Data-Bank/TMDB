Stuck in prison, Frank was beginning to lose faith in everything he believed in until he becomes friends with Mando, a convicted murderer who denies his passion for dancing just to prove his masculinity and Allona, a transsexual who tries to contribute to prison reforms by teaching his fellow inmates dance exercises. They get involved in a tricky struggle between the positive changes initiated by the new warden and the corrupt system that weighs down the inmates' chance to become better individuals. Frank finds himself caught in an intricate web of lies and must choose between concealing what he knows to keep himself out of danger or to help his fellow inmates by revealing the truth. Will he remain on the sidelines as an observer, or will he dance the dance of the steel bars?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/neVwNt1SNSJaAxPHUNBYC7SB8o9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Portfolio Films International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"release_date":"2013-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance of the Steel Bars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
