After flying some distance, Abel discovers himself alone on a river island, unable to swim due to the powerful current. Abel periodically attempts to leave the island by various means: flying on a leaf, rowing a crudely fashioned boat, etc. Meanwhile, he tries to create a normal life of sorts, even learning to enjoy a new hobby: sculpture. Still, Abel's goal is to escape the island and rejoin his wife in the city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bQRtQz0A9fVk3lSvcq86wnlTDES.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1988-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abel's Island","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
