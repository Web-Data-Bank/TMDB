This fictionalized story of Jana, an eight-year-old Gypsy girl snatched from her parents and consigned to a life of orphanages and bleak foster homes, is based on a little-known chapter of Swiss history: From 1926 to 1972, the state-supported Pro Juventute, a children's aid foundation, forcibly removed some 700 Gypsy children from their families, in order to sever the ties with their culture and assimilate them to a \"better way of life.\" The underlying aim was to preempt a new generation's caravans from following their nomadic traditions along Switzerland's country lanes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/34l6Ry1NDxDbOblOjrW7PzU1A14.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141533,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panorama Films (CH)","origin_country":""},{"id":2687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lichtblick Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":224,"logo_path":null,"name":"wega film vienna","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of the Open Road","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
