Billy however, makes it his mission to give the Birthday Boy a day to remember! Taking him into town, he buys him a sexy present and takes him to a bar for some drinks. What Billy doesn't count on is Drake being distracted by sexy bartender McKensie Cross who whisks him into the back for a quick fuck. Billy might be disheartened, but he still wants to prove himself to Luke and show him that he is the one he wants. Billy speaks to his (morally compromised) friends and they soon organize an orgy to loosen up these lovestruck lads!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1yX6N8DsTRVpYiAy53mKblsx316.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19755,"logo_path":"/73BIyXqVgJsDWtgTCqeKsf1afVy.png","name":"Eurocreme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birthday Boy","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
