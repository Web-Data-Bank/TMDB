But there's something different about Jess. She can see and hear things that other people can't. When Jess is brutalized in a country lane, the ancient spirits of the area appear, angry and full of vengeance. The townspeople take the law into their own hands and commit a terrible act upon an innocent, as brutal and unforgivable as the notorious Witchfinders from centuries past.","popularity":0.913,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Vengeance Never Dies","title":"Molly Crows","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
