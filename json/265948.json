While visiting the Wax Museum a group of tourists stop in front of the figure of Prince Metternich. All of a sudden they find themselves brought back 150 years earlier during the Vienna Congress of 1814-1815. Before their eyes wide open, history is in the making. Gathered around the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I, the Kings of Bavaria, Würtemberg, Prussia and Denmark, are persuaded they are building the future Europe whereas they are being manipulated by foxy Chancellor Metternich, he himself under the thumb of cynical Count Talleyrand, the French representative. All those considerations come second though to partying and social life, which is all these aristocrats really want out of this congress.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/9t48Nvo4RbMZVGNKbdFy6bNf9XT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comptoir Français de Productions Cinématographiques (CFPC)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Melodie Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2111,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wiener Stadthalle-Station Betriebs-und Produktionsgesellschaft","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1966-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Congress of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
