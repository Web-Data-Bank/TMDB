The first segment, titled \"Last Day\" finds acrimony taking precedent over amenity during a farewell party for an employee who's about to move on. A bride and the priest who's officiating her wedding get an unpleasant surprise after running away together in \"Wedding Night,\" and a woman on the CTA receives a spontaneous gift that transforms her outlook on the world (at least, momentarily) in \"Flowers\". Lastly, a family preparing for a big relocation finds the forces of the universe seemingly aligned against them in \"Move\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22109,"logo_path":null,"name":"59 Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something Better Somewhere Else","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
