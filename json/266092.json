As Gorzo struggles with unpredictable weather, globalized markets and rocky finances, we marvel at his perseverance in the face of such uncertain gain. “As the months went by, we clearly could see the strain on John’s face,” says director Paul Eichhorn. “It really offers viewers the chance to see first-hand the challenges facing farmers today.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Growing Season","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
