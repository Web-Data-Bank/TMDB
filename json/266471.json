With the Big Town Playboys offering support, Beck rips through 18 Gene Vincent numbers (not \"Be-Bop-a-Lula,\" however), paying tribute to Vincent's guitarist, Cliff Gallup. Beck sounds terrific as he reconstructs Gallup's parts, but he doesn't add anything to the originals. Still, Crazy Legs is a fun listen and offers many insights into Beck's playing, if not Gallup's.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeff Beck - Big Town Playboys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
