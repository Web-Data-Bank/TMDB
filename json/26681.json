Adventurous, they spend most of their time jumping - for thrills and to escape what haunts them.  When his dream of becoming a pilot is shattered, Rafaël, a young daredevil of 20 years, puts his life in danger by pushing his limits as a parashooter. Her friend Charles, the older owner of the skydiving center, tries to make her understand reason while developing a love passion for Manu, a young woman who, at 20, has to deal with her mother's cancer. But Manu and Rafaël also develop a strong passion, which comes to compromise the strong bond between the three friends. Things don't work out when Rafaël, who has been forbidden to jump, comes to miss a particularly dangerous jump prepared by Charles.","popularity":1.366,"poster_path":"/9nZ0magTSDz7AsRYZzirL5Br7sc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13312,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Vision 4","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Fall","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":11}
