Sold as a limitless land expansive with free opportunity, California was actually, from its onset, fissured by the interwoven needs of private and public interests. Schmitt's film covers various locations through time, as the major industries of the early 20th century (mining, lumber, oil) give way to the military, eventually leading to multinational corporations, and the use of small towns as satellites for growing urban metropolises.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/h6XEngS4OiIkF88rpYGY6S0LbhG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"California Company Town","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
