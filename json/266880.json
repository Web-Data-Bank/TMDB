Set in some demented alternate universe (i.e. Ventura, California), they are populated by real-life alcoholics and drug addicts, trash-talking senior citizens and trailer park residents dressed in cow outfits and costume-shop wigs. Director Adam Rifkin creates a wildly surreal, outrageously funny and strangely touching portrait of a truly Outsider Artist inhabiting a world few of us even know exists.","popularity":1.477,"poster_path":"/84wEpo82TdGQV8yO7bv1yNw3wtf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blump International Films","origin_country":""},{"id":157585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemad Presents","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"WARNING: THIS FILM CONTAINS SENIOR CITIZEN NUDITY AND DEAD PIGS","title":"Giuseppe Makes a Movie","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":7}
