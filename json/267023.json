Highly experimental in nature that - like Marmite - will split its' crowd into ones that'll love it and others that'll loathe it. There's no middle grounds here.  The topics included are: The Hungarian Olympians' doping scandal, political terrorism, the national elections... and more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/KhMm634fiSrz0WpsDAztziX3UY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133056,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krétakör Alapítvány","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BLACKland","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
