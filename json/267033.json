In fact, everybody seems to have other things on their minds, except for the enthusiastic dance instructor and his ever-smiling assistant.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l43qCVm1BKSXk9HqOaknV8tNFjf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magyar Televízió Müvelödési Föszerkesztöség (MTV)","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":8100,"logo_path":"/1HuVRo0SYPSzYvduxVf4baaWqOI.png","name":"Mafilm","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1982-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cha-Cha-Cha","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
