Marie-Line (Muriel Robin) is a single woman in her mid-forties who oversees the cleaning crew at a large office building. On the job, Marie-Line is all business, with no patience for laziness and no tolerance for employees who do less than a perfect job. But Marie-Line's bosses are in the midst of a money crunch and they've cut back on her budget, so when several of her employees quit, she has to find new cleaners willing to work for a lower wage. Marie-Line soon finds new workers willing to work hard for low pay, but there's a catch -- most of them are illegal aliens, smuggled into France from Africa, Albania, or the Middle East, and when police begin asking questions about Marie-Line's new cleaners, she has to scramble to cover for them.","popularity":1.047,"poster_path":"/vU5iEUJBNUgIOXtjBB1e3iAe4ev.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fonds d'Action Sociale","origin_country":""},{"id":2360,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Chauve Souris","origin_country":""},{"id":183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Studio Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":23446,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofica Sofinergie 5","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marie-Line","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":6}
