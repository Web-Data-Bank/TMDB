A visual experience that enables the spectator to get to know the dynamic approach and the challenges that have taken the Roca brothers to the top. Images, matter, music, flavor and smell converge on this journey with guests such as Ferran Adrià, Zubin Mehta, Miquel Barceló, Freida Pinto, Sílvia Pérez Cruz and Harold McGee.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4iR5Ka8iWruFaJs2ocIbAEZOcz0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12010,"logo_path":"/37Yr7iuWGXk849o8osIQKTQSZY5.png","name":"Mediapro","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":33693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ajuntament de Barcelona","origin_country":""},{"id":30258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Generalitat de Catalunya - Departament de Cultura","origin_country":""},{"id":9974,"logo_path":"/jd5x1rD18FAswqv1tRwPJCSbRGz.png","name":"ICAA","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2014-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dream","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
