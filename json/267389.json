As indicated by the title, the film's script is a \"mufti\" version of Hamlet, with young Hardy Kr√ºger trying to prove that his uncle has killed his father. Direct references to the Shakespeare original abound, right down to the re-enactment of the crime for the benefit of the Uncle and the periodic appearances of the ghost of the hero's father.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c9d0FpY77P9PYI6yfkWsoZRx3hN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1959-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rest Is Silence","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
