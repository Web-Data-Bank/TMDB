Each of the tracks had never been released and with each of the three rounds, the excitement rose.. Mochilla never intended to release this DVD but since the tragic passing of DJ Dusk, they felt it was important to honor his legacy and share his gifts. This is for him: no edits, no overdubs, and no interruptions - just raw Hip Hop at its most exciting, vital and real.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DJ Dusk's Root Down Soundclash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
