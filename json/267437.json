Live At The Shrine takes place in the Kuti family’s hometown of Lagos at the Africa Shrine, where every Sunday Femi plays to a packed house of revelers. With music as his weapon of choice and the Africa Shrine a temple of protest song, Femi continues his father’s fight, railing against the corrupt Nigerian government and staunchly defending PanAfricanism. Capturing this experience through interviews, street scenes, and the music itself, Live At The Shrine captures the spirit, passion, and hope, of a man and a people who are fighting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j3DvoupOSEruY7FN9zGFvjfZA8E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Femi Kuti: Live at the Shrine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
