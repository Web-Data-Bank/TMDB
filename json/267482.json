The film greets us with the invitation \"meet anti-matter and the bride of the monster\", pointing to Keen's love of B-movies (and a reference to Ed Wood's The Bride of the Atom, aka The Bride of the Monster [1955] as it was later known).","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/n4eV5VJaPCCzrERssGGtn8VqRtH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Lite","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3}
