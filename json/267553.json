The film, rendered in text, focuses on the repetitive motion of foodstuffs being cooked in the lobby of a discount department store. Says Arcangel, \"I composed Urbandale by creating my own software and using ASCII (text) as the only means of display [...] I have 'frozen' a certain time and aesthetic in computer culture [...] The soundtrack for Urbandale was also composed by myself and recorded with 12 electric guitars\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u7797be4BqvLuasMOVXmdDoP2bI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urbandale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
