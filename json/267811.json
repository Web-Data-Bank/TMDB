In many ways there are two Paul McCartneys, the legend and the man. In The World Tonight reveals the man behind the public face, intimately capturing him at work, at ease and as candid as ever.","popularity":0.63,"poster_path":"/1TRwPQewsKJ4CrWSpU6oudeDol.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I go back so far, I'm in front of me!","title":"Paul McCartney: In the World Tonight","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
