Although not an overtly political work, for many viewers it raises sensitive issues about race, homoeroticism and violence. It depicts two naked men – one of whom is the artist – tussling and teasing one another in an encounter which shifts between tenderness and aggression. The film is silent but a series of stares, glances and winks between the protagonists creates an optical language of flirtation and threat.","popularity":1.088,"poster_path":"/cNmyFK2C1xHMn0vF37tkWFeBbU1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bear","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":6}
