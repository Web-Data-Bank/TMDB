An allegory to the phenomena of racism as an acquired cultural epidemic, the story discusses the question of the personal conscience of each of us, versus the education we receive from our families and environment. Can we really insist on our personal belief system, when what we must believe in, is dictated to us?  The film presents how easily we acquire fear and hatred of foreigners, as well as how easily we might become the \"strangers\" and \"others\" ourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strange Fruit","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
