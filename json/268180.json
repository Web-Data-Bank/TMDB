Full unadulterated terror (and music). 'The best class always ends with a lesson'. Almost baroque in its ambition and detail, Akerman and Seabra Lopes’ mesmerising short film delves deeply into the hard-wired dread of music lessons. Sewn around Schubert’s steely Opus 1, which is itself based on the no less terrifying legend of Goethe's Erlkönig, their film is a revelation.” International Film Festival Rotterdam.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Qss6Lsn6SjBWPhNiaSKhwMC0mP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9047,"logo_path":"/a0oCybecb96ieZY4139hb9uqYs1.png","name":"Terratreme","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2011-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The best class ends with a lesson.","title":"Fire","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
