Driven mad by his failure to sell a profitable film to the porn industry, a director decides to create authentic snuff films with the assistance of two teenage runaways and a perverted cameraman. When the films bring in a profit through an amateur internet production company, they begin to see the film industry for what it really is: a world of backstabbing and double crosses. The group of twisted filmmakers then extract their own form of graphic revenge on the very people who made them successful.","popularity":1.127,"poster_path":"/43gdh1cLcOiifc3h7roQTASlvdq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stoned Gremlin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kidnap.
