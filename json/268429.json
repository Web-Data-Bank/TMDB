Narrated by Don Cherry. Over an hour of best GOALS, HITS, SAVES, and BLOOPERS. You'll see such favorites as Wendel Clarke, Eric Lindros, Doug Gilmour and many more. My good buddies Tie Domi and the star of the ROCK' EM SOCK' EM series Bob Probert drop in for a visit (if you know what I mean), and I'll show you all the Montreal overtime goals as they marched to the Stanley Cup. Needless to say, COACH'S CORNER will be spotlighted. All this action is set to the sounds of Techno stars BKS and 2 Unlimited, and wait till you hear me in ROCK' EM SOCK' EM TECHNO! GOALS, SAVES, HITS, the odd TUSSLE...who could ask for more?","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/znBZWM6CCcdBJUT2VIejKSWQhvP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Cherry's Rock'em Sock'em Hockey 5","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
