Narrated by Don Cherry. Well here it is folks, what you've been waiting for - No. 6 in the series of my Rock' em Sock' em Videos (which are, by the way, the biggest selling hockey videos ever). And why wouldn't they be... they're the best of all time. We screen over 300 games to pick out the best stuff: SWEET GOALS, BEAUTY HITS, DYNAMITE SAVES. Marty & Probie drop in for a visit (and have a slight disagreement!). Of course there's Coach's Corner, Bloopers and a new feature: my tips on safety for young players. Over 1 hour of the best Rock' em Sock' em yet!\r They've all been great. But I think this one's the best.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/le4I3WYLlpVvbuYhQE7bjSNPSJL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Cherry's Rock 'em Sock 'em Hockey 6","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
