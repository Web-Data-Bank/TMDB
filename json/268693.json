Despite having made a great mural for the metro station Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre, Santos lives isolated and ignored in his country. This documentary follows his pilgrimage to Wirikuta, where he asks gods for permission to make a new mural; his journey across 385 miles of the Peyote Route, and Santos's creative process during the making of a new mural which aims to illustrate the history, mythology and religious traditions of the Huichol people.","popularity":0.925,"poster_path":"/iJzHS0LXCeOUZu02o8nNjwpgcHo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cuadro Negro","origin_country":""},{"id":11765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ithaca","origin_country":"US"},{"id":19771,"logo_path":"/anRmhRCSY9fXOIygcjjVHL4bWL1.png","name":"Piano","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2015-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echo of the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7}
