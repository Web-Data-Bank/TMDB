The nature of the miracle is a bit strange, but it comes in answer to Pater Malachias' prayers to get the sin-ridden place out of the center of the city. The good and naive Malachias is subtly played by Horst Bollimann. Once this miracle of relocation has occurred, the sharks and entrepreneurs, who would bilk both the faithful and the curiosity-seekers alike, crop up like an unwanted epidemic. The mercenary and the sacred clash, as many try to find deeper meaning in what has happened, and Pater Malachias starts to doubt the wisdom of his original prayer.","popularity":0.762,"poster_path":"/wAhmfE01KVggcsReC4oBhyKEuSN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Film Hansa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1961-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Miracle of Father Malachia","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
