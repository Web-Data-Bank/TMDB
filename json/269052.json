Filling London with plastic Easter eggs, he's on a rampage to make Easter \"bigger than ever!\" But just how hard can his mechanical chickens work before they're...well, fried? In just one unforgettable day and night, Cavis and Millward (Bob and Larry) and a music box angel named Hope (voiced by Rebecca St. James) must convince Nezzer that Easter is about more than just candy and eggs.
