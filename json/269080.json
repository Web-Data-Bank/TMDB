The way of crime is an easy way for them: a boy and a worker without a job or benefit are induced by 'el Señorito', the son of a rich lawyer. Together they form a band. Hard and violent, the film is made with a clear intention of social criticism and research of realism, culminating in a final scene that raised quite controversial.","popularity":0.711,"poster_path":"/53hs7DCHQtbW6GstXH0nsS6mPyc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productores Exhibidores Films Sociedad Anónima (PEFSA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1962-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los atracadores","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
