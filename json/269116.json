Aside from a tour of the scenic and historical wonders of the country, Mueller-Sehn spends a lot of time in Athens examining its famous attractions like the Acropolis. Perhaps over-long at its current running time, this docu introduction to Greece would certainly be ideal for anyone planning a first visit to the country.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":123677,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skouras Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1961-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreamland of Desire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
