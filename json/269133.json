She is the world's greatest female wrestling champion, she has a loving boyfriend and loyal family members who care and love her. But things take a turn for the worst when Mimi's boyfriend Nick is wounded and her younger brother is shot to death for trying to stiff local druglord Harry Lee. Lee is the toughest and meanest criminal figure in all of Southern California and if you double-cross him, you won't live to see the sun set. Not only does Lee rule his own empire, he also runs the Kumite, a gladitorial fight ring where warriors battle to the death. Mimi knows the police can't touch Lee with a ten foot pole and so she enlists the aid of her martial arts friend Master Vern to teach her kickboxing and tai chi so she can prepare for combat. Vern doesn't think Mimi is ready for Kumite, as it is a place where only one warrior can be left standing and breathing and the one who loses dies.","popularity":4.126,"poster_path":"/wfDqbw7mNrgBu8d77ea9PZxdjy5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imperial Entertainment Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":96445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Curb/Esquire Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A gladiatorial kickboxing duel-to-the-death","title":"Pushed to the Limit","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
