The story is adapted from a stage play by Walter Macken who also plays the role of the ex-convict Paddo in this screen version. Direction is by J. Fielder Cook. Once Paddo returns home after being sentenced to five years for killing a man, his old friends try to put him back in their niche of local hero but Paddo will have none of it. He is disillusioned and changed. His son Willie (Arthur Kennedy) walks with a limp that keeps him too self-conscious to assert himself as he would like with the young woman of his dreams. While other people come in and out of Paddo's life, from his taciturn friend the trapper to the local tinker, it is Paddo's son Willie suffering from his own disability who makes the difference in his father's life.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/dmPJy5zUjT3wRBFfQjMTe14UQmr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emmett Dalton Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1959-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Is the Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
