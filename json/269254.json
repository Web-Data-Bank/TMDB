While the movement is known for Cesar Chavez’s leadership and considered a Chicano movement, Filipinos played a pivotal role. Filipino labor organizer, Larry Itliong, a cigar-chomping union veteran, organized a group of 1500 Filipinos to strike against the grape growers of Delano, California, beginning a collaboration between Filipinos, Chicanos and other ethnic workers that would go on for years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Delano Manongs - Forgotten Heroes Of The United Farm Workers Movement","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
