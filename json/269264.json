In one re-enacted story, there is a wartime escape through the mountains, and in another, a daring rescue of a pair of climbers who had been missing. The actors themselves are adept at the sport of climbing, and they give the scenes an immediacy and real daring that brings the stories alive. A combination of their acrobatics and skill and the outstanding episodes in the history of French climbing creates a winning 78 minutes.","popularity":0.765,"poster_path":"/4DRMVf33rFOyllnVxslaLUeAiZJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Requin","origin_country":""},{"id":98887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmartic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1960-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Étoiles de Midi","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
