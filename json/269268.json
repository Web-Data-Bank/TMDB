This period drama is set during that early 19th-century war and focuses on one of its heroes, Sven Tuuva. Sven is a decent yet not too brilliant soldier, and his exploits are partly balanced here by the charms of a compatriot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A8ZLqWUKUwgKBT4V7SmqO98gszJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12982,"logo_path":"/uxMOBCbDYQesyTz1TmR6OCqz8XH.png","name":"Suomen Filmiteollisuus","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1958-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sven Tuuva the Hero","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
