Upon learning that a local catskin dealer intends to buy up all the local felines, the boys organize a boycott against the man. It's a uphill climb, since the dealer has the law and the government on his side, having spread a rumor that the cats were diseased and needed to be killed off. Thanks to the boys, who aren't above a little larceny and duplicity themselves, the villain is foiled and the world made safe for meowers and mousers once more. Kampf der Tertia is based on a popular children's novel by Wilhelm Speyer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eujErO5dodfYhStjl0raOEoP3NQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1952-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fight of the Tertia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
