The facts are in– terrorism as a mass threat is a hoax. It is government, and the elite who control it, that pose the real threat to humanity. This new film will serve as evidence to the fact that government is history’s greatest killer– with various regimes claiming more than 262,000,000 unnatural deaths in the 20th Century alone. Now, a 21st century technocratic global corporate tyranny seeks to kill not mere millions but billions– through their superweapons, central banking warfare model and eugenics mindset.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New World Order: Blueprint of Madmen","video":true,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
