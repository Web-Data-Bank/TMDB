Yasutomo is a man driven by his vision for learning and his passion for educating the heart as well as the mind. The film follows Yasutomo, his teachers and staff, students and their families over the course of one entire school year. The film is also the story of the families of Kanayama. Parents and elders of this once impoverished town embrace Yasutomo's vision, but not without wary glances back to the past. This small community, bound together by love for its children, is also defined by its journey through the cultural upheavals of postwar Japan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":23214,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Alaska Museum of the North","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart of the Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
