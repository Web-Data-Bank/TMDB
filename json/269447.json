The story of a stubborn journalist who undertakes the clarification and bringing to justice of the heinous murder of one student forty years later represents a dedicated effort to force a country from denial to reconciliation and closure of tragic social and political events in a country´s history. A nation cannot allow official cover-ups that seek to delete and erase from the collective memory events that prevent a nation´s march towards social justice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kAtGEXPyJJRvOachLb3AvSGauSt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77263,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magenta Films","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":119704,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sula Films","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2010-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borrar de la Memoria","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
