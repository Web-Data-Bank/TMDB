Manipulation and creating illusions is their profession. For them, the visual aspect of theater making is of great importance. These theater makers all have a special relationship with fine arts, they often use theater as a complement to express themselves. This form of theater has a great variety: from traditional to contemporary visual art events and everything in between. However, the starting point is always the same: bringing objects to life. By following theater makers with the camera - before, during and after the performance - we get to see things that otherwise we would never get to see: improvisations, dilemmas, the carpentry and construction. The film confronts the audience with the ingenuity of the performers and explores the genre through observation and dialogue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moving Objects","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
