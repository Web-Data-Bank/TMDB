Can we meet the needs of a growing population in the face of rising temperatures and lower rainfall in an already arid land? Can we find harmony amongst the competing interests of cities, agriculture, industry, recreation, wildlife, and indigenous communities with rights to the water? Sweeping through seven U.S. and two Mexican states, the Colorado River is a lifeline to expanding populations and booming urban centers that demand water for drinking, sanitation and energy generation. And with 70% of the rivers’ water supporting agriculture, the river already runs dry before it reaches its natural end at the Gulf of California. Unless action is taken, the river will continue its retreat – a potentially catastrophic scenario for the millions who depend on it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4MNy2N32WUHTxel3exgwrVDlv0r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exploring a New Water Ethic for the New West","title":"Watershed: Exploring a New Water Ethic for the New West","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
