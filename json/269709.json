In a never-ending stream of images, we recognize elements from the forest that he then reduces to an abstraction. The film came about as a classical composition in which the picture and the musical contribution of Jim Oâ€™Rourke link up seamlessly and lead the mood in turn. A sense of freedom is what predominates.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/wD9v45c7emZgBfugM9peWdMNJmw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elements of Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
