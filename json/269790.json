Things go awry however when a hideously glam rock band checks into Lau’s room, and gets a free show via his hook-up. Meanwhile, silly thief Donald Ng (Richard Ng) uses ninjitsu to fool the locals while a womanizing tour guide (Eric Tsang) gets stalked by not one, but two pretty women (Cherie Chung and Pat Ha). And Buddy Cheung (Jacky Cheung) is a lowly mechanic at the hotel who lusts after gorgeous executive Sunflower (Joey Wong). But his tomboy co-worker Boy George (Cecilia Yip) secretly pines for him.","popularity":1.065,"poster_path":"/rxVA3Qxj1U6zDSAbn2q7SGyQezn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Companion Films Co.
