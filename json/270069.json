While Pratap's brother-in-law is also a police officer, his son, Nishant, quite comically, wants to be a bandit, and much to Pratap's chagrin, wants to follow in the steps of Sholay's Gabbar Singh. Things get out of control after a bank is robbed, and the police launch a man-hunt for the robbers, whose leader they believe is none other than Nishant.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2005-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nalaik","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
