This was filmed in 1907 but released in 1908. It was made at the request of Teddy Roosevelt, who saw coyotes being caught in Oklahoma *by hand*, and folks back east didn't believe him. While this movie is called \"The Wolf Hunt\", it was actually coyotes being caught, not wolves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oklahoma Natural Mutoscene Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1908-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolf Hunt","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
