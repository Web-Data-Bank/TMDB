In a ceaseless stream of light, people, landscapes and objects lead us to mysterious regions. French filmmaker Patrick Bokanowski’s work is hard to classify - and all the richer for it.

Difficult to define and locate, its strangeness is quite unique.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2KFym7sBD1r6DQ8c2WC9dmRCjfx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kira B.M.
