His name was Lonnie Donegan and the song he sang was Rock Island Line.  Doneganâ€™s rough-and-ready style was at odds with the polished crooners who dominated the charts. He played the guitar in a way that sounded like anyone could do it. Rock Island Line sounded like nothing else on the radio and it inspired a generation of British youths to pick up guitars and begin a journey that would take them to the top of the American charts.","popularity":0.811,"poster_path":"/klrtz76SxigKZeMHWY66FcJGYPf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98253,"logo_path":null,"name":"1515 Productions Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock Island Line: The Song That Made Britain Rock","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
