The music is a tribute to the pioneering 1970s fusion collective Weather Report, originally with Wayne Shorter on sax, Zawinul on keys, and later Jaco Pastorius on bass (among other personnel). Zawinul and the WDR play \"Brown Street\" and \"Carnavalito.\" Arranger Vince Mendoza re-imagines this colorful, small-group music for Europe's longest-lived jazz orchestra.
