When Aurelio's mistress kills herself, he adopts their illegitimate daughter Masangeles despite the stern objections of his wife Aurora. Masangeles finds herself growing up in a home ruled by a corrupt and self-centered tyrant and his manic colleagues while Uruguay teeters on the brink of civil war as bands of revolutionaries battle government militias. When she turns fourteen, Masangeles discovers a secret passageway in their home that leads to sanctuary in a nearby church which also serves as a storehouse for guns and ill-gotten cash. Teenage Masangeles falls in love with Santiago, her stepbrother who has joined the rebels fighting against the state, and she persuades him to take her virginity.","popularity":0.682,"poster_path":"/s72ZfxvTxmwwN9GRo5CTmdcSmiW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":859,"logo_path":"/wK6ssskf1QaGp057lSYb6fa3Nwc.png","name":"Saga Film","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":160347,"logo_path":null,"name":"BFS Producciones","origin_country":"UY"},{"id":78507,"logo_path":"/lVtS5Z6MITcHXlKhgwbM3CNYtuu.png","name":"Peacock Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":131190,"logo_path":null,"name":"ladoizquierdo","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2008-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polvo nuestro que estas en los cielos","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
