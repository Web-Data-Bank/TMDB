The film begins in a cinema, where the last scenes of Zezowate Szczescie are being shown. Born unlucky, a victim of the errors and distortions of Stalinism, he is released in 1956. He meets a politically feverish woman, her influential parents, and finally becomes the father of her child. But bad luck, or perhaps an unlucky era, will not let him forget.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bEQJWITrPCyrld8OBfArXVq4t4A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespol Filmowy \"Perspektywa\"","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1989-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen Piszczyk","video":false,"vote_average":6.714,"vote_count":7}
