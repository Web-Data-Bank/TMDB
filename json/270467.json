The officers explain that she has committed a battery and thereby earned herself an inescapable arrest and overnight stay in jail because by law they have no discretion. This sets the stage for two hours of court proceedings before three different judges, each trying to apply the Florida domestic violence laws.","popularity":1.134,"poster_path":"/7TiUqKphdMNji4SePin2zkQnSJm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zipporah Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Domestic Violence 2","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6}
