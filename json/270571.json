Forced to band together because of a housing shortage, the film's heroines set up camp in a deserted structure, despite the tongue-cluckings of local busybodies and do-gooders. Complications ensue when a huge corporation announces plans to raze the building and erect a factory. Amazingly, the ladies are saved by the very company that wants to evict them.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/40pF1WI5zd7p2mu3jSNPKVlVsTR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Ariane","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmsonor","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1129,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinétel","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1131,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rizzoli Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1956-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Club of Women","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
