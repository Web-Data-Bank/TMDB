Brain Dead Heart Attack marked a decade of snowboard videos for Think Thank, which was always one of the goals when it started. The concept was that the Brain Dead side would feature the dudes who have been around awhile at least in Think Thank videos, some of whom were quite literally brain dead. Heart Attack side would be the launch pad precursor for the new faces who would go on to film for Think Thank Almanac. We were moving out of the brain and into the heart; the heart of a new era of Think Thank, a crew of friends snowboarding together and filming each other, much like how it started 10 years ago.","popularity":0.844,"poster_path":"/jdYTEHfpBxCxDYnC6SXpqbT2k9R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Think Thank","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brain Dead And Having A Heart Attack","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
