By systematically scrutinising the industry that capitalises on the love for man's best friend, Moullet has made an absurdist film that shows how the love of animals has become a kind of surrogate religion for many people. He takes us to canine beauticians and beauty contests, and explores the field from dried dog food to advanced super-duper pooper-scoopers. By showing in great detail all those gadgets and gimmicks to make the lives of pets as agreeable as possible, Moullet vents his barely concealed criticism of consumer society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Empire de Médor","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
