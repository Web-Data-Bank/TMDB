Some villagers are stacking a bed of stone blocks on the river-bank to avoid more eroding. Others are occupied by ploughing, fishing or repairing. A small steamboat passes by. In the engine room a stoker is shovelling coal into the oven. Further down the river a small town is passed by the water. A rowing-team is training for coming races. Some biologists are looking at microbes from the water through a microscope. A group of workers are painting a new barge and push it into the river. When a small boy sees a racing boat, he leaves his sand-castle and runs along the river.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ygzWdcxf06T6ktGdzCwjvjKNkj6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Budapest Filmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tisza: Autumn Sketches","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
