Clear about what is not appropriate for her, she is searching for what is: a choice. She takes a job at an inner-city hair salon and a room in a nearby boarding house. Here she meets Gaye, who lives on love and spurts on her asthma inhaler. Through a quirk of fate she meets Rex in the hall with not much on but the imprint of a boot on his behind. She takes him in, captivated by his smile. They warm to one another at once. Rex appreciates Mitchell's style and is impossible to ignore. The drawback is he comes fully loaded: Mitchell discovers that where Rex is trouble follows close behind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1z5Q2U1qibHMgHJnK0x7DCd5SUe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tender Hooks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
