It reveals Singapore's past and present with a delight and humour that makes it a necessary film for all Singaporeans. We hear buskers, street vendors, school cheerleaders sing hymns to themselves and to their communities. From these vocabularies (including Arabic, Latin, Hainanese), a sense of what it might mean to be a modern Singaporean emerges. This is Singapore's first documentary to have a cinema release. With English and Chinese subtitles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6YCA4pGqyjNeTVaLjAQODp6ZmFd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2005-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Singapore GaGa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
