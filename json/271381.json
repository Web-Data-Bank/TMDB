A \"Bray\" Studios Production. Bobby tries to sneak his dog into the theatre. He gets past the woman at the kiosk but the commissionaire spots the dog in a mirror. The pooch licks tears from his master's eyes as they sit on the pavement outside. An aristocratic lady arrives at the theatre in a chauffeur driven car and the dog gets underneath the train of her dress and into the auditorium. Bobby follows after him. They watch a film where a hypnotist commands his victim to \"Bark like a dog\". Bobby tries to hypnotise his pet and tells him to \"Bark like a dog\". He does so and they are thrown out of the theatre. They are kicked so hard that they fly through the window of a tram. Bobby then hypnotises the conductor into believing that they had paid their fare and indeed that the conductor owes them change. The conductor gives them some money. Bobby has a good laugh about their scams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eLW3SJoXvOK9xYLyO4pviHGBDGC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobby Bumps and the Hypnotic Eye","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
