John Syrup Soother wins the marriage to who he believes is the heiress, Olive Palmer, a tank of a woman who has lost her beauty with age. But he learns that he his betrothed is not the heiress, Diana Palmer, but her mother. Howson Lotts, a shyster and one of Diana's other suitors, sells John a beach-front house for his new life, that house which is not all that it seems on the surface. In the meantime, others still will do anything to be Diana's betrothed, that choice in which John now has a different but still vested interest.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":"/6MAyrBgmG0DXvnQ4UHN4U8yuA9K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mack Sennett Comedies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Galloping Bungalows","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
