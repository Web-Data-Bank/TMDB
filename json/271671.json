Maybe once, some time ago, he was loved. Maybe, some time, he had loved ones waiting for him, missing him. Today he is only a shadow, lost amongst all the shadows of the days that begin and no one sees. He is a shadow that wakes up in the sidewalk and rummages the trashcans, searching for plastic bottles or cans to sell for a few coins that will give him to eat for the day. It’s the fight to survive one more day, every day, one more day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2013-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the eyes of a homeless man","title":"Galus Galus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
