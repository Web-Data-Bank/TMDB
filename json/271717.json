As a teenager, her passion for iconography almost inspires her to join a convent, but in the end she decides to devote her talents to the Femen movement. With Anna, Inna and Sasha, she founds the famous feminist group which protests against the regime and which will see her leave her homeland, Ukraine, and travel all over Europe. Driven by a creative zeal and a desire to change the world, Oxana allows us a glimpse into her world and her personality, which is as unassuming, mesmerising and vibrant as her passionate artworks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uBlsOAY2JNWRYbZXiycwsVtCAGo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caravel Production","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":19932,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmcoopi Zürich","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2014-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am FEMEN","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
