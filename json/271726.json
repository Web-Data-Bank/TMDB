Using the words of their ancestors passed on by oral folklore, the villagers trace the history of their village and their difficulties in working their land and living off their produce. Fad'jal is an extraordinary boundary defying film that interweaves ethnographic footage, intimate observation of everyday village life and fictionalised historical scenes. With it, Faye carefully encourages the viewers to reflect both on African history and storytelling, and on the intersection of fiction and documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/56DErD8o0rTxKfabWPHfvhbn8A8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"1979-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fad'jal","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
