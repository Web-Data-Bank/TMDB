Bedirxan, an elementary school teacher in Homs, had contacted Mohammed online to ask him what he would film, if he was there. Mohammed, working in forced exile in Paris, is tormented by feelings of cowardice as he witnesses the horrors from afar, and the self-reflexive film also chronicles how he is haunted in his dreams by a Syrian boy once shot to death for snatching his camera on the street.","popularity":0.992,"poster_path":"/rmx5XsOQvozFDOcnww5R6FVoHM6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Proaction Film","origin_country":""},{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'ici","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silvered Water","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":10}
