His deft comic style merged easily with his strength as a romantic leading man. But the suave exterior concealed a complex and often sensitive individual. Cary's painful journey from his lonely working-class beginnings to the peak of Hollywood royalty is made vivid through family photos, archival footage, clips from many of his films -- including his first starring role in SHE DONE HIM WRONG, following his discovery by blonde bombshell Mae West. Among friends and colleagues interviewed on-screen are Leslie Caron, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Deborah Kerr, Eva Marie Saint, Ralph Bellamy, Stanley Donen, Richard Brooks and Stanley Kramer. Narrated by Richard Kiley. -  Ralph Bellamy, Richard Brooks, Michael Caine","popularity":0.68,"poster_path":"/ahm5M5cyBCCc4IMjdCauH1ipkzK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cary Grant: A Celebration of a Leading Man","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
