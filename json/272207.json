She left for New York City and worked hard as a model, stage actor and TV player. And then she was discovered by Hollywood. In less than four years she was acknowledged as one of movie's most sought after stars and an Academy-Award winner, playing opposite some of the greatest leading men of her time. Suddenly, like a modern-day fairy tale, Grace Kelly turned her back on it all - to become Her Serene Highness Princess Grace of Monaco.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1uhmOjBrVROhepgbUqTG9yVkfHO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14501,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeVillier Donegan Enterprizes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grace Kelly: The American Princess","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
