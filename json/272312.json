Marv, the owner of an old neighborhood Jewish deli, must stay open 24 hours to cater to a new generation of client√®le, but straight-laced neighborhood do-gooders want to close him down. Meanwhile inside, hippies, bikers and crusty old Jewish men, caught in the throes of changing times and culture clash, fight over turf and yearn for a waitress to take their orders. Into this milieu drops new waitress, Susan, a wholesome small town beauty who must struggle with testy customers, a dubious romance, and a jealous head-waitress. Her future and the fate of the regulars hang by a thread as Marv takes increasingly desperate measures to save his deli.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eqauH76KLp18G1FhEFA89Px6FzG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nightowls of Coventry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
