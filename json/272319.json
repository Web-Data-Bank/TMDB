Matthew Kang, a young management consultant (Yoon) is struck by a car and sustains a serious concussion. Terminated by his employer and dumped by his vaguely leftist bohemian girlfriend, Matthew derives a wicked sense of humor from the weirdness of his own situation, and in the process slowly rediscovers himself and life's deeper meanings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Post Concussion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
