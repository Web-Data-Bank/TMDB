What has kept his playing fresh is his refusal to be chained by these digital devices. As he told Down Beat writer Bill Milkowski, \"I try to adjust my playing to the timbre and learn something about how to play that sound, yet at the same time I have to try and force the instrument to play with me a little bit. In other words, I sometimes try to overplay the instrument.\" SOLOS: THE JAZZ SESSIONS spotlights unaccompanied performances by some of the legends and bright young stars of the jazz world. Designed and recorded specifically for television, SOLOS offers viewers front row seats for an intimate and unique jazz experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z6nIgieJAtagjem2EuGF2tnv1DJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Abercrombie: Solos - The Jazz Sessions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
