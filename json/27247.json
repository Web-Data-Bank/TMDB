One of the finest songwriters of the 20th century is well showcased on this DVD. The Red Piano's set list features some of Sir Elton John's best-known crowd pleasers and he delivers each performance with gusto. One can't help but get enraptured by his enthusiasm, and I found myself tapping my toes to a few tunes that I wouldn't even count among my favorites, ie: Benny and the Jets. There's something about seeing the songss performed live that makes them that much more engaging. Vocally, Elton is in excellent form, and though he modifies a few melodies (he doesn't hit the high notes like he used to - he leaves that to his back-up vocalists), his voice sounds rich and full.","popularity":1.248,"poster_path":"/96sbYZ1bG5LAcgEB5kH49Eo7u6i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elton John: The Red Piano","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":4}
