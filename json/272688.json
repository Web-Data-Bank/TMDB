It's a week full of high-altitude rides, evenings relaxing with friends and testing their skills against other extreme athletes, such as Fred Fugen and Vincent Reffet, also both speed-riders, and Thibaud Duchosal, a professional off-piste skier. Thibaud never uses a parachute so Jérôme and François decide to design a system to take him up in the air with them and release him over previously inaccessible slopes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t4FtsBIqmXbiJ2dYTnLU29HqYOV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over the Edge: Ultimate Speed Riders","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
