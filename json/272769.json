Carole LeBlanc and Jo BÃ©fort, an engaging lesbian couple, have done just that. Carole and Jo started their wine adventure six years ago in Collias, France. Their dream was to produce excellent wine. They had no experience, just their passion - and friends. Winemaking is a complex and labor intensive process, and still a very macho affair in France. But as this captivating film reveals, it is possible for two women who are willing to work hard to achieve their dream and live the life they choose - as well as bring an entire village and community into their world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wine, Women & Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
