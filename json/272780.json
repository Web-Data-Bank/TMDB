The author's reassurance and guidance concerning the process of writing—which has little resemblance to its glorified image—becomes a stirring call to action celebrating the potential of each individual, the silencing of our inner critics, and the courage to create something honest and meaningful. Poignant and inspirational, ‘Bird by Bird with Annie’ takes us deep into Anne Lamott's intoxicatingly brave world, one in which writing is a means of finding out who we are, how we live, and why we're here.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9YT0A2dMrEdZDO2re4R5jdlwEPy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bird by Bird with Annie: A Film Portrait of Writer Anne Lamott","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
