This blunt glimpse into their quarters, animistic rituals, and daily (and nightly) lives has all the appearance of a well-shot documentary but is in fact a scripted film with convincing special effects, based on a novella of the same title by the gifted and controversial Soviet Kirghiz writer, Chingiz Aitmatov. \"Dog running at the edge of the sea\" is what the Nyvkhs call the forbidding place they have domesticated as their home, husbanding and speaking of it by means of myths and \"poetry of the concrete\" with which they commemorate their savage lives. --Ronald Levaco","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qBxpdSB3l8YDUth6dJ6W0sxh3fp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4581,"logo_path":"/p858ADU9O67a7ageVEjsk18jqak.png","name":"Dovzhenko Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spotted Dog Running at the Edge of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
