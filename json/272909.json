Using early footage of \"the best live band on the planet,\" interviews with band members and the audience, and the riotous performance itself, Black 47 at Connolly's weaves together a history of the band's beginnings, and by extension, a rich underlay of Irish-American history and the Diaspora.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pB51tbAR96QHJtqO9bdsTIPs8X7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black 47 at Connolly's: New Year's Eve in Times Square","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
