A retro act before the term was even coined, John Cohen's band looked backwards for inspiration, and found much to love in the distinctly old fashioned sound of old- time string bands. The unclassifiable Greenbriar Boys also put in a good showing, weaving their inimitable magic that encompasses elements of country, blues, and bluegrass styles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rainbow Quest: New Lost City Ramblers and Green Briar Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
