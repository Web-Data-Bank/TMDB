When the Duke learns of the Princess's plight, he risks his life to help her and learns that true love means thinking of others first.

Plus, Laura the Carrot stars in Baby Sitter In DeNile - a charming retelling of the story of Miriam and Moses.","popularity":1.352,"poster_path":"/88IbAKTE8tvJN7C4ExdxrUDx5JC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Idea Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":56670,"logo_path":null,"name":"DKP Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VeggieTales: Duke and the Great Pie War","video":true,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5}
