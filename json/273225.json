Although little known, the film is representative of both Hill’s do-it yourself approach – employing character cutouts, strong, yet playful colors, and a narrative and technical simplicity rich with charm – and her jovial demeanor and inquisitive approach to life. The film is dedicated to Elijah Aron, Hill’s boyfriend throughout college. Aron remained close friends with Helen and her husband Paul Gailiunas, and was the godfather of their son Francis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
