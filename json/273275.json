Sam is enticed from his home by hearing the sound of mouth harps played by two of his friends; out of the window he comes. He then gets a job to carry a trunk, an organ-grinder starts his feet a-going; he gets a job as waiter, the orchestra does the balance. Then he becomes a porter, the Dutch band finishes him with this position; then a barber, an artist's model and other positions, from all of which he is promptly fired because he can't keep his feet still when the strains of music float in the air.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1907-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dancing Nig","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
