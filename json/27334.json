The ugly, blasphemous and obscene work stresses out the often anarchic side of the animation film and is easily incorporated into the complete works of the artists collective Le Dernier Cri, which was founded in 1993 in Marseille.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u2oCdZMFK168CWHkJVGthUTSGKh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Savage Religions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
