Her life story also portrays an era in our American cultural heritage that has largely been underserved in the documentary film genre. Texas-born Olga Samaroff a.k.a. Lucy Hickenlooper lived at a time when music was dominated by men and Old World prejudices----and she emerged as a leader among many. Against tremendous odds she rose from complete obscurity to be the most successful American woman concert pianist of the early 20th Century. -  Lorri Holt, Frederica von Stade","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s8Jk27Ao80INEzBV2UunISbrtKj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virtuoso: The Olga Samaroff Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
