Fifty years later, after the collapse of the Communist bloc, this newsreel was lost in the confusion of the fighting in Yugoslavia. In Journal No. 1 Hito Steyerl attempts to find out how the footage got lost and what was on this document from the Sutjeska studio. In the simultaneous projection of Journal No. 1 the ‘unattainability of an historical zero hour of the national identity’ takes concrete form: The lost newsreel reports on a literacy campaign as well as Muslim women confidently removing their headscarves. We listen however to eyewitnesses trying to recapture the lost content and we see the artist Arman Kulasic making a number of drawings that resemble the story-boards for the lost film. What appears to be moments of great change remain limited by subjective and uncertain memory.  The film was premiered at documenta 12.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lMs4uVivvcmvICiJOkFC11DGtyZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journal No. 1 - An Artist's Impression","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
