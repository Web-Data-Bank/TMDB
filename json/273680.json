Now, in this live concert film, he gives fans the opportunity to witness the high-energy, state-of-the-art show first-hand. The 18-song set list showcases 10 of his No. one songs including; She's Country; Big Green Tractor; My Kinda Party; Take A Little Ride, and offers a rare glimpse behind the scenes from the time he and his team begin the planning stages of this show right up to the moment he takes the stage. Also featured in the 90-minute film are personal interviews from Aldean, footage from his record-breaking Fenway Park and Wrigley Field stadium shows held in the Summer of 2013, as well as appearances by Kelly Clarkson, Luke Bryan, and Ludacris as each of them join Aldean on songs they've recorded together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1O37tltLABcNO3xkJOATBkcAUeO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jason Aldean: Night Train to Georgia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
