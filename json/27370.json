Police were called to the scene by Thomas himself in the early hours of the morning, finding him inside with his sister's body cradled in his arms. In his statement given in police custody, Thomas claimed that the victims were attacked by a demonic entity of unknown origin. Days later, he committed suicide. It is the opinion of those closely related to the family that a video found at the scene be shown to the public as a final testament to what actually happened inside the Finley home in those final days.","popularity":6.054,"poster_path":"/w5NFNKiUl2AtXuNY6JVhY7opG2M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1311,"logo_path":"/ic2bTizdzRLDVzAvN7MXdUg3WQV.png","name":"The Asylum","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Decide the truth for yourself.","title":"Paranormal Entity","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":99}
