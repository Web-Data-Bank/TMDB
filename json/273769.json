In the tradition of Ross McElwee, Mills created an autobiographical film in which she meditates on a universal human theme with a camera strapped to her bike. It is a contemplative response to \"An Inconvenient Truth\" and provides a unique perspective on one person's attempt to reduce her carbon footprint and overcome fear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Mr. Gore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
