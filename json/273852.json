Their montage sifts through these “images of a deadly gaze” for the reality they conspicuously elide, for the resistance that has retreated “behind the mask”. The soundtrack blends together poetry, recitations, and experimental music into a polyphonic swan song to colonial violence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xfVaDXF0MJESHGKCfjibqneTdNW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1640,"logo_path":null,"name":"O.N.C.I.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1983-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zerda and the Songs of Forgetting","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":3}
