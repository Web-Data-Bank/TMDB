The fan backlash against the 1985-6 hiatus for the series and the finding of some previously lost Jon Pertwee era episodes are addressed, and this documentary closes with some on-the-street interviews with British viewers, who tell who their favorite Doctor is.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/d6jfiuH2KCAa3MNwSFuABgs4dmx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13456,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Jersey Network (NJN)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who's Who","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
