De Nederlandse Opera has chosen to use the more flexible French libretto of the 1921 premiere, a pertinent choice which has the advantage of accentuating the aesthetic common ground shared by Prokofiev and Les Six. Stephane Deneve's brilliant musical direction inspires outstanding performances from the soloists and the superb Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, enhanced by the smart, blockbusting staging of Laurent Pelly and the exquisite sets of Chantal Thomas, which propel this feverish fable to great heights.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/olRlTAHaK27RKvkauRGJn4qIBId.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Love for Three Oranges","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
