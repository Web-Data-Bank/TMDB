Gaines, author of \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\" comes a deceptively simple, yet emotionally complex tale of a young boy's discovery of what it's like to be black in Louisiana during the 1940's. James, the boy in question, has a raging toothache that necessitates a trip to the dentist. His mother (played by Emmy-winner Olivia Cole), accompanies James to town on an eye-opening odyssey where the boy gains valuable insights into poverty, racism - and his own sense of pride. With an exciting musical score by Webster Lewis, this multi-award winning film explores a child's discovery that the world is a complicated place... where things are never truly black or white... only shades of gray. -  Olivia Cole, James Bond III, Margaret Avery","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wM9AuRNXvLLxt7uUOHJ8AlEx6fj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sky Is Gray","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
