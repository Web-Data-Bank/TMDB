The name speaks for itself:  2FAST? - 205 mph on a bike and a 150mph wheelie is way too fast for the street!  2REAL? - It's incredible what takes place on public streets: cops, tickets and more.  FOR HOLLYWOOD? No actor or film director could capture the raw drama and thrilling reality of street racing.  The film is packed with gut-wrenchingly fast racing including a burnout in Time Square! There are also police busts galore and lots and lots of delicious American honeyz to drool over!  It's fast, scary and very illegal - you have been warned!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uLVDxWEfhGgjuiKglHTL4jtQpZo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A street racing documentary","title":"2 Fast 2 Real for Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
