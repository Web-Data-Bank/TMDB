The film depicts a chaotic period through the relationship of the two brothers, one dedicated to his family and conscience; the other dedicated to a political ideal. These divided brothers can be read as a representation of a country torn in two, of a history rudely divided. Lithuania has a history of occupation and the struggle to survive is as much personal as it is cultural.","popularity":1.021,"poster_path":"/aKqgxdU1pGg1vFgBOZm4YtW7Haz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2064,"logo_path":"/4cxlmKotK2vAm0TKcGrSGyhxD07.png","name":"Lithuanian Film Studio","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1968-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feelings","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6}
