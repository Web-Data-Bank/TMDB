Scripting the landscape and exploring the residue of a cinematic history, The Broken Altar forms a sculptural treatment of the architectural artifacts of these abandoned and barren spaces: speaker boxes rise from tall grass like grave markers and the screens themselves are monumental, sepulchral in their peeling whiteness.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":"/e5k9ALLQkBwtf8Jkbs2x5FkkvZA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Broken Altar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
