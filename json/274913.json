The world they occupy is not a world of large events but the rituals of everyday life, traditions and interdependence. “In Spring One Plants Alone” documents the minutiae of their very enclosed existence. Filmed over a period of one and a half years, it emerges as a rare, haunting and powerful portrayal of their life together. This is the story of their rituals and of their survival. The small and disconnected instances that we encounter form a lone vision of the rifts and the bond between an old woman and her disturbed son.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/haW4ZcgwkSY7l6zn6PC75bapYFO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vincent Ward Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1980-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Spring One Plants Alone","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
