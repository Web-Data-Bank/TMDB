Ross Bennett is a stand-up comic for people who say they don't like Stand-up comics. Bright, insightful and classically funny. Ross's point of view is what he calls â€˜NEW YORK COUNTRY'. He's a guy who grew up in a small town in western New York State, with traditional American values and sensibilities. But his years of living in \"The Big City\" have made his act accessible to everyone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/KTlNM0ll1j40YDasFYg96EWNyr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ross Bennett: Live in Toomler, Amsterdam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
