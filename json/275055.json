He is unimpressed by their modest but hardly primitive country home, disgusted and disheartened by their unpalatable fare. So begins \"Guttaperc,\" a film by Barbados-born producer/director Andrew Millington. But the Caribbean world Eric finds himself in is not as simple as he thought. Indeed, it is one caught in a struggle, represented by the two figures that dominate his life: his grandfather (played by Clairmonte Taitt), a local supplier of construction materials, and Sister Pam (Leonie Forbes), an elderly woman with her feet and gnarled cane firmly planted in the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shango Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"BB","name":"Barbados"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guttaperc","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
