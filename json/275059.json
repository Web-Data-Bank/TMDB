This film will help others learn what is at stake and what can be done to protect the source of nearly all our food: SEEDS. While the price of gold and oil skyrockets the fate of our most priceless commodity is ignored. Seeds provide the basis for everything from fabric, to food to fuels. They are as essential to life as the air we breathe or water we drink... but given far less attention. Over the past one hundred years, seeds have steadily shifted from being common heritage to sovereign property. This film tells the story of seeds by following the challenges and triumphs of some of their most tireless stewards and advocates.","popularity":1.142,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Pollinated Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Open Sesame: The Story of Seeds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
