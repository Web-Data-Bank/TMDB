In the process, she captures the frustration, tedium and petty annoyances of a revolving-door relationship with the medical establishment, while portraying the complicated web of emotions that accompany any medical problem. With humor and honesty, The Odds of Recovery uses the filmmaker's medical history as a means to address a perennial human problem: the desire to avoid conflict and deny the need for radical change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/49TXxJi11DNfjFfJjsL77RxcyRx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Odds of Recovery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
