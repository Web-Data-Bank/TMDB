Creating physical experience that transcends the autonomous object and cinematic medium, filmmaker Mika Rottenberg guides us through elaborately constructed physical and metaphysical environments. All activities converge in a Harlem bingo hall where a sequence of numbers opens mechanic portals into an alternate reality. Here, the relationship of cause and effect obeys bizarre laws and characters linked by invisible forces engage in a parapsychological chain of events. These actions move planets, influence global temperature, and shift architecture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bowls Balls Souls Holes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
