At the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, you start small: A briefcase, a Blackberry, a victim's sweatshirt, and a hero's nametag. Simple objects that tell personal stories, recounted in the donors' own words. Stories from New York, the Pentagon and Shanksville, PA remind us that the legacy of 9/11 is not fear -- it's friendship, courage, and ordinary people pushed by extraordinary circumstances.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/rLDQ7seF2DMKckqa4DwLTbKfffC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9/11: Stories in Fragments","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
