Refusing to confine the tears, rage, laughter and hope to dinner table conversations, Helfand invites us to witness her personal journey from radical hysterectomy patient to vocal opponent of toxic exposure. From her suburban home to the halls of Congress, the intensely private becomes widely public, and an American family is transformed and strengthened.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/23IaZ0fbvuawZOnDfz5defdN0x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"},{"id":24488,"logo_path":"/qR7gDm9nMYdrqnVpksmNMhwI1ZI.png","name":"Women Make Movies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Healthy Baby Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
