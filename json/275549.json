Yet few know about the National AIDS Memorial Grove, a seven-acre sanctuary hidden in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park and a testament to lives lost at a time when the stigma of AIDS forced many to grieve in silence. THE GROVE shows how a community in crisis found healing and remembrance, and how the seeds of a few visionary environmentalists blossomed into something larger than they could have imagined.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6uMGssbinCPGDc44M7T6kGdgBBk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grove","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
