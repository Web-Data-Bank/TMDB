The sacrifice made by residents of the area was immense as those directly impacted by the project were forced to relocate to new homes or, in the case of \"house moving\", a new address. For many, historic connections to their roots were lost forever as 22,000 acres of land were flooded to become part of Lake St. Lawrence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A River Lost: The Story of the St. Lawrence Seaway","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
