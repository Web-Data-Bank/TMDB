The film focuses on the feelings of the two new residents in their encounters with other residents, medical staff, social workers, psychiatrists and family. A touching, sometimes painfully honest dramatic experience, it is valuable for in-service staff training, and for all other audiences both professional and non professional, interested in the problems of the aged.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home for Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
