A stellar student, she resisted the pressure to go to college as her sights were firmly set on Broadway. She was determined to become an actress and landed her first role aged 16, but it was two years later, when she started to sing, that her career took off.  Subverting stereotypes and breaking glass ceilings, this programme looks at her rise to stardom and the remarkable achievements of her early career.","popularity":0.817,"poster_path":"/bArqnFqlzJPMJqNvcRuLkLTjd2e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48098,"logo_path":"/fWIaTm5r2j6WHgatBFLn1ioZxSB.png","name":"Roche Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barbra Streisand: Becoming an Icon 1942–1984","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6}
