It was carried out by visionary 1960s neuroscientist John Lilly, who had a remarkable ambition; to communicate with dolphins by teaching them to speak English. The experiment was seized upon by NASA, who were embarking on the first serious search for extra-terrestrial intelligence beyond the Earth. When they detected a signal from ET, they would need to understand how to communicate with a species other than humans. Here, without leaving the planet, was the opportunity to practice such inter-species communication. But what started with â€˜60s idealism would spiral into the darkness of the decade, and end in tragedy, with rumours and scandal about drug abuse and a sexual relationship between Peter and Margaret. Fifty years on, this film tells the real story of just what happened at the Dolphin House.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/u4H1KpzIPCGBydFfMMy4CprHVSn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl Who Talked to Dolphins","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2}
