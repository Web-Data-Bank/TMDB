Daunant was haunted by these creatures. His obsession was first visualized when he wrote the autobiographical script for Albert Lamorisse’s award-winning 1953 film White Mane. In this short the beauty of the horses is captured with a variety of film techniques and by Jacques Lasry’s beautiful electronic score.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":174287,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sinpri","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1960-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream of the Wild Horses","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
