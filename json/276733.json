For the first time, a documentary captures stunning footage in the midst of this demanding journey.  The documentary starts at the beginning of the year, when more than two million animals gather in the shadow of the volcanoes on the southern edge of the Serengeti in order to birth their offspring. In just two weeks, the animal herd's population has increased by one third, and after only two days, the calves can already run as fast as the adults The young wildebeest in this phase of their life are the most vulnerable to attacks by lions, cheetahs, leopards or hyenas. The film then follows the survivors of these attacks through the next three months on their incredible journey, a trip so long that 200,000 wildebeest will not reach the end.","popularity":0.881,"poster_path":"/fTClhSLfWtxNSxNMWnCo4VPAe4F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24043,"logo_path":null,"name":"KSM GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wildebeest Migration: Nature's Greatest Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
