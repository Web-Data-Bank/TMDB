In this world, a young man living in a decaying wreck of a dwelling struggles to come to terms with his bleak existence while trying to save his mother from the grip of a strange black fluid which seems to prolong life but at the same time leaves it's users in a drug-like haze and causes scar-like tissue to cover their bodies. Scars of Youth follows in the tradition of classic European science fiction such as Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker and Solaris, while at the same time forging new ground in surrealistic fantasy film.","popularity":0.652,"poster_path":"/bT6gngSX5HHWz18ObEJWzjz13VT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where life is eternal, the only monuments left are the scars of youth.","title":"Scars of Youth","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2}
