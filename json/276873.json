Oh dear no. They actually have to use their lorries to do something useful.  They have to build a real, use able bridge over the River Kwai. On their way to the river they almost bring down Burma’s power supply, encounter the world’s least relaxing truck stop, race around the streets of a deserted capital, saddle up a trio of unhelpful horses and attend a completely deranged party.","popularity":2.248,"poster_path":"/gx7255MKl8nfIDCeOCFU5QBkYuP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Bridge Over The River Kok","title":"Top Gear: The Burma Special","video":true,"vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":15}
