A million people gathered on the Plaza de Mayo to acclaim the new President.  One of Cámpora's first presidential actions was a granting of amnesty to political prisoners who where jailed during the dictatorship.  On 28 May Argentina restored diplomatic relations with Cuba, which then received Argentine aid - such as food and industrial products - to break the United States embargo against Cuba.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1973-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Tango","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
