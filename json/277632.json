The islands all have different climates and cultures, but the people all love their native lands. The film, which took three years to shoot, focuses on their daily lives. It portrays festivals that foster ties among the people, traditional crafts which have been passed on for generations, and peaceful lives by the water. They are all disappearing by climate change. When these people lose their homelands, their cultures and histories face death. Their lives in the midst of all the changes suggest where our future leads.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jpqvlQP3t9tnLfLjQIOqdaP6rcI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Horizon Features","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2010-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beautiful Islands","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
