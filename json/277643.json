Most of the interviews come from the post-Beatles era: Pete Best (and Fred Seaman ) speaks of the savage days in Hamburg .There is a lot of unseen photographs although they are sometimes anachronistic : for instance,they are talking about the campaign for peace while showing pictures of Lennon with his second son Sean.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8VvtqnGNZCSAMqkNkPbaFkawMU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beatles: A Celebration","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
