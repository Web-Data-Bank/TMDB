After his brush with fame, it only took a few years of drugs and alcohol to reach rock bottom. After yet another small town concert, Punk ends up spending the night backstage, drunk and alone. When he opens his eyes in the morning, he sees a little girl, who introduces herself as his daughter. Two lost souls set out on a trip together – a trip which will not only change their lives, but will also bring them together to appreciate the joy it brings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ul8IsP5un6N28LwTRVSEFC0Frhd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Litl Baz Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2014-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When You Wake Up","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2}
