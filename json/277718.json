Following a long period of social unrest over bank failures, property speculation and government mismanagement, crowds gather to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Council building. Panic ensues as a bomb is reported inside the LegCo building, planted by someone calling himself \"Skywalker\". Meanwhile, a branch of Hong Kong &amp; China Banking Corporation is held up by two young people in masks - chemistry student Lang (Kelvin Kwan) and social drop-out Fish (Fish Liew). Among the people in the bank are disillusioned former teacher Yue Chung-tak (Teddy Robin), councilman Ho Chung-lai (K.K. Cheung), his mistress Rebecca (Maggie Chan), the bank's investment saleswoman Luk Wan-yee (Kay Tse), her philandering boyfriend Victor Lo (Wilfred Lau), and Wan-yee's onetime boyfriend, police detective Kin-ho (Paul Wong). All have their own reasons for being in the bank that day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wCXuhnEB6P8S5tUvuBBAOxwT3Td.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2013-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doomsday Party","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
