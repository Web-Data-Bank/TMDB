For as long as he could remember, twelve year old Tom Canty had dreamed of being a Prince. Whenever he was not begging for money for his cruel father, Tom played \"being Prince\" with his friends. Tom Canty and Prince Edward, the soon to be king, bear a striking resemblance to one another and decide to swap places. Unfortunately, the once innocent trick turns into a nightmare, and the Pauper and the Prince become desperate in their struggle to prove their real identity before it is too late and the Pauper is crowned King.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wjWiq2NdaOyda7rIHK6bPO0CTLy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blye Migicovsky Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":69643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phoenix Animation Studios","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":69645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jaffa Road Management Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prince and the Pauper","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
