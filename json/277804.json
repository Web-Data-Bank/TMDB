Dana Delany, Keith Carradine, and Brian Dennehy star in this moving, suspenseful drama about one woman's courageous battle to bring a rogue cop to justice.  Sally Rawlings (Delany), a corporate executive with a bright future, watches her life spin out of control after a policeman, Officer Wexler (Carradine), cold-bloodedly kills her ex-husband before her very eyes. Wexler is acquitted of any wrongdoing, and Sally finds herself standing alone against a shocking police department cover-up. Thwarted at every turn by a system steeped in deceit and corruption, Sally takes the law into her own hands. Hacking into computer files, staking out Wexler and questioning witnesses, Sally will risk everything – including her own life – to expose the truth.","popularity":0.81,"poster_path":"/xCKn02u5tuY91dW02UiVu1uXIXq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9223,"logo_path":"/of4mmVt6egYaO9oERJbuUxMOTkj.png","name":"Paramount Television Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4343,"logo_path":"/rXq1B1Hnkdnw6soz1zoGcslK3wb.png","name":"Showtime Networks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A bad cop.
