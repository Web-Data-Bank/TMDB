This film features Terry 'Coyote' Murphy representing the Native American influence of the isle of Manhattan. Coyote, a Shaman Trail Scout, takes a journey which transcends time, weaving from Inwood Park (where the island was traded for beads &amp; booze), down a long native path (now called 'the great white way', more commonly known as 'Broadway'), to the lower reaches of Manhattan into 'ground zero' (which is now a sacred burial ground for not just the American Indian &amp; the slaves of yesteryear, but for the newest natives of this island empire as well).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A journey which transcends time","title":"Native New Yorker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
