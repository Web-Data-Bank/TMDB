The plot unravels while keeping the viewer on tenterhooks and the film moves at a steady pace.  How do a Godman and his psychic abilities influence the investigation? Are the murders related to tormented childhoods of psychopaths and the twisted world of mental illness? How many die before the criminal is brought to justice, and what is the real crime? Watch on.","popularity":1.032,"poster_path":"/q5Wkh0zjNey8EXh6i2uyktNuntJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gandhimathi Release","origin_country":""},{"id":39709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gandhimathi Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1990-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ee Thanutha Veluppan Kalathu","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
