Described as a tale of local hoods ‘stealing the hearts and souls of their own’, it follows a group of local chancers who decide to, one way or another, cash in on the Olympic Games.  2K, a DJ from the area, returns from a kind of exile to reconcile with his father, only to find himself drawn into a world of criminality, deception and violence in the shadow of the Olympic development.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ripping the heart out of East London","title":"Hot Wings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
