He wavers between yesterday, the German occupation nightmare and his love debut with a neighbour and contemporary, fluid reality. He meets Thaleia, a rich woman his age, who frequents the same night club as him, but his daily routine is invariably the same. The closure of the small industry in Drapetsona, where he used to work for the last 8 years, and his relationship with Maria confront him with a different reality. Maria is a progressive, evening school teacher, full of dreams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bMR1GowXHArVAM9dyRtHAWe2aYF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Alfa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1967-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Open Letter","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":4}
