Mikels","overview":"THE WILD WORLD OF TED V. MIKELS, a new documentary by Kevin Sean Michaels (no blood relation to Ted, but the same spirit), is a rollicking look at the independent cinema and film pioneering of Ted V. Mikels, who has been producing films for over 60 years. Way before limited-budget action films became termed as \"grindhouse,\" Ted was wowing audiences with his own special brand of guts, gore, humor, violence and most of all -- style. THE CORPSE GRINDERS 1 + 2, THE ASTRO-ZOMBIES, 10 VIOLENT WOMEN, MISSION: KILLFAST, THE BLACK KLANSMAN, THE DOLL SQUAD, THE WORM EATERS and GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS are some of Ted's films that have made their cinematic mark.","popularity":1.636,"poster_path":"/cZ2410PxoJjB4JPngl8xQ1t3yAT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wild World of Ted V.
