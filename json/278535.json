To mark the event Gabriel reunited his original “So” touring band from 1986/87 – Tony Levin, David Rhodes, David Sancious and Manu Katché - and for the very first time fans saw them play the multi-platinum selling album in its entirety. But the concert is much more than just a nostalgic trip down memory lane; delivering performances of new and even unfinished material alongside acoustic re-workings and a plentiful supply of classic favourites, broken down into three sections. What Peter calls “the starter, the savoury course and the dessert”.","popularity":2.087,"poster_path":"/lazTGPxiGDW81TnoC6TUl7o1CIz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214,"logo_path":"/qIptM4dZBNflgv2OXzYECv8iQNH.png","name":"Eagle Vision","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":4460,"logo_path":"/lSMFq3pS8HGlBoSLL3edvRijWME.png","name":"Done+Dusted","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Gabriel: Back To Front","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":10}
