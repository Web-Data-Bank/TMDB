During the next twelve months he would document his unique experiences as he and his platoon were tasked with the politically charged mission of searching for the infamous weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). The search would take them from the heart of Baghdad to rural Iraqi farms. Land Of Confusion offers a never-before seen account of working with the, then secretive, Iraq Survey Group (ISG) as they travel throughout the country searching for evidence that Saddam had the WMDs. The film reveals the extraordinary perspective of soldiers on the ground in Iraq, as recorded by one of their own and goes far beyond what the conventional mainstream media shows audiences about the war in Iraq.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7l0yoNlpQ3rLhpJkiwAm8ZUNmnq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Confusion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
