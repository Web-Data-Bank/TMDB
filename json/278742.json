An extensive collection of exotic masks is hanging on the walls while the night watchman makes his rounds. But not for long: the masks are waiting for the moment when they can reveal their imposing selves to the viewer. A collection of masks from different parts of the world shows its true face: shocking, charming or sinister. Max de Haas brings the faces to life through his camera-eye. Impressive light-and-dark effects and a chaotic music track enable the masques to tell their own stories, even when nobody is wearing them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visie Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maskerage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
