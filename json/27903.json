In REVOLUTION, Margaret tackles the axis of evil, her travels through Thailand's red light district, the explosion of child birth, bartering sex for household chores, revolutionizing one's self-esteem, the joy of bodily functions, her loser ex-boyfriend, and of course, her now world-famous mother. Known as much for her social activism as she is for her raunchy humor, Margaret is a one-of-a-kind phenomenon who once again brings her distinctive and empowering personal voice to her devoted and adoring fans.","popularity":1.084,"poster_path":"/b13GW7OwOFSICi4hbBTG0xpfQlo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margaret Cho: CHO Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":8}
