But at the han, there is a gold mine. Suddenly, Masaatsu Naito of Yunagaya Domain receives an order to perform Sankin-kotai within 5 days.  Sankin-kotai is a custom that requires the daimyo to visit the shogun in Edo. Unfortunately, the time needed to visit the shogun in Edo for Masaatsu Naito is 8 days. Masaatsu Naito also learns he received the order because a high ranking government official wants the gold mine. Also, the expense for Sankin-kotai is high and the Yunagaya Domain is such a small han that it seems impossible to complete. Nevertheless, Masaatsu Naito begins an unexpected operation to complete Sankin-kotai in 5 days.","popularity":3.109,"poster_path":"/tow08OsC8jSzzc3HPNVRufNC1LC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3034,"logo_path":"/kGRavMqgyx4p2X4C96bjRCj50oI.png","name":"TV Tokyo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":13411,"logo_path":"/yjF0FwJX69h0yGB6WvQwzUOzBln.png","name":"Hakuhodo","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samurai Hustle","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":9}
