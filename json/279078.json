Highly visual, the film examines the thrilling regional phenomenon of Cajuns who wade in murky bayou waters to catch huge catfish and turtles by reaching into hollow logs and stumps with their bare hands. Friends and family accompany the handfisherman to the bayou banks for Cajun music, festive cooking, and storytelling, and to witness this increasingly rare tradition. Told from the inside with multiple voices, Mire and Bush explore the chain of events set off by man's attempt to \"improve\" his environment by dredging bayous in this remarkable study of the relationship between cultural and natural resources.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Handfishing Story","title":"Anything I Catch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
