Legend has it that whoever marries in the Chateau is doomed to an unhappy life. This proves to be the case in 1639 and 1839, but the heroine of the 1939 segment, Corinne Luchaire, is determined to break the jinx. She is convinced that she will prove an unsuitable bride for Claude Dauphin, and he is likewise convinced that he will turn out to be an inadequate groom. But the couple's respective families will not be dissuaded, and the marriage takes place as scheduled? with unexpectedly happy results!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xjebfYJE3jlz9d1EC9GVTs0oWqk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14386,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Internationale de Productions Cinématographiques (CIPRA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1939-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cavalcade of Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
