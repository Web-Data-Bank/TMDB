Saving up for classes while she works part time in a manga store, she lives with her older, gambler brother after her father's death. When the mother she never knew turns up out of nowhere and moves in, it only causes irritation for the aspiring otaku. But when her mother just as quickly disappears, it leaves Mugiko (or \"Sweet Pea\") searching for answers, bringing her back to her mother's hometown to discover what happened to her mother's own dream.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/5FiyCLKL1p5XQV1ai1Cs1T71ZZT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stairway Films","origin_country":""},{"id":44989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phantom Film","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Little Sweet Pea","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7}
