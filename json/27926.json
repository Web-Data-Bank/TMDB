He therefore assumes his brother's identity to get to Israel hoping his distant uncle living there will help him out. The plan backfires, however, when he realizes that the uncle is a paranoid lunatic thinking the KGB is out to get him. He becomes stranded in Israel with no friends, no money, and no passport, trying to figure out a way to get back home.","popularity":1.493,"poster_path":"/ntzZ5SzkPKidulPkzsg2MNKynwn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25606,"logo_path":"/eSlqpXsyQW7u059lOnSsXtUakLl.png","name":"Gosfilmfond Russia","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":1859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ritm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1990-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passport","video":false,"vote_average":6.889,"vote_count":18}
