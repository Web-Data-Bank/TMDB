Baron Munchhausen. His crazy, yet very merriment, stories, views and behavior is what sets him apart from others. He becomes alienated from the society that failed to grasp his brilliance. In fact, his brilliance is what underlines the faults with the society itself. It's a beautiful yet tragic story that is filled with dense and intellectual dialogue.","popularity":2.984,"poster_path":"/ghN6gV4EsCwd3hjrjMNpwZEyrjX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Very Same Munchhausen","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":61}
