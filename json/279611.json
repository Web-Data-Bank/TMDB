Still pulling strings from behind bars, the kingpin’s only desire is to conceive an heir by smuggling his sperm to his wife on the outside.

But kidnapping ‘baby juice’ turns out to be fraught with even more peril than the bumbling wannabes could possibly have imagined in this cheeky spin on the gangster genre. Starring Nick Moran (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), with Julian Clary (one of Britain’s funniest) and Joe Bugner (former boxing champion and one of Australia’s toughest!).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uWapEajnr3B99iqHD5C62ljxLkR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One false move and the sperm gets it!","title":"The Baby Juice Express","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
