It was Krung Srivilai's first movie. Krung was 4 years younger than Petchara so from being the younger sister (น้อง) with Mitr, Petchara becomes the older sister (พี่)! After Mitr Chaibancha’s tragic death in year 1970, the Thai cinema needed new faces, new main actors to replace the void caused by Mitr’s premature death. Only a two minutes trailer is remaining as the movie is lost in Thailand. A full movie summary is still available as some old Thai movie stars magazines can still be found nowadays. Various sequences can be seen during those two late minutes : Sithao Petcharoen paddling a small boat on a river and watching young ladies, shootings.
