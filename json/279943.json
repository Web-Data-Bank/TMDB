Their lead guitarist is an accountant obsessed with breath mints. The bassist talks to his leg and lives by the train tracks while the drummer works to smash the state. They have no fans, no fame, and no future, but try telling that to lead singer Christian. Monday Night Gig is a comedy for anyone who's followed their dreams, no matter where they lead. And for anyone who just pulled up their skirts... and played.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/2KBugRYhhwZ9OjCzShtoazl2XHg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118704,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Smith Two Smith","origin_country":""},{"id":118705,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spiral City Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monday Night Gig","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
