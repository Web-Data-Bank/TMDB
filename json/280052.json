It included some fantastic upgrades compared to what was circulating until then, such as the Point Me At The Sky 1968 promo video, Ian Emes' animation film for One Of These Days, and restored footage from the 1970 KQED TV show. Also including a newly-restored Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) and performances of Grantchester Meadows, Cymbeline and others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xhrme1TH88OVdlafqBJh35G9Z3d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Floyd: Miscellany 1967-2005","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
