The two contrarians laugh, confide and argue, in public and in private, as they journey through three cities. And the film captures it all. The result is a magnetic conflict, a character-driven narrative that sparkles cinematically with a perfect match of arresting personalities and intellectual rivalry. COLLISION is directed by prolific independent filmmaker Darren Doane (Van Morrison: Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, The Battle For L.A., Godmoney).","popularity":1.118,"poster_path":"/3IxTKqBTMDb4lmVbFEqt4m5jHWn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crux Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is Christianity Good For The World?","title":"Collision","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8}
