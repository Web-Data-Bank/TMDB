Life in an orphanage seems impossible to her, but there's nowhere to go. She has to get used to living without homesickness, brutal among other teenagers and children's. Fortunately, there is a Tauri who behaves well, but who for some reason is not much-loved. Robi, who breaks the rules, on the other hand, is everyone's favourite, although Mari thinks she should hate him. A lesson in seeing other people around you and seeing them under the outer shell is almost unbearable for a girl, but her fate depends on it.  Based on Silvia Rannamaa's novel \"Stepmother\".","popularity":0.612,"poster_path":"/sTcV3zBRBrxYddJPCxwDTWCtaEd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1985-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Games for Teenagers","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":6}
