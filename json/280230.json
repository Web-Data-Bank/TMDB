For such an anthology the bonus features are especially poor, with a limited picture gallery and a DVD discography. The accompanying eight-page booklet does at least provide a useful insight into the making of the videos. It's also pleasing to hear the early and graceful instrumental track \"Erin Shore\" being used as the backing track for the menus.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r4Lbkg0WFfaoWmMhHdy0k5iSPbk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Corrs: Best of The Corrs - The Videos","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":4}
