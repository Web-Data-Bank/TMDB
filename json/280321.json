To do that, he has to evict his tenants from there first. Unfortunate for him, his tenant is the feisty Meera and her family, who absolutely refuses to vacate the house. Gopalakrishnan uses an obscure clause in the contract to take up residence at the house, and tries his best to smoke his tenants out.","popularity":1.875,"poster_path":"/tOWsaCUfiHRK0c4t0vAOwkkiXIp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18451,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kokers Films","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1986-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanmanassullavarkku Samadhanam","video":false,"vote_average":7.633,"vote_count":15}
