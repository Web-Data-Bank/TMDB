Huge ships move across the bay. Blue mists hover over the mountain heads.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1974-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canadian Pacific I","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
