The film as you see it was constituted by dissolving negative emulsion in a chemical solution while recording the sounds of its own making. Through an extended, repeated looking, it functions as both an index of a disappearance and the remainder of the objects, techniques and medium which is now lost.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Points of Failure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
