The album was released in 2001 by Sony Music Entertainment in response to renewed interest in the singer, after she was finally released from her contract with the label and able to sign with Sanctuary Records, regain the artistic control of her musical output and move back into the public eye - resulting in 2002 comeback album Hometime. However, there are some differences in the track listings of the two Sony compilations. The Essential Alison Moyet excludes \"Only You\", \"Situation', \"Ordinary Girl\", \"Ode To Boy II\", \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and \"Solid Wood\", and replaces them with \"Don't Go\", \"Winter Kills\", \"Our Colander Eyes\" and \"Blue\" (the latter two recorded in 1995/1996) plus cover versions \"Ne Me Quitte Pas\" and \"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5FZ6YIPaV1HsM6HM7ucSem1NKd3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alison Moyet The Essential","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3}
