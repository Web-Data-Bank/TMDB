Her new neighbor Rebecca proposes that finding herself a fantasy lover is the way to solve her problems. A little s√©ance later, and Jenny does in fact have her very own dream lover. Despite him being a beer-bellied guy with a creepy face, he seems rather irresistible and at first improves Jenny's mood quite a bit. What our heroine doesn't suspect is that her dream lover is in fact an incubus.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/tklP6QfW7bhCTsoEyyLk0kF51ET.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demon Lover","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
