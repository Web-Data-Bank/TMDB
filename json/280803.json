Meanwhile, a cop is searching for a means to bring down said gangster, who has always eluded arrest. The gangster's beautiful girlfriend, who's become a junkie under the gangster's nefarious influence, is smitten with the cop -- unaware of his profession and true motive for befriending her. Then there's a bunch of street fighting, some knives and guns, a guy who climbs over the edge of a high-rise, the same guy hanging out of the window of a speeding bus who then jumps from the bus to some hot chick's Jag, lots of striped clothing, and a red and black Toyota Celica.  The film was later dubbed in English and released by Champion International Films Co LTD as \"Billion Killers\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coliseum Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"1975-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Robbery","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
