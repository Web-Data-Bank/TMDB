Still, she is strangely dissatisfied with her life. One afternoon, a man brings his dog into her veterinary practice to be treated, and Jo recognizes him as Eli, a former housemate from her bohemian days more than 20 years ago. When he invites her to lunch at a fancy hotel in Boston, she goes with the intention of sleeping with him. Instead, Eli reveals a secret to Jo that returns her to the darkest moments of her past and threatens to destroy life as she knows it.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/zLf4E1rWZ1xnQH4yb5HtHM59FWO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Von Zerneck Sertner Films","origin_country":""},{"id":55085,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Government of Manitoba","origin_country":""},{"id":11520,"logo_path":"/q8oAysfDiYiSJQSp4UB5VNlWctW.png","name":"MFM","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":4898,"logo_path":"/nm8d7P7MJNiBLdgIzUK0gkuEA4r.png","name":"CBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"While I Was Gone","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
