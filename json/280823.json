This time the setting is the court of \"Timur the Tartar\", who has just defeated the Turkish Sultan Bajazet at the battle of Angora. There are, naturally enough, romantic complications when both Tamerlano and his ally, the Greek Prince Andronico, fall in love with Bajazet's daughter Asteria. She, however, has plans to revenge her father's defeat.\r This production was directed by Jonathan Miller and staged in the intimate surroundings of the Goethe Theatre of Bad Lauchstadt as part of the 2001 Halle Handel Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9V88IS1HOwOaLK6jl3lg1R1C0Or.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":323,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tamerlano","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
