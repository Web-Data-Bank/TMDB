Jake's old flame, BECCA, suddenly reappears back in his life after seeing her again at a local music show. Good girl Becca, never forgetting who Jake is, makes him work for it only to fall for him again. His mother, MIA, harbors a painful secret- the father Jake thought was dead is alive. To protect Jake from the pain of knowing what his father, BO, had become after a horrible accident, Mia thought it best if Jake believed BO was dead. Jake eventually has a -random- encounter with BO on the street in a Nashville suburb that sets off a chain of events to bring Bo back into his life and hopefully reconciliation to the family.","popularity":1.016,"poster_path":"/8Zywh0bMQ6NKJPFoYTtuBrXDlVy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like a Country Song","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":11}
