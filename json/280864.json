The entire story is narrated by a church-mouse called Willum, from his viewpoint. The tale begins with the pilgrim preachers deciding to move to America and getting aboard the Mayflower. However, because of the huge storm, the ship gets on the verge of sinking. Then, Willum, the pilgrim mouse, comes up with an idea to save the ship. When the pilgrims land safely, they write the Mayflower Compact and start constructing their new church and colony. However, it is already the autumn season and they do not have much food stored for the winter. The pilgrims then learn to plant crops during the spring season and celebrate a big feast toward the onset of the autumn season or fall. This is their first Thanksgiving celebration.","popularity":1.139,"poster_path":"/g4dHOlkxCzqVke8wtbQpMKTzog4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":688,"logo_path":"/65PkdDSyh6fwXgwg47x73pvgWiW.png","name":"Rankin/Bass Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of the first Thanksgiving...","title":"The Mouse on the Mayflower","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
