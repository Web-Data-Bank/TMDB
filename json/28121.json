After he sets his sights on the ultra-classy Brandi Web, he launches an all-out assault to win her heart. Ultimately, charm, lust and passion prevail, but Darnell learns the hard way that when you play, you pay.

When he finally decides to call it quits, Brandi becomes an obsessed femme fatale stalking the new love of her life.","popularity":8.482,"poster_path":"/wo9AGi5LlFXZUj8MDPq3eKCUMpd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Savoy Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":12,"logo_path":"/5ThIuO93vsk47oexKTSdfKEr7EC.png","name":"New Line Cinema","origin_country":"US"},{"id":37350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jackson/McHenry Company, The","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-04-04","revenue":34746109,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you play, you pay.","title":"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":69}
