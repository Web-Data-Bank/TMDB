He's a battle-scarred undercover cop, working in a universe where nothing seems to add up. It‘s Seattle‘s notorious Chinatown corridor, where women look like men, everyone has a hidden agenda, and anything that looks like salvation will probably pump you full of lead. When his partner is gunned down in a drug bust gone awry, Johnson is suspended for insubordination. But his thirst for the killer‘s trail remains at a lever pitch, especially when he meets Mai Lei (Gina Lim), the sexy assistant to an enigmatic preacher connected with murder. She's everything that Johnson wants; a pleasure-seeking jaguar who gets hotter near the smell of a Harley. Too bad she's a former hooker/assassin with a classified file at Army intelligence. Before he uncovers her deadly past, he'll undergo a major ATTITUDE adjustment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qyHSiOok20vCNpaqVQ8Hdj1wsYV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parallax Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":90452,"logo_path":null,"name":"Home Boy Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bad Girl.
