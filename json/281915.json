The film depicts, in a kind of fictional documentary, the 1896 Hamburg dockworkers' strike: the workers receive meagre wages for hard work and live under miserable conditions and finally go on strike (to make matters more personal, one of the strikers has a brother who is a policeman). Even though the inspiration for the story was an event that took place in the XIX century, things had little changed by the troublesome twenties so the story had a perfect contemporary ring.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tMpf5eXZIjYmSOkZ9SX8O1lEfqE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werner Hochbaum Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1929-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":8}
