An award-winning hybrid of documentary and drama that lets teenagers act out their lives in a West Yorkshire council estate. Trevor is a typical seventeen year old dosser living on a housing estate in the North of England. He smokes ‘blow’, joyrides and burgles houses, and also writes poetry. His muse is his next door neighbour, sixteen year old Amie. Every morning he works on a poem that will express his feelings and maybe win Amie’s heart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":288,"logo_path":"/aW0IpM9d4Zjj978EqgDVSxXXhTj.png","name":"BBC Film","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twockers","video":false,"vote_average":5.25,"vote_count":4}
