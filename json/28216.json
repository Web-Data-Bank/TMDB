Leuchter, Jr. Mr. Leuchter was an engineer who became an expert on execution devices and was later hired by holocaust revisionist historian Ernst Zundel to \"prove\" that there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz. Leuchter published a controversial report confirming Zundel's position, which ultimately ruined his own career. Most of the footage is of Leuchter, working in and around execution facilities or chipping away at the walls of Auschwitz, but Morris also interviews various historians, associates, and neighbors.","popularity":2.866,"poster_path":"/6k2BXIwfKv10PIV3LHzgV4OFfNO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Film Channel","origin_country":"US"},{"id":125687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fourth Floor Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":104710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Channel Four","origin_country":""},{"id":2065,"logo_path":"/uzs8PUkkOAKczujYjv91DVNRMyJ.png","name":"Scout Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-29","revenue":507941,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A.
