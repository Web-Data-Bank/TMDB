Gays in the military. Women who like jerks. Carlos Mencia has something to say about it all in his new stand-up special, Performance Enhanced, held in front of a packed house at a Hard Rock Hotel theatre in Florida. Watch as he talks about his trip to Iraq, his real feelings on the N-word, and just about everything else that pops into his head.
