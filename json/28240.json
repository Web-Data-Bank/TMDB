The bodies of inmates are kept in suspended animation while their minds are kept in a virtual reality prison. Business tycoon R.D. Crowley has found a way to capitalize on these virtual prisons by allowing rich men to pay in order to engage in a form of virtual reality hunting that has real-life consequences for the inmates. Will, a guard at one of these prisons, soon finds himself coerced into one of these virtual cat and mouse games. Armed with his knowledge of history, along with his expert skills in VR combat, Will must work with the inmates in order to save their lives and escape from the prison before it's too late.","popularity":1.614,"poster_path":"/5p68eA7e8oEG0Z5lgDEskds9r71.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Second Alarm Film Partnership","origin_country":""},{"id":101387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sultan Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cyber Vengeance","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":5}
