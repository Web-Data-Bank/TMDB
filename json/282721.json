In the first section of the film, he deftly edits a swirling montage of images - suggestive of loves gained and love lost--to the tunes of four rock songs. Fred Camper said, \"At times the words of the songs seem to relate directly to the images we see...; at other times words and images seem to be working almost at cross-purposes or relating only ironically. Similarly, at times the image rhythm and music rhythm appear to dance together, while at others they go their separate ways.\" -- Jon Gartenberg","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5GawzBQ4hFwoONJoS5iJEEfp1mI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friendly Witness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
