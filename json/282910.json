Subjects \"Bob,\" \"Missy\" and \"Steven\" have lived for over a decade with schizophrenia.  The film documents the difficult day-to-day existence of both those afflicted with this order and the families searching for answers to their loved ones' suffering.  This film also shows the varied and variably successful treatment methods for each of the subjectsâ€”one is placed in a group home, one is placed in an institution, and one is cared for at home. The documentary was critically acclaimed for its compassionate treatment of mental illness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ar / Sr Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into Madness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
