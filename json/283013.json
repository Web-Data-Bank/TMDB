Its most shocking sequences derive from the captured French film archives in Algeria containing - unbelievably - masses of French-shot documentary footage of their tortures, massacres and executions of Algerians. The real death of children, passers-by, resistance fighters, one after the other, becomes unbearable. Rather than be blatant propaganda, the film convinces entirely by its visual evidence, constituting an object lesson for revolutionary cinema.","popularity":1.271,"poster_path":"/lofBqYj9p4eefPAQlzrQ5d9SgHk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154678,"logo_path":"/ckavV5amM68To86NXoTu5dzZJJp.png","name":"Centre National du Cinéma Algérien (CNCA)","origin_country":"DZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn of the Damned","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":6}
