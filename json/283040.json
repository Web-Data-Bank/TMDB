Three women whose agronomist husbands have been sentenced to death for alleged sabotage beg him to take on the seemingly hopeless task of saving them. Sedov embarks upon a succession of encounters with increasingly powerful officials, gradually persuading them to look at the case anew. But the highest authorities are not so easily outmanoeuvered, and Sedov becomes canonised as a Stalinist zealot, with the film building inexorably to its chilling triple climax.","popularity":1.24,"poster_path":"/1Xj5RJ9Ov9e4iL4aLwDnkhDRSu3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1988-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Defence Counsel Sedov","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":5}
