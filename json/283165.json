At the height of the military dictatorship, seven friends, young as the city in which they live, dream of living in theater. Led by director Léo, the group carries out the rehearsals of a play that weaves comparisons between Jesus Christ and the cangaceiro Lampião. While political repression runs wild in the federal capital and sexual freedom is still taboo, Bia is increasingly being held prisoner by her mother's obsession, causing everyone to increasingly question the concepts and values of society.","popularity":0.743,"poster_path":"/1GALt4p2ErEe3BRUjR8jDLc8E5V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Léo e Bia","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":5}
