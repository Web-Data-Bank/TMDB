Handsome Nikola is in his mid-thirties. He earned the nickname Champ because he used to race speedboats. He makes a decent living as a free-lance architect and his apartment is spacious and comfortable. Ana is attracted by the Champ's good looks and apparent prosperity. He is always pensive though; even when he is out drinking at the local clubs with his companions he cannot help but brood about the state of Belgrade. Though the city appears fairly normal on the outside, the presence of the war is signalled when a reluctant conscript in the army is dragged away.","popularity":1.317,"poster_path":"/gCIqXqqIj3f6mGSUxF0Xq0To459.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1531,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smart Egg Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":75489,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monte Royal Pictures","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":25204,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTS","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1994-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Middle of Nowhere","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5}
