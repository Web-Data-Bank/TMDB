The professional role of the nurse has changed dramatically. Originally the nurse held an independent, curative position in healing the sick. Most of this responsibility has since been lost. In its place, a profession has developed which, while demanding altruism and dedication, is locked into a supportive and secondary role to that of the medical profession.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silver Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ronin Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Real Story of Nursing","title":"Handmaidens and Battleaxes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
