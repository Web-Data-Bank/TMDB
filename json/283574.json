Once she gets a job, her knack for creating awkward situations immediately loses it for her. Ricky is her suitor, but he gets nowhere as the girl has no time for love. So Ricky goes along with her in job hunting. Somehow, Jane lands on a job as governess. Not to a child, but to an uncouth very old, very rich man who still wants to lead the life of his poor, uncivilized youth. His son is now running the old man's millions. He wants to bring up the father the civilized way. And he wants to take over the whole city through take-over deals. He is ruthless and has thrown thousands into the streets.","popularity":0.931,"poster_path":"/twURwPCNoZHHKbfqEMqVthWRcKn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hi-Pitch Co.
