In Part One, the Metaxas regime is depicted as a circus, where Thanasis (Thanasis Vengos) is a clown trying to conceal a young colleague’s subversive action. In Part Two, we see Thanasis suffer because of his honesty and kindness, in a country where the system’s irrationality is clearly evident.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vrcpfhU5x0opsk19puja4OjiMaX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12093,"logo_path":"/a5l879HvnNElhZ5gxRWB5QVBuUp.png","name":"Finos Film","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":49481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thanasis Vengos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1976-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ο Θανάσης στη χώρα της σφαλιάρας","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
