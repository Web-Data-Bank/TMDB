Partially financed by Thorold Dickinson, Bartosch worked on it from 1933 to 1938. Very little is known about it, to the point where there are conflicting reports on whether it was in color or in black and white.  When the Nazis invaded Paris, the film was still in the editing stages. Bartosch deposited the film at the Cinémathèque Française, where it was destroyed during the Nazi occupation. Reportedly, a few still images have survived, but they are incredibly rare and aren't available online.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","title":"St Francis or Nightmares and Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
