It is a tightly knit community that is on call to protect those within its boundaries. It is an intense, turbulent, passionate world, rarely depicted other than when the antagonisms and struggles of its young lives spill out onto the surrounding streets and into the news. West 10 LDN invites us into this territory, and delves into the big stories of the lives of the young, multi ethnic generation who live there - with a blast of energy and power, with dynamism, wit and blistering vibrancy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/48TAnfjujERDnMEVzg2E9A5hzky.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28422,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stealth Films","origin_country":""},{"id":3445,"logo_path":"/7Jkq08LdnkxhK9M2LHuIOwHFfX8.png","name":"Kudos","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West 10 LDN","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
