This film asks how women's oppression can be articulated without mimicking that very expression and language which defines power relations. despite the structuring of the women's voices the film is non-narrative - here, even time is broken down.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pictures on Pink Paper","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
