Centuries later, during the cultural revolution, rebels attempted to gain possession of the vessel from the priest's descendant; however, he threw it into the ocean to keep it from being tampered. The vase was recovered years later in Hong Kong and was auctioned off to a councilman. The demon, unfortunately, escaped and took control of the councilman's body, beginning a spree of terror in the city.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":"/eD2yAPzvxaSwlQJMAP1Z756qKFu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7517,"logo_path":null,"name":"In-Gear Film Production Co.
