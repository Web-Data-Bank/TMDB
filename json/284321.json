Benjamin Wilkes, an ex-psychologist who helped Manfred select redundancy candidates, is killed in the same way as Manfred, putting disgruntled ex-Brada employees in the frame, but a third slaying implicates a former patient of Wilkes, who has connections to the Stjarne family. A newly loved-up Isabelle and Pontius start to fool around whilst on surveillance, taking their eye off the ball and allowing this suspect to confront Claire.","popularity":0.951,"poster_path":"/tvxMbeAkSs8dWvCmOxnsEU4S5re.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5746,"logo_path":"/sWgSj9muRStENKBoIoaDK6OZmDu.png","name":"Yellow Bird","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":6187,"logo_path":"/gtC63XG8fkFxszIuZIogffM1oY8.png","name":"ARD Degeto","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2802,"logo_path":"/x3cLK4hmrDxBeoD7eWbfJL2dGxP.png","name":"TV4","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":12477,"logo_path":"/tuREvnCzrM5sNXyrKRFCyB1gHF8.png","name":"Film i Sk√•ne","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wallander 24 - The Heritage","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":10}
