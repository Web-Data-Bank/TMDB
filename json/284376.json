He sets himself up in Chicago as a \"prestigious\" plastic surgeon to the stars. However, Brenton's silver tongue can't cover up his dubious methods, and an investigation into his practice is launched by the examining board of plastic surgeons. A delirious film à clef based on the loathsome career of Henry J. Schireson, the self-styled “King of Quacks”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q6XSgn0zDDR1JsuGJKFwdGFWLV5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10754,"logo_path":null,"name":"K.B.S.
