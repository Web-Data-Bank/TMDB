Robin Hyde, a young lad new in town, looks anxiously for a new home. Or just a friendly face. A middle aged man approaches, smiling. He can offer Robin somewhere to stay, and maybe some work too... RentBoy chronicles Robin's accidental descent into the dark world of gay sex for money. A world of pimps, fetish, domination and debauchery, where anything goes as long as the price is right. Max Lincoln pulls no punches in his shocking depiction of Britain's sex trade, seen through the eyes of a dazzling young cast, and energized with a brilliant Kinky Roland soundtrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aMGcpmZlirbfwN26Y6yozSQ6p2j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19755,"logo_path":"/73BIyXqVgJsDWtgTCqeKsf1afVy.png","name":"Eurocreme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RentBoy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
