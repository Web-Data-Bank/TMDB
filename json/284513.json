Monsieur Broc, a town hall employee, discovers his daughter is taken with Alban. When he rejects her, she collapses. Suddenly, the river rises and floods the village. One evening, Margot disapears… This peasant drama, adapted from a novel by André Corthis and shot during an actual flood of the Rhone, was Delluc’s last. The human madness is an echo to nature’s fury, magnified by moving images of a Provence submerged by water and mist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qzghdo91vw5MquDSKUUYN6Ebnl6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1924-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flood","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
