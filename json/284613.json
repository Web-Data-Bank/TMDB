Both are rebels: the activist against political treachery and the other on social level. Both are bitter about badly organized state of things. Being in solitary confinement, the fugitive engages himself in self-criticism and, in the process, questions the leadership. Questions are not allowed, obeying that is mandatory. Displeasure leads to bitterness, bitterness to total rift. The struggle has to continue, both for the political activist, now segregated, and the woman in exile.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/u1yX1cRvqZKFy1xcl7po4mPoPHA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mrinal Sen Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1973-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Padatik","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
