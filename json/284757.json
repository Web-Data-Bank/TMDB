He remains there today, running an experimental theatre lab working with the marginalised and underprivileged, applauded by the establishment (including former French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault) and faithful to his belief that art can change the world. These Heathen Dreams is an intimate portrait of Barnett's life and revolutionary philosophy. Combining archival footage dating back to the ‘60s with contemporary observational documentation and text from Barnett's writings, it is a poignant and inspiring study of the power of both art and political activism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20618,"logo_path":"/yGDXyW0kQUMpraYo3f1egJSkxh4.png","name":"Les Films du Balibari","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":28868,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Projects","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Journey of a Cultural Bolshevik.","title":"These Heathen Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":3}
