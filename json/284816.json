In June of 2012, four core acts from the label, LA Vampires, Ital, Magic Touch and Maria Minerva, embarked a lengthy group tour through the UK, Europe, and beyond. SILK is an expressionistic documentary that chronicles the performances, cultural environments, and global scenes through which the trip traveled. The motivating philosophies and emotions of the artists involved are visually articulated with seven fully staged dance sequences conceived and choreographed by Mecca Vazie Andrews and the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Company. SILK is a music documentary, live concert experience, essayistic travelogue and above all, dance film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4VyMEFiZjWtRzEyVaW7VPRU38rl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silk","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
