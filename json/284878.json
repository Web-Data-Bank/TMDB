The Israelites are engaged in a bloody battle against the Philistines, and Samson is the influential judge and powerful warrior who has given the war-weary Israelites a newfound sense of hope. That hope is soon diminished, however, when the irresistible Delilah ensnares the long haired Samson in a hopeless web of passion. Samson draws power from his flowing locks, and without them he is but a mortal man. The only way to defeat Samson is to shear his formidable mane, and the temptress Delilah is the only one capable of getting close enough to do so.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mkeu8KkQ3LA81ulkvX2Ea4mqNCc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samson and Delilah","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
