Well, think again! Unfortunately for Lana, she encounters Marty (Clark Gregg), a cocky, beer-guzzling plumber who is sent to Lana's address by mistake. He thinks he's stumbled upon a beautiful young business woman's attempts to seduce him. And she thinks he's the doctor that responded to her ad - although, with his tool kit in hand and his name printed on his shirt, he's a bit different than what she imagined. When the real doctor calls, life for Lana becomes even more complicated. What follows is a hilarious adventure of failed romance and twisted human relationships. Will Lana get her pipes checked? Will Marty get his tool kit back? Does it really pay to advertise?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5NhZy9emZEEGf5XE9EjDu02CUR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lana in Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
