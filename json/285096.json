Kane's history is now causing uncertainty in the team's future as Mason and Radner members of Kane's Special Investigation Unit are badly beaten by masked military-trained men. Working through the confusion that Kane's military past is causing Sarah and Juliet are after yet another serial rapist in Seattle. The SIU is put on the case only after it proves too much for Lt. Humphreys' (guest star Rachel Luttrell) Special Victims Bureau. The team's caseload continues to rise when they find the bodies of runway models killed in a fashion too disturbing for even this SIU team. Two cases are never the same and the SIU team is stretched thin by the gaining strength of Seattle's crime world in this Urban Warfare.","popularity":3.083,"poster_path":"/5MCuiFEmTuJr0Z342BcBLELI6ik.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32459,"logo_path":null,"name":"True Justice 1 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Warfare","video":true,"vote_average":5.833,"vote_count":12}
