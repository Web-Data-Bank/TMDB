But they never quite made the big time. Instead they stumbled into the curious world of children's pantomimes. Over the decades, they have built a successful business and touched the lives of generations of children; but their own dreams have slowly faded. Now aged in their 70s, with their beloved theatre under threat from a greedy property developer, Terry and Carole Ann's careers appear to be coming to an untimely close. As they battle to remain open, they are forced to reflect on the choices they have made in their lives.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29087,"logo_path":"/gqAcvTScSYmMuiw1yRfkS5AvoJs.png","name":"Waterbyrd Filmz","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Even fairytales have to end sometime.","title":"Curtain Call","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
