Fruhauf introduces this scene into his own métier, turning the \"blow-up\" metaphor into an image with a false bottom. With the aid of a digital photocopier, the strip of film was reduced in size to a narrow ribbon, and Blow-up shows this transformation in reverse.","popularity":1.345,"poster_path":"/moqCzL6unCiaRazvp0exj6Zj5rt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2001-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blow-Up","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
