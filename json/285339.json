The background, barren field and bare sky, raise the agricultural subject matter to the level of an epic poem. Using innovative editing, Shpykovskyi transformed an incredibly simple plot into an avant-garde work. Created the same year as Earth (Zemlya), the film forms a paradoxically conceptual, ideological, and aesthetic pair with Dovzhenko’s movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/erBvJqhw16HAuOuIZHetnFRbABs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/y1qBEXTFKt1TvGKKH9QAYiP3rPe.png","name":"VUFKU (All-Ukrainian Photo-Cinema Administration)","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1930-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bread","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6}
