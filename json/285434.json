In this fast-paced documentary from the director of the popular films Finger of God, Furious Love, and Father of Lights, Darren Wilson sets out to make a movie that is completely led by the Holy Spirit. No plan, no script, no safety net--just go wherever he feels the Spirit leading him to try and discover the adventure God has for him. Whether it's the riches of Monte Carlo, a heavy metal concert, or the oldest city in the world, the result is a film that not only challenges and excites, but also reveals a God who is far more alive and active than you ever imagined.","popularity":2.155,"poster_path":"/79IxCV3oLvAxcEtlr3sl4ctKkJG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29186,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wanderlust Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MC","name":"Monaco"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2014-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Be Bold.
