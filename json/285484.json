In the 1950s, in the Belgian harbor town Antwerp, there is not a lot off future for a jazz musician. Jack and his band try to earn a living by playing at weddings and the odd tea party, usually resulting in mixed emotions and hilarious scenes. Most of the time, he earns a living by unloading bananas in the Antwerp docks. Jack is convinced that New York is the place to be for a jazz musician, but where will he get the money for the big trip? And what is more important: a woman or a saxophone?","popularity":0.9,"poster_path":"/h4DNEgZRicTLriH18TImZEOouKl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Friends","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
