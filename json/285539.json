It was completed after film school and I worked with just a graphite pencil, a small group of colored pencils and animation bond. It is a trilogy of amorous dreams coming from the imagination of a woman recalling her childhood, her beloved twin so difficult to separate from and becoming an adult sexual person. The aria Sempre Libera from La Triviata by Verdi opens the film and the poem Leda and the Swan by WB Yeats ends it. It was great to work with Michael Riesman who created the sound track. I loved working in NYC in those days with Robin McDaniel, Rebecca High and others.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7OgjyaPCBNeVLa1V1Cq9AkEYohF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Odalisque","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
