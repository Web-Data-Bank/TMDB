These characters might be a bunch of losers in love who are searching for self-esteem and recognition, but what make these intertwining tales relevant today are not just the pain and longing, but also the bittersweet memories and emotional growth of Hong Kong’s post-90s generation.","popularity":0.882,"poster_path":"/bknhPwxDZsXMuBxIPWXzqgp6Hx5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radio Television Hong Kong","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2014-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncertain Relationships Society","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
