But she knew there was more that she could do.  Mario limited her.  In my imagination I saw a competitive relationship that could only go so far.  In making this film I combined the ‘real’ with the ‘constructed’, proving for myself that these two aesthetics could not fuse together; they had to remain apart working in tandem as a relationship, thus their meaning now included competition and cooperation.”  E.B.1978","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tpUcgFCnjDLmM86Y1vgm5A52jd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Imitate; We Break Up","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
