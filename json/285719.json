Bosnia had been divided in two entities, which separated the two main opposing forces of the conflict; the Serb Bosnians and the Muslim Bosnians. Two years later, in 1998, I returned to Bosnia... This movie is a diary of the two voyages, in which I deal with the memories of the war, the death and destruction and with the victim’s struggle who don’t know how to return home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iOWChw6oAAbuouZjL2WHIAjMGzn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2006-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The diary of two travels to Bosnia (1996 and 1998) and the clash with the memories of war.","title":"Bosnia Diaries","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
