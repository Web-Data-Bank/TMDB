Led by the local nobleman (Arthur Ehrens), they find an appropriate spot, and the festivities begin. Some children briefly perform a charming folk dance. Suddenly the Rübezahl arrives and threatens to kill all the townsfolk if they don't leave immediately.","popularity":0.77,"poster_path":"/4wkHi8nwKJzEjReK7oTZdfiapN6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions-AG Union (PAGU)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1916-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rübezahl's Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
