The tour visited the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia for the first time, selling 360 000 tickets in this leg only. Madonna's inspiration for the name of the tour was a painting called \"Girlie Show\" by Edward Hopper. The tour is estimated to have grossed over US$70 million. Two separate television specials were broadcast during the tour, one made during the Japanese leg of the tour and shown only on Japanese television; Madonna Live in Japan 1993 – The Girlie Show and an HBO special Madonna Live Down Under – The Girlie Show which was later released in 1994 by Warner Music Vision on home video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aUkQYFvZ8FRj6v1iC1LxxqG0ZhR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live from Fukuoka","title":"Madonna: The Girlie Show Live in Japan 1993","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
