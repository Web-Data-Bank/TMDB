The words, melody, and interpretation of this song fills my eyes with tears when I hear it...the disc is worth it for this number alone.  -Alejandra Vernon","popularity":1.254,"poster_path":"/kSdcqFH91KzqcUumjKzUESrxteR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Premier Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The top Holiday songs by the Gaithers and friends.","title":"Christmas a Time for Joy","video":true,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
