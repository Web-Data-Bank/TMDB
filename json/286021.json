Drawing on his own experience in trying to help a young runaway who eventually committed suicide, Friessner wrote into Jimmi’s story several older students who attempt to find work for him, and who give him shelter for a time in their commune.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pelrQrVehLFuqc8ZOUznlsOo4P9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1979-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
