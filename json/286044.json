A ten-year-old boy called Guido enters a Catholic seminary, fascinated by the idea of becoming a priest. He quickly understands that in order to be a good seminarian he has to submit to an ascetic and unnatural training, consisting in mortification of the flesh, obsession with sin and repression of one's sexual instincts and desires.

A system in which thinking for oneself is forbidden.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seminarian","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":10}
