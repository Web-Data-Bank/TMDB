I have taken a high quality \"A Glimpse of Eternity\" testimony in windows media, converted and created this DVD to play in most DVD players. The DVD is approximately 1 hour long.  This is a reenactment of what had happened to Ian and a round table interview after the reenactment.  This DVD is a real-life testimonial experience of what this man endured during his real-life visit to Hell and then Heaven!  \"My sincere hope is that this testimony is the closest you will ever come to experiencing hell for yourself.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/phcgVcozHB1oAJHDXHMrorsolst.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We don't know when our end will be —Are You Ready?","title":"A Glimpse Of Eternity","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
