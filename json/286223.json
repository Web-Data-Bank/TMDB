One evening, while strolling through the subdivision painted up as his alter ego Shadow Zombie, Kim catches the eye of a registered nurse and part-time clown Brandi. What follows is a brief romance marked by destruction by the very real phantoms emanating from Kim's dead-end present and Brandi's traumatic past. Shooting under near-documentary conditions in and around Lafayette, Louisiana, Jorge Torres-Torres operates peopling his film with a coterie of genuine Acadiana misfits. The merciless and at times unexpectedly poignant observation of Kim's world dares to see through to the human core of a drug addict or clinically depressed clown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/raS6W2hQVcEannGjKuqFnBJlwra.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blackout Films","origin_country":""},{"id":29614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cantina Filmworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Meet Kim Filth and enter his horror film existence...","title":"Shadow Zombie","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":3}
