But as this intimate film reveals, his work is suffused with the trauma of migration, and the struggle to recognise himself as a â€˜new Australian'. In conversation with documentarian Steven McIntyre, Dirk guides us through more than 40 years of his filmmaking: the early years exploring technique and technology, a subsequent phase of unflinching self-examination brought on by upheaval and overseas travel, and more recent projects where he attempts a fusion of personal, cultural, and historical identity. What emerges is an inspiring, rugged, and at times poignant portrait of an artist committed to self-expression and self-discovery through the medium of film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urni Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first retrospective examination of filmmaker Dirk de Bruyn's prolific and prodigious career.","title":"The House That Eye Live In","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
