Everybody is celebrating the 600th birthday of the local hero, Otto the Ironman, who in his time saved the duchy from annexation and beat the enemy so badly, that he fled ... well, that’s what it says in the history books, at least.  Local gossip asserts, however, that Otto wasn’t even part of the battle and was spending his time having fun with a pretty girl.  When one day a piece is introduced at the court theatre, which tells the heroic story of Otto, the director rejects the mediocre story.","popularity":0.727,"poster_path":"/4YcEbl3pZFVL4h0DtJVTT9gVstn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bavaria-Filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1942-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kleine Residenz","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
