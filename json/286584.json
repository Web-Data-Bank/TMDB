He goes to Paris to start a new life. His only possession is a painting which his father left him, along with the advice: \"If you ever need to sell the painting, do so in France, where it's worth a fortune.\" But Michel discovers that his father's tumultuous and secret past comes along with the valuable painting. Meanwhile, Clara, a middle age Spanish-Argentine mother gets a strange present from a now dying childhood friend in Buenos Aires. It's a roll of Super 8 film which brings back very strong, and emotionally charged memories from the 1970s and before.","popularity":0.695,"poster_path":"/tpfpCG0Z4Zm2Jh9pN2A0xcwtaLx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mallerich Audiovisuales S.L.","origin_country":""},{"id":1907,"logo_path":"/iewCUqwZrf57DwvtaC0Un0M6Ab9.png","name":"Manga Film","origin_country":""},{"id":1848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2004-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dans le rouge du couchant","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
