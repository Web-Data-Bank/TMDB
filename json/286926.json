Making things a tad difficult, however, is that the weapon is located deep beneath the ocean. Nevertheless, the Third Eye plans on experimenting with the device in little more than a week. However, the Secret Service has other ideas and asks \"Jerry,\" their super computer, to locate the best man to stop them: Mark Andrews (RODD DANA), a special forces secret agent who infiltrates the criminal gang under the cover of a robber who just happens to be an expert underwater diver! He also wastes no time romancing all manner of shapely women in the tightest clothes imaginable (when they're wearing more than a modestly placed bed sheet) especially JANINE REYNAUD, the bisexual leader of The Third Eye, who sports a wild wardrobe of very revealing outfits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/95tZkujPY6eBvLd8Wtb639y3JBI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madison Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1966-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation White Shark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
