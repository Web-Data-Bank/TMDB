Nesibe knows that there has to be something more to life, and she finds it at the movies. As she recalls her childhood and adolescence, her own memories merge with scenes from the dozens of musicals, melodramas, and romances she saw to fill her days and to escape the desperation of her home life. But as she moves into adulthood, the contradiction between Nesibe’s cinematic dream life and everyday reality starts to affect her in unexpected ways.","popularity":0.684,"poster_path":"/4rnIEVnLVX8KuRcbSbwH5IPayJK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gülşah Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1990-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Cinemas","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
