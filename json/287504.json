He’s a guy who goes to school, has a girlfriend and some good friends. He has a small gambling addiction, which makes his relationship with his mother difficult. It’s also hard because the two of them live alone and the mother doesn’t miss a chance to remind him that his father is in prison and that Modris has a bad gene. Their relationship boils over when, in the middle of a Nordic winter, Modris pawns his mother’s electric heater in trying to squeeze a win from a slot machine. She betrays him to the police and Modris is sentenced to two years’ probation. That is when his adventures with the Latvian justice system begin and he sets a new goal: to find the father he has never met.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eNYMoezszqMTaHbvlmCvOhK1YOr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146203,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Dot Media","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":15113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boo Productions","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":63583,"logo_path":"/bu6zssHeJRGPuQ5xL8IyOVsRyfP.png","name":"Sutor Kolonko","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modris","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
