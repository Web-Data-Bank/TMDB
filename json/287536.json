The film moves the focus from the game to the field's margins, to the fans, to outside the stadium. The movie intends to capture the tension, atmosphere and charm of a final match. SATELLITES translates, based on images captured during that game, the sensation of being at the stadium watching the game with no images of the game itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tMFw0g5ngDAsqq3YFEdUCgTwH9J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satellites","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
