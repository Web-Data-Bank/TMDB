On every continent, beekeepers have seen the collapse of their colonies, a phenomenon that threatens the foundations of agriculture. The Ailing Queen follows Anicet Desrochers, a young, passionate beekeeper in the Laurentian mountains of Quebec as he works through the seasons to strengthen his colonies' natural resistance and spread the word about his methods. Desrochers is a pioneer of a more ecological method of managing bees, the fields they pollinate and, ultimately, the food we live by.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La reine malade","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
