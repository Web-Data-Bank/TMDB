After a deal is struck the mismatched pair sets out on a three day odyssey of misadventure along the highways and byways of America where they encounter rat infested hotels, convenience store hold ups, rural rabbit stalkers and a starstruck couple from a local trailer park. Best of all, they are forced to encounter each other as the two worlds of the princess and hermit collide at each and every turn. A humorous retelling of The Story of The Prodigal Son, told through the eyes of a young woman looking to make amends while she searches for the road back home.","popularity":1.16,"poster_path":"/9CyfDSt5uO4wmo5QyScbJWrAhq9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kelly's Filmworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes going home again can darn near kill you.","title":"Pieces of Easter","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
