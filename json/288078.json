Taking its cue from the realist tradition, the film counterposes an idyllic rural life (destroyed but the greedy money-lender who uses forged papers to steal the peasant's land) with the harsh city life. The shot of a hut accompanied by a howling dog are regarded as one of the most memorable moments of Indian cinema to date.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Savkari Pash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
