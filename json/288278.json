Every day while walking home from work, Albi passes a fork in the road. The left fork leads him to the safe life; the life that he knows. The right fork is unknown. The Narrator refuses to let Albi travel that road. Enter Effie: the new girl in the office, she catches Albi's eye and the Narrator begins to feel threatened by her presence. He crushes Albi's confidence at every turn. Rapidly losing faith in the voice that he has been beholden to his entire life, he begins to ponder the appeal of breaking free...and the temptation of the right fork.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2013-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fork","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
