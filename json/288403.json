It's her only dream and reason of life to hang her pictures in a gallery. However, unlike her expectations, the world doesn't recognize her talent and only forces unreasonable compromise. She continues everyday with resentment and pain from the world. Chang-min (Park Jae-jeong) has a special talent which allows him to feel a person's feelings; he feels her pain and pities her. He was born with a gift he didn't ask for and has experienced abandonment from his loved ones. He feels love for Soo-yeon and so does she. Meanwhile, Soo-hyeon is given a dangerous offer to compromise with authority if she wanted to see light as an artist.","popularity":0.688,"poster_path":"/OutRYtkfFM6cQ9yP3RFHfz6z3v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2014-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The world's greatest sketch of love between a torn man and a woman begins here.","title":"Sketch","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
