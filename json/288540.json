He has his plans, he has his team, all he needs is a loan from the bank. Bernie is a young loan broker on the last day of his apprenticeship. He has to seal a deal - preferably one that won't sink the bank into receivership or ruin it's reputation - or he's back working on the tellers - if they'll have him, his boss Greg warns. Bernie and Colossomus eventually come to an agreement, without either compromising their principles, and a reluctant hero emerges.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":30907,"logo_path":null,"name":"iFlow Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who would of thought world domination would be so complicated!","title":"Deathly Acquisitions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
