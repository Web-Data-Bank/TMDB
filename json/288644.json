Coming from very different worlds, anxiety is the only thing they have in common. One of them is Antonieta Sanchez, a single mother who has made ends meet for herself and her son, Odulio, by washing clothes and ironing. She knows she has lost her son a long time ago: Odulio is a young criminal. The night he was shot, Antonieta's life changed forever. The other is Benigno Robles, an assistant district attorney who, as a young law student, devoted his career with hope and deeply rooted ideals of justice. When Elisa, his only daughter, is hit by a stray bullet, Benigno will never be the same. But this encounter between Antonieta and Benigno, seemingly coincidental, is not: there is a secret that will eventually come to light","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":103030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alfarería Cinematográfica","origin_country":""},{"id":114124,"logo_path":"/kFBKWa13gxWg1tB8GQOMqgPm4y8.png","name":"Jerico Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":114125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Procine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2008-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
