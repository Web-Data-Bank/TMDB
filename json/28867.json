When the signal from one of the transmitters suddenly disappears, a team of soldiers led by Major Elbert Stevens and cave specialists led by Rupert 'Wolf' Wolfsen including scientist Leslie Peterson are sent in to find out what happened.  Exploring deep underground, they stumble upon a tribe of albino cave-dwellers who have apparently been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years. The cave-dwellers are hurt by radio frequencies and are able to see in infra-red frequencies, tracking the explorers by their body heat.","popularity":0.772,"poster_path":"/fQ19sWvrfKWjsmkvfDfU8FrUzEr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adams Apple Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Underground, no-one can hear you die!","title":"What Waits Below","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":11}
