Ariana is claimed by the Maniapoto  people as one of their own and, despite Robert's chivalrous  defence, is taken by them and must help them prepare for war.  Robert likewise must do his patriotic duty and enlists to  fight on the other side. He volunteers to ride despatch,  thinking it may give him an opportunity to see Ariana again,  which it does, but their joy is short-lived; Maniapoto women  fight beside their men, and furthermore she is a Rangitira  (noble) and will not let her people down. The climax is the siege  of Oraku Pa where 300 Maori hold off 2000 troops for three days.  The Maniapoto are defeated, but Ariana, although wounded,  survives to be reunited with Robert.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3rYmUtROxAtbYCsQgVvCasVJba.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frontier Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1940-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If men can die, the women and children can die also.","title":"Rewi's Last Stand","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
