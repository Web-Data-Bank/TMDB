We are not exploiting Chagall's images, but are attempting to create a dramatized projection of his creativity onto the movie screen, relying on both, facts and fantasy (as Chagall himself would).The story is based on real events which occurred at the time of Chagall's short-lived period in Vitebskin in 1917-18, during which time he creates the Academy of Modern Art, inspired by his dreams of a bright and beautiful future. Many pictures by Chagall and Malevich are used in the film.","popularity":1.084,"poster_path":"/wSMD8J5GQ2huCiYVm8FpVHEVM45.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Company ShiM Film","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":19124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marmot Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chagall-Malevich","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":8}
