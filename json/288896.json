Diyari (Kurdo Galali) has come from his new homeland, America, to put up a badly needed new orphanage. As construction proceeds, he gradually becomes acquainted with the tragic individual stories of the survivors. Prime among these is orphan girl Jiyan (Pirsheng Berzinji), and her lively young cousin Sherko (Choman Hawrami). Although he seems to fit right into life in this impoverished town, Diyari can hardly absorb the catastrophe that hit there, nor can he accept the level of injury that he encounters. When the orphanage is ready, Diyari says his goodbyes, plunging Jiyan back into quiet despair.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jiyan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
