La maison rose (the pink house) is an old mansion in Beirut where the Nawfal family found shelter during the Civil War. Unfortunately for them, their immediate environment is rapidly changing, as many of the old shell-ridden buildings are being torn down and replaced by new construction projects. When Mattar, the owner of the pink house, decides to sell it to make room for a large commercial centre, the residents of the neighbourhood become divided between the shopkeepers and businessmen in favour of a different kind of modernity.","popularity":1.151,"poster_path":"/aZQiSRdkoDYCr7WhVtcuu1tXGQz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal (II)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":31158,"logo_path":null,"name":"CCT","origin_country":"LB"},{"id":22029,"logo_path":"/asH5UhhC8dRUUExZKIis0Y3dyjy.png","name":"Canal+ Horizons","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Around the Pink House","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
