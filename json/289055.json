Grainy fragments of landscapes, flakes whirl in the wind. Fog and mist, shadows of people in the city and by the waterâ€¦ Silhouettes that fade and turn into pure light and shadow until we discern the specks and scratches on the film strip itself. Sometimes, for a fraction of a second, a face, a person. A film as a memory that eludes us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AbYjlbD0yA9mb4jt81WKYgWUVYO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4508,"logo_path":"/sUq2S2ndKxp1B2NjbMJbSNlPI8V.png","name":"Nederlands Fonds voor de Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Touch","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
