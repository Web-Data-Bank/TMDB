On their sons' 21st birthday, Eckberg tells them the great family secret:  Knut and Michael aren't his children (happy birthday, kids ... oh!  and did I mention Santa Claus doesn't exist either?).  But thankfully, the news gets better:  their real mother died giving birth to them (guilt trip ... guilt trip!) and the Eckbergs decided to adopt the boys and bring them up in a proper family (no doubt so they could shatter their lives with this tale on their 21st birthday).  But hey:  it made everyone forget about the War going on outside the theatre, right?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1943-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sophienlund","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
