He was a monk, a cultural historian, an author, a teacher, and a mystic. He saw his life work as waking us up to that sacred story. He called us \"mad\" for the way we are despoiling our home, our planet, its beauty, and its living systems. He was a force that reminded us that we are living through the greatest extinction spasm of the past 65 million years. We are the ones responsible. Berry urged us to change our ways.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thomas Berry: The Great Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
