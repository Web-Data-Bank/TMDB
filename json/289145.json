The womenfolk, those too old and those too young are left behind... and as the years pass, only letters return, telling tales of loneliness and hard-times. A young man, Ahmed, grows-up under these surroundings and has to deal with being the de-facto man-in-charge; when several of the migrant workers return one day, everyone has to come to terms with things being forever changed.","popularity":1.58,"poster_path":"/o1FB4RNF9a5UcY4BE5YD5rF0T5x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Misr Arab Films Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"1999-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Date Wine","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
