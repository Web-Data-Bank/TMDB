This is how Armando meets a pretty young woman with whom he begins a tentative courtship. But soon a rift grows between the siblings and, spurred by Armando’s exaggerated stories about his nascent relationship, Beatriz begins experiencing aural hallucinations that can only be remedied through music and, finally, the love of a stranger. Pinto made this impassioned fairy tale as part of a series of films about the four elements. - FilmLinc","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/wx3zgFUZGe4bJgi2feCQqCuUA2O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twin Flames","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
