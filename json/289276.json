From 250 to 270 to 290 pounds, he continued to grow, until he set his sights on weighing 320 pounds. Pushing the human body beyond its limits, despite one injury after another, and even recognizing “a sign to stop,” Tony carries on, determined to earn his nickname as “The King of Size.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The King of Size","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
