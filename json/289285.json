Paul meets Maggie Mutt, and Paul, being a pedigree canine and somewhat of a cad, lures trusting Maggie to the barn to have his way. He then departs for his palatial doghouse at the Livingston estate. Meanwhile Maggie is broken-hearted and also finds that she is in a \"family way\", and gives birth to a pup she names Hank. Maggie tells Hank to find his \"human \", and departs the scene. Hank goes to the park, meets a \"human\" named Mary Kelly, who is a homeless waif and sweetheart of poverty, and the two adopt each other. Later on in the park Paul comes strolling along with his 'human', John. A child falls into the lake and Paul and Hank team up to save her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/moQ1nav0MND8j1XknJh0Qi5WmQ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28230,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeMille Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almost Human","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
