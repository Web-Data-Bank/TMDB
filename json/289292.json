But in reality, the rather imaginative ninth grader has trouble moving up to the next grade. Fortunately, his teacher Nickel notices that Otto does not lack intelligence, but the ability to use his imagination for the requirements of everyday school life. Together with school director Menschke, Nickel tries to change Otto’s attitude. Although this is easier said than done, Otto eventually realizes that he has to try to build his cloud-castles only after school has ended. And his teacher is going to support him in his attempts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3YT6hXkAIVBpTpdMJOb1amT0DeD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1971-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men Without Beard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
