At first it appears as a cosy night of sofa lounging, snack eating and film. But it soon becomes evident that beneath the façade of relaxed mutuality, there is a relationship based on insecurities and demands. Due to a fight, the parents cut their evening short, and when they return, the situation gets out of hand and feelings of hurt lead to abuse. Adolfsson paints a gruesome picture of adolescent love and how fears and expectations can completely override a young person’s will.","popularity":0.771,"poster_path":"/7FSR6pfacBJmDcsqI0IKSGPahlj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2007-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spending the Night","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5}
