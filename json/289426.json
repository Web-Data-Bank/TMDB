Isabelle and Portus witness this and give chase but are attacked by the criminals and hospitalized. Given the security firm's meticulous contingency plan Wallander suspects a leak from the inside and aims for Micke Sterner, a compulsive gambler and the only staff member to know the encoded transit schedules. But some private sleuthing by over-worked Svartman, who has found the robbers' den, and Wallander's suspicions of an ex-cop turned security officer with connections to the firm provide the real break-through.","popularity":1.292,"poster_path":"/nFJwMW8g3Q0vIBFI4ntH6Yf6cvL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5746,"logo_path":"/sWgSj9muRStENKBoIoaDK6OZmDu.png","name":"Yellow Bird","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":6187,"logo_path":"/gtC63XG8fkFxszIuZIogffM1oY8.png","name":"ARD Degeto","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2802,"logo_path":"/x3cLK4hmrDxBeoD7eWbfJL2dGxP.png","name":"TV4","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":12477,"logo_path":"/tuREvnCzrM5sNXyrKRFCyB1gHF8.png","name":"Film i Skåne","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2009-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wallander 20 - The Leak","video":false,"vote_average":5.909,"vote_count":11}
