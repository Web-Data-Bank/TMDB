Yet it requires no prior knowledge at all: it truly is for someone starting “from scratch”.  Slowly but surely, the tutor guides you through all the things that a beginner needs to know and, very importantly, points out what can go wrong. Each of the carefully designed chapters introduce commonly used scales and technique gradually and strategically, along with some practical theory – nothing too demanding, just enough to help you understand what you’re doing and why.  You’ll soon be playing scales, picking out melodies and, hopefully, writing some songs of your own! Making music has never been so easy!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A complete bass guitar course for absolute beginners","title":"Bass Guitar From Scratch","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
