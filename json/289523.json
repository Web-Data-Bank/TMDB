A trademark infringement lawsuit against a rival company brings Elyse to Higgins Attorneys and Sons, where Rob Carelli, a young, too-nice-for-his-own-good lawyer, is bullied by his boss, firm founder Carter Higgins, and his two arrogant sons. Despite his workplace woes, Rob becomes instantly smitten with Elyse.  With Halloween just around the corner, Elyse invites the Higgins law firm staff to an opulent masked Halloween costume ball. Rob obeys an order to remain in the office working that night, but has a change of heart when his spunky, 12-year old niece Ruby, convinces him to attend the ball wearing a prince costume. After a magnificent waltz and magical exchange with the handsome \"prince,\" Elyse yearns to locate this mysterious man and hopefully find the romance her life has been missing.","popularity":5.17,"poster_path":"/b1FOZOfVWnUGOybxO016ODaRbVt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Domino productions","origin_country":""},{"id":63939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Howard Braunstein Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midnight Masquerade","video":false,"vote_average":5.885,"vote_count":39}
