This rich and varied environment is a product of a unique set of natural circumstances.  The equatorial sun powers ocean currents among the tiny dots of land. Where the archipelago meets the western tip of New Guinea an intersection of ocean currects creates perhaps the world's richest reefs - in the region of the Rajah Ampat Islands.  A coral reef houses a myriad of colors, shapes and patterns: from the bulb tentacle anemone which protects, and in turn is protected by, the brightly coloured clownfish; to the multi-branched gorgonian, home of the tiny pygmy seahorses.","popularity":0.629,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9028,"logo_path":null,"name":"Razor Digital Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Equator - Reef of Riches","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
