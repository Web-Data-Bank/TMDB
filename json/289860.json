The fun begins when one bets the other $20,000 that he, with an all girl crew, be the first to Tahiti in a sailboat race. The other, not to be outdone, has a few monkeyshines up his sleeve and actually wins the race. The beaten bettor then makes the claim, that he can beat the victor to the mainland using a crew comprised of baboons. That is too much to resist for the other and the race is on.","popularity":0.711,"poster_path":"/sYNk9xonWrQH7uV72SsdQCa30Wq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31501,"logo_path":null,"name":"United National","origin_country":""},{"id":13754,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Telefilm Associates (NTA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's ship-shapely all-girl crew took turns shaping up for the captain's watch","title":"I Sailed to Tahiti with an All Girl Crew","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
