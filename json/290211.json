Stefan ends up saving the life of young Christine and becomes her fiancée.  Christine, however, is Nora’s daughter  (can’t see where this is heading, huh?).  When Christine finds out that mom and her hubby-to-be had a rather intimate history, she takes a boat ride on a stormy lake.  But the prophecy of disaster associated with the bronze figure “Melusine” does not come to pass:  Stefan looks for Christine, finds her in one piece and stays with her.  Nora, for her part, decides incest might be a bad thing and gives up Stefan forever to go back to the man she divorced (hey, way to feel wanted!).  For some reason, the Nazis didn’t like the plot’s moral message and banned it after its completion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m0c70kQkqGcZvbSm3huyT3VKQcL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1944-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melusine","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
