The mother of two children, who has just been left by her unfaithful husband, actually types six correct numbers in the lottery, but the receipt for the lottery ticket disappears. The lucky finder is her new chance acquaintance Felix, who at first has no idea whose winnings he is holding in his hands. When he finds out, it is already too late: Astrid already knows that he has kept the lottery win from her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kVJsFqqH2coWVV5gDKWenODYA5e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lottoschein ins Glück","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
