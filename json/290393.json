Now, he's in Vienna with his daughter, the city of his fondest memories since studying there as a boy. It doesn't take long for the charm of Vienna to work its magic on the former king: he quickly comes to terms with the new situation and is able to enjoy the Austrian capital sans all the ceremony and trappings which would otherwise accompany him on a state visit. The princess is content with preparing herself for a career as a pianist concert, while the former king takes a job as a chauffeur in the embassy of the country he once ruled. The revolutionaries are shocked; and his days in Vienna are numbered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y02r6XFdKJyWpeqYmDHVH2hfRko.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1586,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sascha-Verleih","origin_country":""},{"id":26934,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lux-Film Wien","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1957-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vienna, City of My Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
