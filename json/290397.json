Amongst the flora and fauna of these enchanted volcanic islands, Darwin formulated his groundbreaking theories on evolution. Journey with Attenborough to explore how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, and how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. Encompassing treacherous journeys, life-forms that forge unlikely companionships, and survival against all odds, Galápagos tells the story of an evolutionary melting pot in which anything and everything is possible.","popularity":1.273,"poster_path":"/kr4pZr44iNICx5NTaIetQupt90D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadshow Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2013-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Galapagos with David Attenborough","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":7}
