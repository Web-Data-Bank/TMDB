Mingled with the intensity and unpredictability of a “one night stand,” they generate unique sensations – mixed emotion, risk, and excitement. The film employs formal devices in a manner that is exceedingly simple, yet very effective. Its subject matter, sexuality and communication, gains depth and poignancy through the artist’s decision to shoot the film’s three scenes for projection in a “double screen” configuration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h7unGMQ7YAw39TKoxJR672l1rfu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ten Cents a Dance: Parallax","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
