Actually, Guida gets to demonstrate a few comic styling of her own as a bohemian theater \"actress\" who lives in cramped apartment with a whole bunch of other clothing-averse bohemian types. She is very devoted to her older beau Buzzanca, but his life is very complicated due to his own devotion to his very big and very old dog, the ironically named \"Piccolo\" (basically \"Tiny\"), and his even older grandmother. In order to take care of these two dependents, he forsakes his loyal girlfriend for a rich female pharmacist (Andrea Ferriola) and moves in with her and her haughty bourgeois mother and aunts--with disastrous results for all involved.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/i2jWITUCjHrfosvLS8euyYU9CeF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1429,"logo_path":"/n1GvY0KLgk3gcEPO07L7nXncB3i.png","name":"Italian International Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmes International","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1978-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swept Away by Family Affection","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
