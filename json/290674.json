Stanley's success as a novelist has been largely due to his style where he writes from the first person perspective of the central characters, who are always the killers in real-life cases. Troubled with writer's block, his agent suggests a tramping trip \"to clear his mind\". However, when he wakes up on the first morning of his tramp, he finds his fellow tramper dead.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/apWVBGHFfcVR154Ed5BzHQqb2Pe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Six String Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":17761,"logo_path":"/fvvFNvMUsRGTP1MUqWQKHMMc8a1.png","name":"Four Knights Film","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2009-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Trust No One...Not Even Yourself","title":"I'm Not Harry Jenson","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
