The guy is bad news and has everybody fooled, except Mr. Dite, an advertising executive and recent recipient of Mike’s services as a whip-wielding sadist. Taking advantage of the weak-willed masochist, Mike blackmails Dite into giving him a cushy job, then takes advantage of his new position by stealing Dite’s clients, seducing Dite’s elegant daughter, Sara, and climbing his way up the social ladder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7wXdllGbBdDuBsi6yEnXcHLGMWN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mostest Productions Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":5947,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jerand Film Distributors","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's a Crazy, Mixed-up Dirty World They Live In!","title":"Too Much Too Often!","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":7}
