Both hilarity and hypocrisy ensue as we follow these characters when they are all thrust into real life situations where not just their lives are at stake, but their faith, preconceptions, and perspectives as well. Throw in some Tarantino loving film making, and just a hint of Kevin Smith-esque writing, and you get Jesus Fish.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jesus Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
