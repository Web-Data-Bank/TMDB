Played in Queens Park Rangers stadium in London, England, UK with Seals &amp; Crofts, Gryphon, and Ace. The shot is pro, the audio is soundboard, but apparently not a multi-track. This was originally a bootleg, and then later re-leased on DVD by former band manager Brian Lane without band involvement or blessing. Generally considered the best concert video of the tour.
