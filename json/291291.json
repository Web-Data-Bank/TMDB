The film tracks the opposition struggle during few post-election days. The movie shows the falsehood of the official propaganda and the ambiguous, sometimes polar, attitude of simple people. Assembling together all the debris of the opinions, comparing different historical events, jeering at dictator's arrogance and manners, admiring courage and dedication of the young generation, the feature approaches the understanding of what is really going on in the middle of Europe. And one more thing -the director's sarcastic comment throughout the film does not make you bored!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vmd95HlD7PuO0JSefpidtBVgNeL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95085,"logo_path":"/a2jrXBJdeqBhA1nMp37CqEQ1T3m.png","name":"Baltic Film Production","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2008-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kalinovski Square","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
