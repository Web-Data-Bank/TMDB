At first, Flore is placed in a specialized institution and, with her condition getting worse, was destined to a prison like facility, medicated to a state of near-stupor. Watching her condition steadily decline, Lièvre, heartbroken and desperate, takes Flore out of the institution in a wheelchair and installs her in a house in corsica. there, surrounded by the sea, the sun and the wind, and no longer medicated, she begins to walk, smile and even paint again. chronicling Flore’s life over three years, he learns that the debilitating condition is not something you die with, it’s something you live with. What began with a cell phone camera recording the negative effects of drugs, became a touching film about hope, about recovering dignity, and ultimately, about a son’s gratitude.","popularity":0.615,"poster_path":"/xNxeMIc44ubDQAU5hg5tY2pAF54.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flore","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
