Her first novel is rejected, her non-committal boy friend decides to take a powder, her best friend moves to Mexico for an acting job, and her mother announces that her long presumed dead father is actually a hippie photographer who has come to town to meet her. Sinking into a depression at being a total failure at 28, she starts fantasizing about suicide. In her depths of despair she meets various eccentric characters including a chain-smoking Santa Claus and an obnoxious literary agent. But her belief in herself is only restored when she meets a patient in a hospital where she does volunteer work.","popularity":1.578,"poster_path":"/hHxhjqeL2k8pm4w4WfTF6srx1HQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viewfinder Films","origin_country":""},{"id":60149,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inertia Entertainment Partners","origin_country":""},{"id":60150,"logo_path":null,"name":"StellarQuest Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sky is Falling","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
