A search quickly reveals a conspiracy involving rogue Shaolin monks, powerful ruling families, and ever mysterious deadly Green Dragon Gang. When the dagger is used in a murder, and an unknown man is found barely alive in a box at the bottom of a river, the questions get more numerous, and trust is something that comes and goes quickly as the wind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bpWbCyZdhEzVgz1vcP7Trh5xTRF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tung Hai Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1979-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruce Tuan 7-Promise","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
