The three films \"go\" very directly together, in the order of their making (as listed); yet each seems to be a clear film in itself. At this time, I tend to think they constitute a \"Chapter No. 2\" of The Book of Film I've had in mind these last five years (considering SCENES FROM UNDER CHILDHOOD as Chapter No. 1); and yet these \"Weir-Falcon\" films occur to me as distinct from any filmmaking I have done before.
