What does it mean to survivors of acid violence? What does it mean to people in their environment? How do the two world-views interact? What do concepts of 'fear', 'power', 'innocence' and 'beauty' mean to us? The Newborns attempts to provide a lens to the survivors of acid violence, to look forward and gaze back. They take us through the ennui of their domestic and public spaces in a nameless dystopian city, its factories, houses and motels, and its promises, never honored.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8UXRrHOBsb3TjHMvbBj0bqP0YJu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2014-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Newborns","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":6}
