He loves snakes, to the point that he owns many and even takes a bath with his huge pet python. He meets and falls in love with a beautiful young woman named Malenka, who is the assistant--and mistress--of an older herpetologist professor. Marc discovers that not only is the \"professor\" a fraud but also a dangerous psychotic who had at one time seduced Marc's mother, and Marc believes that the longer Malenka stays with him, the greater danger she's in.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/dAcegzoHjFJ9PjWeagZXUpuvZwj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venins","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
