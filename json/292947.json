From 1980 to 1990 they were billed as Exude.  They had a college playlist hit with \"Boys Just Want to Have Sex\" and got two videos on MTV. In 1990 they changed their name to NC-17 and revamped their style into a grungier more Floyd-influenced sound.  Filmmaker Dov Kelemer made a documentary of their career struggles. Once the movie was completed--it played on cable, at film festivals, and a few theaters.  It's available from the www.anybodylisten.com site.  NC-17 has since become inactive, as the members have scattered over several different states. Lead vocalist Frank Rogala remains active on the OC music scene.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Won't Anybody Listen","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
