In Vitagraph’s adaptation of the tale, the first movie version made in America, an army officer in some unpronounceable Central European town directs Jinks to repair his gear. Hounded by his nagging wife, the cobbler dons the officer’s uniform and parades about town. The impersonation proves so convincing that the burgomeister awards Jinks the officer’s bonus. When the ruse is discovered, the court gives Jinks a choice: two years in jail or at home with his wife. The film ends with cobbler pondering the pros and cons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Captain Jinks, the Cobbler","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
