James Aubrey, the actor playing the father’s preferred suitor, may look like a Chaplin imitator, but he came by those skills honorably, born like Chaplin in Britain and likewise coming to the U.S. with Fred Karno’s troupe. Nevertheless it’s Alice Mann, with her wacky headdress and knowing glance, who steals the show. Suffice it to say that many vases are broken and pants ripped before she escapes out the window with the handsomest of the beaus.","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rips and Rushes","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
