Slightly crazy but more likely wise, the cynical homeless prophet initially rejects the good-natured dog, but eventually gives in, forming a bond sealed by her naming her one and only friend, Rascal. At a low point in her life, Sally gains renewed hope through unconditional love for Rascal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Sally Met Rascal...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
