Originated in parts of England, the myth of Jan Jedermann (\"John Everyman\") deals with a rich man on his deathbed coming to terms with his life's failures. Not following much of a plot, the modernized version involves famous fashion designer Jedermann (Klaus Maria Brandauer) imagining his last big gala event while rendered unconscious as a result of a car accident in his Ferrari. He is a success in Vienna but not in fashionable Paris, so he wishes to impress French elder stateswoman Yvonne Becker (Juliette Greco).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3CejRcJYKarjYq2duqMEi3qAtC4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10273,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmfonds Wien","origin_country":""},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":224,"logo_path":null,"name":"wega film vienna","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":264,"logo_path":"/fA90qwUKgPhMONqtwY60GaHRyrW.png","name":"Studio Babelsberg","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":11316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Production","origin_country":""},{"id":10946,"logo_path":"/gk4SFkJ3G49gGL308zymD8QGNw.png","name":"WDR/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":173,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everyman's Feast","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
