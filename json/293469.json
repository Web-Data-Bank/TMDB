The current protest movement in Turkey -originated to protect Gezi-park against demolition- is a movement against the ruling AK party. The ruthless dealings of the police against peaceful protesters sparked a nation-wide movement. Then something remarkable happened: fans of the competing football teams united for a common cause for the first time ever. The football ultras now fight side by side against the police and use their experience with clashes to help the protesters against tear gas and to build barricades. The name for their alliance: Istanbul United.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hk6Mld3KcYj96RmbOWj8oAetCT3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Istanbul United","title":"Istanbul United","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
