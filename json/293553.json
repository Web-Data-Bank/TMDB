The young man wallows in post-severed hand depression. Will criminality reign supreme? Will he live alone as a bitter one-handed man? Not if the slightly rotted hand, now alive and determined to exact revenge, teems up with his former body and a masked S&M gay superhero to rid the city of evil.","popularity":1.06,"poster_path":"/1i67kMcsiBOUn8cKrugBvhhtr5p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nobody has the right to not be offended.","title":"Bloody Knuckles","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5}
