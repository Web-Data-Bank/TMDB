Having signed what was ostensibly a new, 100 million dollar contract just a couple of years before, Prince was now demanding - not unreasonably to most commentators - control of his masters and the freedom to release what he wanted when he wanted. After a bitter war of words, during which the star scrawled Slave across his cheek whenever he appeared in public and routinely dissed his label, the parties finally settled and Prince henceforth was free to take full control of his music and the way it was sold to consumers. Prince approached this task with devastating foresight as he routinely created new marketing concepts which, with time, became the norm across the music world.","popularity":1.927,"poster_path":"/qWZdRxfOlsRv7aWSrgxQ7eJws3z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prism Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slave Trade: How Prince Remade the Music Business","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
