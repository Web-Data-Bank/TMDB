Only members of her fan club were allowed to attend the shows. She kicked off the small tour in Calgary, Alberta, and played for a crowd of around 200. The Calgary show aired on television on 2 April 2007, on the CBC Network. On this show, one could see behind-the-scenes footage and Lavigne performing songs from The Best Damn Thing, as well as other shows in Los Angeles, Paris and Madrid. She also held autograph signings in New York City and Hollywood after the album was released.  The tour stirred controversy when it generated protests in Malaysia over Lavigne being 'too sexy'.  However, the government finally gave permission for her to perform on 29 August 2008.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wxYz9Z6RAEEaAOpT8HUUOa8BqUO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avril Lavigne: Live in Calgary","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
