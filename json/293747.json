Having just won the hometown title of \"Miss Maple Syrup\", Hazel decides to move to Hollywood to be a star. Speedy cooks up a scheme to get her seen by important Hollywood producer, B.O. Botswaddle (Raymond Brown) who is known to never make a move without Astrological guidance. This scheme involves making up Patsy with turban and a 3rd Eye, and introducing her to Botswaddle as a mystical seer... one, of course, who see's Hazel as the star of his next motion picture. Naturally, things do not go as planned. Treen is especially memorable in a wonderfully goofy role.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qRtTAAisfIovroih6mzYPbgkP6y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Star Is Shorn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
