Music comes from everywhere. Edited almost thirty years apart, the two Chronicles together are a study in Auder's approach to his memories. The footage is all from the same trip that was a family vacation.  Considering Chronicles/Morocco, 1971 a construct of emotional convenience unfaithful to memory, Auder decided to supplement the first version with a fuller account. The two works feature almost entirely different footage. There are, however, sections where one can see where Auder has omitted Viva. The star of the 1971 version is a young Moroccan Adonis who appoints himself tour-guide for a group of Europeans including Michel. The camera follows his charming antics as he flaunts his nubile body and rather blunt but effective skills as a hunter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronicles: Morocco","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
