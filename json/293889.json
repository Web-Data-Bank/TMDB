And with James Levine’s wizardry galvanizing the marvelous all-star cast, this is truly a gem. Plácido Domingo is the legendary hero Aeneas, Jessye Norman the obsessed prophetess Cassandra, and Tatiana Troyanos is Queen Dido, who commits suicide when Aeneas leaves her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uqx22h1nfuvhGCY8vKqBri7O8EO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":250,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"MET OPENS 100TH SEASON WITH 'LES TROYENS'","title":"Berlioz: Les Troyens","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
