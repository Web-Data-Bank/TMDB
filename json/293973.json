The \"How to Ride a Horse\" sequence in The Reluctant Dragon (1941) set the pattern for many of these cartoons. An elegant narrator (artist John Ployardt) explains a sport that Goofy attempts to demonstrate. The character that animator Art Babbitt described in a 1935 lecture (quoted in the DVD bonus material) as an easygoing dimbulb gave way to an enthusiastic but spectacularly maladroit figure. One of the funniest entries in the series, \"Hockey Homicide,\" contains several studio in-jokes: dueling stars Icebox Bertino and Fearless Ferguson, and referee Clean-Game Kinney are named for artists Al Bertino, Norm Ferguson, and director Jack Kinney.","popularity":1.907,"poster_path":"/2otFZdBdVwoMD6BjOjjH0cgStwp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126540,"logo_path":"/eNwCQbBPAfDL8U4JUvBgyaKtth2.png","name":"Walt Disney Home Video","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2,"logo_path":"/wdrCwmRnLFJhEoH8GSfymY85KHT.png","name":"Walt Disney Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":326,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"His Greatest Misadventures","title":"Walt Disney Treasures - The Complete Goofy","video":true,"vote_average":9.7,"vote_count":3}
