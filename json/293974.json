Former soap star Tom doesn't take his job and his relationships very seriously. Niek on the other hand, is a workaholic, which recently led to a separation from his wife Karin. When the brothers are preparing for the busy holiday season, attractive Julia walks through the door with an offer they can't refuse: participating in a bold ad campaign that will rock Dutch holiday traditions to their core. Soon enough, Tom and Niek find themselves in a whirlwind of family issues, national cultural matters and love, after which neither of them will ever be the same.","popularity":0.832,"poster_path":"/yd9lGKqYrXhAE2BPwHer2df0X8Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8962,"logo_path":"/dNe4iMWCGaQRA6RTIYzUfqMigYh.png","name":"Eyeworks Film \u0026 TV Drama","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gift from the Heart","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":15}
