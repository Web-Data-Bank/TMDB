No actual footage was shot for the project, which instead consists entirely of outtakes, commercials, strips of undeveloped film, Academy leader, and other filmic castoff material, creating a seemingly endless stream of newsreel and stock footage. It was the longest film ever made at the time of its release, but has since been superseded by many other films.\"","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/f4rsLuhFdUTOuJegtngkSR5WWiW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1968-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":2880,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Longest Most Meaningless Movie in the World","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
