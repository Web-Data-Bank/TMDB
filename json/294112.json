These are the frayed ends of the city, sometimes dismal, sometimes downright snug, with wrecker's yards, horse meadows, caravan shelters and mobile fish and chips stands. Sometimes there are still some small green plots, but usually these pieces of Holland lie jammed between the advancing infrastructure, like railways, motorways or an airport runway. Ben van Lieshout searched these remarkable places and the people on these 'enclaves', as passers-by, inhabitants or self-employed persons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Locatie TusseNLand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
