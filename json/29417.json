Mark Adams (John Gabriel) is an FBI agent who has been assigned to infiltrate an organized crime ring that has obtained a set of printing plates that will allow them to produce nearly perfect counterfeit 20-dollar bills. The plates were made in Germany during World War II, and were discovered by a radical right-wing group hoping to restore the Nazi Party to power. The American gangsters are in cahoots with a group of wealthy American neo-Nazis sympathetic to the new German cause, led by fugitive war criminal Count von Delberg (Kent Taylor); the count has in turn recruited a vicious motorcycle gang, the Bloody Devils, to do his dirty work.","popularity":1.36,"poster_path":"/2X4bJCUX2vP4zbalZKDS3zGeHy6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent International Pictures (I-I)","origin_country":""},{"id":15237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Blasters","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":38474,"logo_path":"/wDtZ0YB3KOaVSNGQjoFOc20YPap.png","name":"Severin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Madmen on motorcycles!","title":"Hell's Bloody Devils","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":10}
