The friendship comes under pressure during a dance audition in Paris, where one clearly is superior to the other. A unique film with the passion for dance as a binder for an unusual friendship and countryside as surprisingly natural playing field. Set up by choreographer Mourad Merzouki, the founder of a hip-hop circus school, director of a dance academy and widely loved ambassador for the French streetdance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8HqQMxOAVeFH3SltMNw3Vgt4Lt5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20662,"logo_path":"/rxfxm2P7zJdUsXB9d5Zrg9DOXfd.png","name":"TV5 Monde","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1028,"logo_path":null,"name":"GMT Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ceux qui dansent sur la tête","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":6}
