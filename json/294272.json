To his daughter, Grace, who works as a forest ranger, these stories are little more than tall tales... until she meets Pete, a mysterious 10-year-old with no family and no home who claims to live in the woods with a giant, green dragon named Elliott. And from Pete's descriptions, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meacham's stories. With the help of Natalie, an 11-year-old girl whose father Jack owns the local lumber mill, Grace sets out to determine where Pete came from, where he belongs, and the truth about this dragon.","popularity":27.89,"poster_path":"/dhxv7oyy3UofmjZTxMXv3nCFLwF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whitaker Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-08-10","revenue":143695338,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some secrets are too big to keep.","title":"Pete's Dragon","video":false,"vote_average":6.377,"vote_count":2025}
