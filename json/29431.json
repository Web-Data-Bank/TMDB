On the surface, it seems like the perfect neighborhood. Everything you could possibly need is within walking distance. But...the pastoral exterior conceals a dark past and an even darker secret. As a group of individuals-each with their own ties and agendas with the town and each other-converges on the enclave, strange things begin to happen. Very strange things. Strange enough to test- and then break-the very fabric of reality itself.","popularity":2.047,"poster_path":"/A1Nb9cH9ccM18pLilANzcpAfqaI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22708,"logo_path":null,"name":"Incendiary Features","origin_country":""},{"id":22709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Upstart Filmworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You can't escape your past and you can't outrun yourself","title":"Psychic Experiment","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":4}
