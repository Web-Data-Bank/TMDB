A critical view of a society which survived the war, won its independence but still struggles with human equality. An insightful portrait of a Balkan village, of a patriarchal microcosm, and of its mayor who desperately wants to control the village life. Of husbands who feel forced to behave strong, but act against their own emotional interest. A reflection of rituals which not only show gender inequality, but also the absence of freedom of expression within the male community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2Enlmk5heBkaSZJ6vcovXSYXEDp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22028,"logo_path":"/sL5udH4n7YbCuHJ4XxUyliWTJw9.png","name":"NiKo Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":68351,"logo_path":"/5iI8qbtcBoiklodCyJb0Srvllma.png","name":"ISSTRA Creative Factory","origin_country":"XK"},{"id":68352,"logo_path":null,"name":"CMB Productions","origin_country":"XK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Windows and a Hanging","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
