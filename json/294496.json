Malka, a whore with a Romanian accent who dreams of becoming a singer, Levi, her pimp and Moshe, a homeless man who dreams that Malka will love him and follows Malka and Levi. Levi navigates the trio in a grotesque and turbulent world in which people have lost the purpose of their existence. The result is a black comedy that combines the elements of the film \"Bourekas\" with poetic enlightening moments, all in the special, confident and blatant style of Assi Dayan.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/wzUjG3pAtwhxCjoTz8cFLxHRBJw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Electric Blanket Named Moshe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
