Her apparent \"normalcy,\" however, makes her something of a misfit in her family, made up as it is by a group of outrageous performers. Audrey's parents were funk/ R& B stars in the 1970s, while her brother currently reigns supreme on the hip hop and fashion scene, and her precocious little sister is a streetsmart MC in the manner of Lil' Kim. Audrey finds this family tree a little embarrassing, and is somewhat disdainful of the ego and trappings of pop culture entertainment, so she hides her clan from her new boyfriend. This unfortunately becomes a bit difficult to maintain when the family shows up for a visit. The campus will never be the same again!","popularity":1.255,"poster_path":"/r7nDJ3V2C6zW7EQvJJDneNN3FmZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Breakaway Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-03-08","revenue":1000000,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They put the 'Dis' in Dysfunctional!","title":"My Big Phat Hip Hop Family","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
