There is widespread agreement that America needs to wean itself off oil yet Ethanol has become a lightning rod of controversy.

Debate rages on the pros and cons of Ethanol but what is the truth? -  Ed Begley Jr., Tracy Mork, Jason Mraz","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
