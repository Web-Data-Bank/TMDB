Struggling to reconcile the evidence with his once held religious views, Peter turns to his uncle, Josh Sanders, a retired scientist and a man of strong Christian faith. Meanwhile, Sarah Pennington seeks protection for her young daughter, Kara, believing the extraterrestrials are bent on abducting the gifted nine-year-old as they did Sarah's husband three years earlier. When the four are brought together by Ethan, a mysterious stranger, Peter and Sarah wrestle with their own beliefs as Josh seeks to convince them of the truth. It becomes clear that Kara has a very special gift-one that can expose the true nature of the extraterrestrials.","popularity":1.16,"poster_path":"/pWVJJxGTG3fyowJzPb3vIc99f4A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Watchers: Revelation","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
