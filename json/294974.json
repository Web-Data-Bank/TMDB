After 61 years of hegemony by the Colorado Party and by the dictator Stroessner, this unexpected victory came as a political miracle. But politics is not for saints and the dream turns into a nightmare. Power and Impotence tells the utopia of political change: the adventure of common men accessing power to try and challenge the system from within. In a political thriller settled in stranger-than-fiction Paraguay, we follow their hopes and disappointments from a unique behind-the-scene point of view, until the tragic ending. An uncommon film, an authentic modern Shakespearean drama about power.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Power and Impotence, a drama in 3 acts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
