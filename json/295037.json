Pam, Tommy and Tammy are all played by Trecartin, who, wearing his signature make-up, jumps back and forth between male and female roles. Totally self-absorbed and equipped with vestigial attention spans, the characters are constantly communicating with one another on the phone or online.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zBVNUETzfaZxgLcYKBWQ95hXTO8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Arts Intermix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(Tommy-Chat Just E-mailed Me.)","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
