The film traces his imagery, listens for his whispers and infiltrates the memories of his closest friends, looking for clues in order to piece together the portrait of a filmmaker who made something out of nothing and stayed true to himself and his vision until the very end.  Besides Tornes' own films, this documentary includes footage from films where the \"poor hunter\" appeared as an actor, like \"The Secret of the Red Cloak\" by Kostas Fotinos, \"Kierion\" by Dimos Theos and \" Allonsanfan\" by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stavros Tornes: The Poor Hunter of the South","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
