In this world a new species has evolved through the children who survived, breathing and living underwater as they did in the womb. The constellation of historical and present day episodes within the essay explores the relationship between finance, death, abstraction and language.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4ixqIlypwVHvcbQqZac8XBPoyI5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56986,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Otolith Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hydra Decapita","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
