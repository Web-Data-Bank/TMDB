The world was told it was a suicide, but evidence would lead many people to believe it might be otherwise. The film investigates the possibilities that exist that Kurt Cobain's death might not have been a suicide, that the Seattle Police Department rushed their verdict, and the global media perpetuated lies and misinformation fed to them by Courtney Love that created the belief in many that Cobain killed himself—but when revealed to be lies—lead many to now question what happened.","popularity":6.689,"poster_path":"/1ScpSMDQvwi28Dro1xwSOcKCVln.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valiant","origin_country":""},{"id":42373,"logo_path":null,"name":"DareDevil Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The death of an icon comes to life","title":"Soaked in Bleach","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":159}
