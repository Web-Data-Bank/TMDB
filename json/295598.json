Her quick and meteoric rise to an undefeated world champion took not only the boxing world by surprise, but sent emotions fever pitch. But whilst the global press rushed to portray her as a strong and confident woman tagged »Zambia’s Million Dollar Baby», in private Esther slowly crumbled under the weight of her success.  Adulation and celebrity had increased, but so had criticism, envy and expectations from her family and fans. In the pursuit of independence from a husband, her global success had made her a symbol of hope and empowerment, and a provider for her family and friends whose demands increased as Esther’s fortune grew.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4ZK4wq1KoGuYxCzIP5rJFJwkKmH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Outline Pictures","origin_country":"ZM"},{"id":34244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Helmi Films","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZM","name":"Zambia"}],"release_date":"2014-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Rings","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
