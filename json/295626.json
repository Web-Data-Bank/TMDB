The very young Zdena (Marta Vancurová), too, dreams about a white veil and an entourage of bridesmaids. On her return home from work, she runs into a peculiar man on an abandoned road who pertinaciously offers to read her palm for a few crowns to buy soup. His augury is rather usual - wealth and poverty, suffering and happiness. Then however, he declares that Zdena must marry exactly on 3 November of that year otherwise she will be unhappy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1931,"logo_path":"/5erHhgvym2cTORao8ajtn2gbiTH.png","name":"Filmové studio Barrandov","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1970-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nevěsta","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
