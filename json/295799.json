More than a fashion film, the documentary is a story about creativity and how, even in Iris’ dotage, a soaring free spirit continues to inspire. IRIS portrays a singular woman whose enthusiasm for fashion, art and people are life’s sustenance and reminds us that dressing, and indeed life, is nothing but an experiment.","popularity":4.824,"poster_path":"/wu51mndv09RaK5Z3vQPQMjaDtB5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iris","video":false,"vote_average":7.361,"vote_count":97}
