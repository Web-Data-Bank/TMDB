Men die and are crippled in combat by firefights and booby traps, soldiers kill and capture the enemy, gather intelligence and retake ground only to cede it again whilst battling against the bureaucracy and obstinacy of the conventional military hierarchy. In the end they return to civilization, forever changed by their experiences but glad to return to the life they once knew.","popularity":3.116,"poster_path":"/bGpuE1qC9xkwVOCB4tF4L1M3Nd9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14590,"logo_path":null,"name":"New South Wales Film Corp.","origin_country":""},{"id":417,"logo_path":"/w7d3hoHQaC0XwjrxEG1yPeuUhu5.png","name":"Australian Film Commission","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":186006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Samson Productions Pty.
