When she leaves the group to pursue a career as a film actress, he gives her a small figure as a keepsake, a symbol of traditional theatre. He tells her to return it only when she is certain she wants to stay in film. The dancer’s independence in choosing to become a film actress breaks with cultural tradition, as does Sein Lin’s performance in a jazz club, symbolising the colonial influence. Winner of Best Director at the Burmese Academy Awards in 1971.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yHeXTBeO1DtZxWyVZ6F6y2M6cvN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118175,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pan Wai Wai Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tender are the Feet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
