Director and author Thomas Kronthaler packages a fine morality about money, family ties and charity with a black sense of humor and a sense of subtle punchlines. In addition to Saskia Vester and Heinz-Josef Braun, who is mainly known through the films of Marcus H. Rosenm√ºller, shines not least the multi-award winning Gertrud Roll as a clever senior.","popularity":1.124,"poster_path":"/b12rqasIVepmQh1fiz05vJJfMWQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61101,"logo_path":null,"name":"d.i.e. Film GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schluss!
