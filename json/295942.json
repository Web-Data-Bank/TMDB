They target them to keep their seed only after marriage with a female for the purpose of fertilization. \"Sacred Sperm\" penetrates into one of the most suppressed hidden issues in the Orthodox Hasidic Jewish Community - a Taboo. Throughout the film we follow the emotional and theological struggle of the director who is trying to find a proper way as a father to explain his teenager son logically why he should keep this major Mitzvah (commandment) which perceived by many as unreasonable and seems impossible to fulfill.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mgWrNBdLoElMTHPrnHzVFMCCI5L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2014-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An eye-opening documentary explaining the concept of ‘sacred sperm’ within the ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jewish community.","title":"Sacred Sperm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
