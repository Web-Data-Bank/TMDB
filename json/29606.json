Despite critical and popular acclaim, the band was short-lived with only one album and a brief 1969 tour that debuted July 12 at Madison Square Garden and ended August 24 in Hawaii. Since then, Winwood and Clapton have remained friends but have only performed together a few times over the years for an occasional song at a charity event. The 2008 Madison Square Garden shows were the first full Winwood-Clapton concerts in almost 40 years.","popularity":2.121,"poster_path":"/tC2UC2sfL31nX28Bktfx1rj8cHs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reprise Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":197,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood: Live from Madison Square Garden","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
