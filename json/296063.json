On the discovery that Ming was a 500-pound pound Tiger and Al a seven-foot alligator, their story took on an astonishing dimension. The film frames Yates’s recollections with a poetic study of Ming and Al, the predators’ presence combined with a text by philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, reimagining the circumstances of the wild inside, animal names, strange territories, and human-animal relations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e7AuynO7kXt7FiFx4CBWz3UNXZZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ming of Harlem: Twenty One Storeys in the Air","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":6}
