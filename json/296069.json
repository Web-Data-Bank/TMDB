The approach is formalistic and optically printed material is used throughout. The drama of the nuclear family is played by a series of non-human subjects - ranging from mannequins used in 1950s nuclear blast experiments, to doves playing ping-pong. The notion of family is experienced as iconic, nostalgic and a recollected remnant of the nuclear age.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuclear Family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
