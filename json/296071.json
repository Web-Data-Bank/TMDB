Her tepid life as a jobless illustrator comes complete with roommates who harbor diehard hobbies that solidify their status as hopeless social rejects. These wallflowers run a tight, nun-like ship, but their no-men-allowed-not-no-one-not-no-how bubble is unwittingly burst after Tsukimi brings home a rescued sea jelly and a beauty queen... who's actually a guy. When the threat of losing their cozy convent inspires this glamour boy to turn the neurotic entourage into a portrait of success, will Tsukimi take her chance to bloom, or will she end up a hot mess?","popularity":2.559,"poster_path":"/l7A1ZtUcaOfPGUkTSjflu5yzw02.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59118,"logo_path":"/9nTCEBgGaaI5swkv8gy2vny0Mb5.png","name":"Kodansha","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Princess Jellyfish","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":17}
