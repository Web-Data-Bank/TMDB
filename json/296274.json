It pays homage to the diaspora of the different waves of migration, and challenges the way we represent our narratives. It is a search for a renewed consciousness, for reinvention, a \"what if\", the formal equivalent of asking a question expressed with a broken tongue - or not so broken after all. Mainly made with images from the January 1st issues of \"The New York Times\" since its beginning in 1851 to 2013, Broken Tongue is a heartfelt tribute to avant-garde sound performer Tracie Morris and to her poem \"Afrika\". \" - Mónica Savirón","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Tongue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
