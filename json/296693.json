Riversâ€™ films are, typically, intimate portrayals of solitary beings or isolated communities. In Things however, he turns his attention to the unexplored objects, thoughts and memories from inside his own home.  The film is a collision of individual fragments of video and sound, which together complete an abstract, humorous and intimate picture.  In the Summer section for example, we witness a squirrel attacking a coconut model of another squirrel. In its attention to small moments, the film is a rumination of the things we gather around us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
