And if you thought that richly inventive spoof of the leering macho in God?s Little Acre, the crowded waiting room of your local railway station, was one of the luniest Erotic Tales ever made, then buckle your seat belt for a ride down Life?s Great Battlefield: the expressway during rush hour!

A layover at the next gas station.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/avnZuJbJKA5N9oPRgz7Ti6VfcR8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gas Station","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
