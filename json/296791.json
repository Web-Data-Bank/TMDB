Filmed in Athens and Peloponnesus in Greece as well as in Austria, much of Sotiros is structured around another binarism: two repeating intertitles marked \"He said\" and \"he said.\" Each title introduces a set of visual phrases with loosely parallel camerawork. The images are careful and delicate studies of light patterns in a hotel suite and at a cafe, rolling hills populated by a lone shepherd, Eurostyle modernized storefronts, a blind man begging in the street. The filmâ€™s title refers to one of the appellations of the Apollo, in his role as savior or healer. - New York Press","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ajc7BuLkMxNFpv5iafNvUEV9XLa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2000-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sotiros","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
