An accident, everyone says. But the autopsy shows that Ralf Kossak was killed. The police consider Stefan Hansen, the father of the dead Lisa, for the murderer, because he has the strongest motive: revenge. But Hansen was not, his wife Meike not. In the village begins a veritable witch hunt on Kossak's widow and her sons. The police discover what a shattering drama is in the Kossak family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k7zPSgGfyAWiTR8tMbFVdGb22yi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death on the Baltic","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
