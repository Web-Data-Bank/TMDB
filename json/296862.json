Silvestre Pantaleón follows the protagonist as he struggles to pay for a curing ceremony and provide for his family. He dedicates himself to the only remunerative activities he knows: handcrafting rope for religious ceremonies and building seldom-used household objects that he alone still has the skills to produce. Silvestre Pantaleón is a simple, though universal, tale of aging, told with a lyrical combination of lingering imagery and quotidian detail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xJ2ertMSw3cXgNOvLk7k3BHqZ8g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silvestre Pantaleón","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
