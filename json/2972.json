Sculpted of clay and animated by the mysterious secrets of the Cabala, the Golem was a seemingly indestructible juggernaut, performing acts of great heroism, yet equally capable of dreadful violence.  When the rabbi's assistant takes control of the Golem and attempts to use him for selfish gain, the lumbering monster runs rampant, abducting the rabbi's daughter and setting fire to the ghetto.","popularity":8.246,"poster_path":"/7zdqM0MgZBfy3tuJdNO4cWAGBtj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions A-G Union (PAGU)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1920-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golem: How He Came into the World","video":false,"vote_average":7.018,"vote_count":169}
