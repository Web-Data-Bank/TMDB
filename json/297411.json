An auto breakdown after a party places her in a compromising situation, and she grudgingly marries a wealthy suitor of her father's choice. When her husband's cruelty results in the death of her child, she leaves him and meets Ramon, an architect with whom she becomes infatuated. The return of his former mistress causes her to seek refuge with her cousin Judith, where she falls in love with Douglas, Judith's sweetheart. As Sandy refuses to return to Ramon, he shoots her and then kills himself. Douglas, taking the blame for her sake, is tried for murder, but Sandy rises from her sickbed and confesses in court; she succumbs after restoring Judith to Douglas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6CO722pHXOmyQvOp81WcBPC38g7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"She defied Life's Conventions in her search for Thrills","title":"Sandy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
