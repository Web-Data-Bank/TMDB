In The Brain That Changes Itself, Dr Norman Doidge explores the profound implications of the changing brain in a way that will permanently alter the way we look at human possibility and human nature.  The documentary examines a blind man who sinks a basketball; a woman with half a brain who leads a normal life; learning disorders, strokes and brain traumas that are improved and cured; and chronic pain that is alleviated. The vast expanse of the brain's possibility is still unrealized.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l5qeUnONHUN5ckCntIUICUNId26.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Brain That Changes Itself","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
