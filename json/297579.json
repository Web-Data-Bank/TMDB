Burne-Jones plays matchmaker for a young British nobleman who has fallen in love with a servant girl on his estate. The artist shows that love can thrive between members of different classes by depicting on canvas a picture from Tennyson's poem about the love of King Cophetua for a beggar maid. As he relates the story of the poem in words and through his painting, the young earl sees the application to his own situation.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/vcGQ6LESf4o1Sw3i1yiyGIoqWv5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35356,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triart Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beggar Maid","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1}
