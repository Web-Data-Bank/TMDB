A place steeped in history and legend; Gods and spiritual guides; untold wealth â€“ and the bone-cracking, blood-spilling guardians of its riches.  Jack Wells has arrived in Egypt in search of the famous diamond known as The Codex Stone. His journey leads him to the tomb of the cursed King Neferu, cursed not by name but by nature.
