An intimate perspective on the daily lives and emotions of their fellow refugees, REQUIEM is also a poignant reminder of the civilian toll and trauma of 21st Century wars and an alarm sounded against indifference to the suffering and courage of millions, a non-partisan call for humanity and compassion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rXYeOhiVT7QML1Pkn4EDv8cUgT6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Requiem for Syrian Refugees","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
