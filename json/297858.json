Emily Wardill’s delicate narrative of interconnections explores the mysterious relationship of mind and body. Neuroscientist Dominique is treating Simon, who suffers from the loss of his proprioception – his sense of the relative position of his body parts. Her daughter Tony is a synchronised swimmer, perfectly in control of her own body as a way of running away from her mind. Dominique met her lover Hugo on a dating website. He claims to be a US spy. Is it a lie or his fantasy? From different perspectives, all these figures exemplify an interior alienation that distorts their cognition of their respective worlds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When You Fall Into a Trance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
