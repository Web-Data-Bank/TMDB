On an Internet dating site she writes: 'I'm looking for people who would like to be photographed in public revealing something of themselves...' What I'm Looking For, a 15-minute high definition video, documents this adventure; the connections formed at this intersection between virtual and actual public space. The video is a rumination on the nature of photography and the persistence of vision. It is a short tale of desire and control.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32040,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York State Council on the Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":35548,"logo_path":null,"name":"House Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What I'm Looking For","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
