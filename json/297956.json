He likes to hang around in the park, listen to music, play videogames and dance as much as possible. Preferably with his dance partner Roxanne. But almost nobody, especially not Roxanne, knows he has a metabolic disease that could end his life. Despite the concerns of his parent, Maarten wants to live life to the fullest.
