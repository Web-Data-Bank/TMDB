And while Hammer may be best-known for their notorious series of gory Dracula movies, bloody Frankenstein adventures and chilling, satanic epics, few films had a greater impact on the '60's than the unforgettable genre known as \"Hammer Glamours.\"  The \"Hammer Glamour\" epics delivered their own singular vision of history -- and especially pre-history -- with liberal doses of both flesh and fantasy.  With special effects as eye-popping as the actresses, these films created puberty's essential bridge between the thrill of cool monsters and the sensation of gorgeous women.  If you're a student of anthropology, this is a world you may not recognize.  But if you're looking for a twisted vision of the past that only Hammer can provide, you've come to the right place.  The Hammer Glamour legacy lives, and indeed the world has never been the same.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/q0uNcBqcvChPSabN2UnQ6VA6YoY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anchor Bay Home Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":1314,"logo_path":"/gQBluDqe6dc2ZdzfJbabEHoSGoG.png","name":"Hammer Film Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World of Hammer: Lands Before Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
