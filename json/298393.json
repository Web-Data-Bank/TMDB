A couple of entertaining interviews, a photo gallery, and a short (and, sadly, very poorly narrated) documentary on the band's history complete the portrait.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hMO6BQnXMjCGPCTrBDTlkkJlO1f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Music Colombia","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":344,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1977-1982 The Complete Jam on Film","title":"The Complete Jam","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
