Its a great cheerless environment; life is arduous and dangerous; conditions at the plant are nearly subhuman. The only excitement in the grimy industrial town is provided by robbing a train at gunpoint or stealing sheep from the Bashkiri tribe.

Against his better judgment, but with the support of his co-workers, Ignat decides to take part in this perilous venture.","popularity":0.857,"poster_path":"/uOL5GJoRa2L5wm95pKuY7W70Via.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170585,"logo_path":"/1nUzkMSbZOzoYgHHhBSJ5xGwnIm.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1993-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Iron Gods","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6}
