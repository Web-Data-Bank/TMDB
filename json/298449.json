Clark Kant is a mild-mannered Christian teenager with a super secret. Through light-hearted humor, the Super Christian series sets out to teach us something about Christian growth. In the first installment [sic] of Super Christian, we find that Clark Kant lives in two different worlds. During the week, Clark follows the standards of the world. \"Why not?\" he asks himself. \"Isn't everybody doing it?\" But on Sunday, in his Super Christian Best, Clark presents quite a different image. Then Clark learns through a friend that the Christian faith is for every day of the week, not just for Sundays.
