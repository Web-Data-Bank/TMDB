One option presents itself in the form of Darren, a rather vociferous and iron-willed, gay British man who shares the couple's need for a child and clocks in as a strong candidate for sperm donor. The three consult with attorneys on the legal stipulations, then agree to move forward. Fiona's insemination passes without a hitch, but as the pregnancy rolls on, tempers begin to flare and open hostility erupts, raising serious questions about the emotional fortitude of this situation -- particularly the question of whether the baby is a strong enough force to bind everyone together and pull them through the tumult unscathed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9XUaA9hwRrwzSjDX0BtI2CddyWL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 Mums and a Dad","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
