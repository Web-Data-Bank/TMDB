Fabia Mirassos projects her life through the role of Meg, a transsexual hairdresser confronting intolerance and re-living memories of abuse. Savana 'Bibi' Meirelles plays Zilda who makes her living as one of the many transgendered sex workers in São Paulo, as she struggles to find her way out of prostitution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9e7Netw7kzsSXdCpaJn6DMbDOMn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Transgender ethnofiction ethnographical","title":"Transfiction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
