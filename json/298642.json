One get's the idea that he would like to knock her over the head with a club and drag her to his cave but since this is out of fashion he decides to stalk her and annoy her heavy-handedly into a full submission. Understandingly, she instantly dislikes the lad and tries to shake him off. She succeeds a few times but then starts to suffer from some kind of Stockholm syndrome and falls for him. But that's not enough for him, being an infantile egoist he wants to tame the \"wild bird\" fully and break every last bit of her own will. It's all hard to believe if you haven't seen it yourself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i6JxLqwE2BKzqEcuXwl7pwjm3Gr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berlin-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1943-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wildvogel","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
