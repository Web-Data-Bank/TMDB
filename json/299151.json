When his 80s-inspired lifestyle results in him being the laughing stock of his small town, Rick sets out to fulfill his late father's wish to attend Rocklahoma, an 80s-themed music festival in the United States.  Getting there proves to be much more difficult than Rick imagined; shady club owners, untrustworthy friends, and a lack of money threaten to crush Rick's dreams, and leave him forever stranded in a town that ostracizes him for being different. To reach Rocklahoma, Rick will be forced to make the most important and potentially heartbreaking decision of his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":36404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Acro-Kolepsi Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":36405,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bagman Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A 100% Canadian independent production that celebrates the tumultuous decade of the 1980s.","title":"Destination: Rad City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
