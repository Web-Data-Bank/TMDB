Follow the lives of Benjamin, Caleb, Sarah, Joel, Leah, and Nathan, living in Jerusalem about 30 A.D. They hear stories of the Man from Nazareth who heals the sick and raises the dead. They struggle to make sense of it all - some from families who believe Jesus is the Son of God, others from families who do not. They watch Jesus from the crowds. They follow Him to see what this incredible Man, who loves children, will do next. They see Him betrayed, wrongly accused, crucified and buried. But they remember the promise of Jesus and believe they will see Him again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c5mmgnQqgehtswsUc96fNHGtUKX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Jesus Through the Eyes of Children","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
