In this imagined (perhaps dreamed?) location, peculiar habits respond to the needs of a peculiar environment. Roger, a fragile gay man, and his female companions, trying to cope with the absence of their husbands, go through their own brand of challenges for survival, with their own form of outdoor camaraderie, thought-occupying chat and DIY activities. Roger has a tough daughter who runs him ragged, but he has buddies willing to help: Justine, Denise, Pamela and Claudia-Joy.","popularity":1.235,"poster_path":"/rBk1os7Iq16lxmQpibuED3DKMCA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26371,"logo_path":null,"name":"My New Picture","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":36496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Bal","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":36497,"logo_path":null,"name":"Godolphin Films","origin_country":"TN"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fort Buchanan","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":9}
