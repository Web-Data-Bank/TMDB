As a recording artist, he's released dozens of singles, seven albums and four mix collections. As a producer, he's remixed tracks for artists such as Beck, Depeche Mode, Plastikman, Senor Coconut and the KLF. And as a DJ, he's manned the decks at some of the world's leading electronic music festivals and is known for his intelligent, broadly eclectic style. Filmmaker Romuald Karmakar, who had directed two feature-length documentaries on the history and culture of electronic music, offers a profile of one of the genre's leading artists with Villalobos. Rather than just creating a biographical sketch or a performance film, Karmakar attempts to give viewers an insight into Villalobos's creative process, his philosophy towards his music and his work, how his background has informed his art, and how his interaction with the audience informs his selections during a DJ set in unexpected ways.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h0P9b3GA2DUmzyzLsYVhgBOW7Cs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pantera Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Villalobos","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
