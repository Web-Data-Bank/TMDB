But he is saved from desperation by reading an autobiographical book and meeting its author, a deaf and blind lady of his own age. (2) Fatty, a security guard in his fifties, lives for two things: good food and love for a pretty executive living in his block of flats. But, if it is easy to satisfy his first need winning the heart of the distant belle is a horse of another color. (3) Two teenage schoolgirls get to know each other on the Internet. Soon they fall in love.","popularity":2.085,"poster_path":"/sP2Dmq7pANMhPxl8fbl04fxQHYH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17364,"logo_path":"/kUTBCXR72FgYSfL6kbOAETlnpAr.png","name":"Infinite Frameworks","origin_country":"SG"},{"id":17365,"logo_path":"/xxgzyEjYEVPkL8KiMhvYOVmCfAU.png","name":"Zhao Wei Films","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2005-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be with Me","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":28}
