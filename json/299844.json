Roy Orbison may not have had the gyrating hips of Elvis to make the crowds go wild, by what he did possess was a voice so uncannily emotional and honest that his audience would sit in total silence, savoring every note and hanging on every word, While Roy's formidable songwriting skills could make virtually any singer sound good, when applied to his beautifully peculiar pipes, his creations simply soared. Featuring his timeless classics \"Only the Lonely,\" \"You Got It,\" \"Crying,\" \"Pretty Woman\" and many more, this is Roy Orbison at his absolute finest. With special guest appearances by k.d. lang, Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne, and many more!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qN7DAcVdiiJwdLnSPjvL9aNgjBQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eagle Vision USA","origin_country":"US"},{"id":143792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orbison Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roy Orbison: Greatest Hits","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
