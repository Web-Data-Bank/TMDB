Tracing the origins of his work, American painter Fonseca reveals that his singular forms are not merely summoned from the imagination, but are also inherited from a deep and personal lineage of artists. Through his humor and self-examination, Fonseca shows us that colors and forms can reveal a man's history and character, reminding us that the work of an artist is not simply a reflection of life, but the essence of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painter: Caio Fonseca","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
