Veteran producers Darrell Miller and Ryan Halverson have brought to the table a deliciously tasty offering of big mountain lines and powdery entertainment. The Storm Show crew is back at it and going bigger than ever, bringing you more hard-hitting, action-packed, gnar-shredding from the Jackson Hole backcountry and beyond. Frosty Flakes is raw and real, top-level skiing and riding at its finest, biting off big-mountain lines before most people get up for work! Highlights include unbelievably deep Jackson Hole powder days, snowboarder Jason Elms & crew ripping sky-high lines 20-miles deep in the Wyoming backcountry, skier Derek Depiero’s comeback after a nasty skydiving accident, and newcomer Shin Bayajima showing us how it’s done with with wicked fast riding in no-fall zones.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6JBEvbfPSzZWvfCRdQ960Q9T5dd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Storm Show Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":168058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Full Room Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frosty Flakes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
