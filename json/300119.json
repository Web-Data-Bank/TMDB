We hear the man's disputatious monologue on the soundtrack: “I’m not the kind of guy to end up in a slime pit… I can’t understand it, see?” Baillie, an established master of 16mm cinematography, uses the video medium to search the man's confined space for rustling movements and leaking colors. Chet Baker sings “There Will Never Be Another You” as the filmmaker bids the pilot a peaceful adieu.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oaZ0xFOQ3WIUfYyehV6LAGO6Wx3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The P-38 Pilot","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
