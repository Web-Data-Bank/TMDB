The writing never quite builds up any steam, and many of the jokes were recycled from previous films anyhow.  This special was filmed in black and white -- strangely, since the previous one was in color. I generally love the look of black and white, and the earliest films in the Carry On series do fine with it. But here it is used ineffectively and feels like a budgetary concession, which I'm sure it was.","popularity":0.734,"poster_path":"/1wTyrcFwqTb6LuHiID0OoN00B91.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5846,"logo_path":"/xjhNN5Vz8LcRMtoodiRkZIU4bwa.png","name":"Thames Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1970-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carry on Again Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
