Scenes from the lives of several of them are portrayed in the film In Silence (ballet dancer Alice Flachová, pianist and conductor Karol Ebert, composer, conductor and director of the Dresden Theatre Arthur Chitz, pianist Edith Kraus, and the vocal ensemble Comedian Harmonists), which draws a sharp contrast between the protagonists’ carefree existence working and making music during the pre-war era and the subsequent severe upheaval in their lives brought on by the proliferation of nazism.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/vSGLD3oVyidBgbCm0HllV9LWUGB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24023,"logo_path":"/yz6m1ty4qGvlkfReuqPZxdmD8V2.png","name":"RTVS","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":33214,"logo_path":null,"name":"i/o post","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":37157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slovenský filmový ústav","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":37158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Furia Film","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":109070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmpark Production","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2014-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Silence","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3}
