He is married to Maggie, but his marriage is in trouble. He cannot stop thinking about other women in his life, characters he invents conversations with. He is constantly talking to: his deceased wife Julie, his daughter Molly, his sister Karen, and his psychiatrist Edith. All he does is have imaginary conversations with real people that are at the moment out of his life. Maggie cannot stand his mind wandering off all the time and decides to separate for six months and at the end of six months they will decide whether or not to remain together. Jake has a few girl friends, but spends the six months, while waiting for Maggie, only talking to these imaginary people, and a few times to real people.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4056,"logo_path":"/dnz7zZ2e11usyjPG3mTYvJfyciD.png","name":"Hallmark Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":20358,"logo_path":"/jPZ0jwLGGELbSxKoUrJzOytNpnp.png","name":"RHI Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jake's Women","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
