Tell the wrong joke in Singapore or United Arab Emirates and risk being handcuffed before you ever leave the stage. Bring Achmed the Dead Terrorist on stage in Malaysia after a government warning forbidding his presence, and you may never leave Kuala Lumpur. While Dunham crafts pop culture references that can excite a local audience upon entering each country, Jeff shows that humor is truly universal. Most of the time.","popularity":2.249,"poster_path":"/9o97CIpO5FgNXBYoXYxfgoV4lrz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Wire Blue Wire","origin_country":""},{"id":2922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Levity Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeff Dunham: All Over the Map","video":false,"vote_average":5.906,"vote_count":16}
