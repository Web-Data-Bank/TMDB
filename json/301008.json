Combining archive and contemporary footage - including that of the royal visit to Canada and the US in 1976, the bicentenary year of American independence - the film explores the monarchy through a quarter-century which saw the conquest of Everest, the development of television as a mass medium, the first supersonic flight and space exploration.  Through good times and bad, and tumultuous changes for better or for worse, one factor remained constant: the monarchy, in the person of Queen Elizabeth II, provided a continuity and stability which this film celebrates in her Silver Jubilee year.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9P9yZgDKFm6SD9bqCyaZBu1V5Ca.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":538,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMI Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1977-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"25 Years","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
