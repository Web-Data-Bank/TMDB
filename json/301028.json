As the title suggests, it takes its basic narrative from the myth of Orpheus, and his courageous but ill-fated attempt to rescue his lover Eurydice (also known as Eurydike) from the jaws of the underworld. This particular production finds Yann Bridard dancing as Orpheus and Marie-Agnès Gillot dancing as Eurydike , with mezzo-soprano Maria-Riccarda Wesseling accompanying Bridard and soprano Julia Kleiter accompanying Wesseling. Pina Bausch did the choreography and stage direction, while Rolf Borzik designed the sets, costumes and lighting. The Balthasar-Neumann Ensemble & Choir, under the direction of Thomas Hengelbrock, lend musical accompaniment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s2TnRG2ybuRtUVGl22VxgYafkMi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15790,"logo_path":null,"name":"BelAir Media","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orpheus and Eurydice","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
