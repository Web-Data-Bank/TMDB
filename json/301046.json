This observational documentary loosely follows the rhythm of the restaurant’s day, which swings between boredom and frenzy as the old rooms empty and fill. No one who works at John’s is actually Italian, but some have been here for 40 years, including two pairs of brothers and a father and son. JOHN’S OF 12TH STREET catalogues the overlooked details of working life and a vanishing facet of New York City.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":107116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grand Motel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In a rapidly changing New York City, century-old restaurant John's of 12th Street still dishes up classic Italian-American food and attracts eccentric clientele.
