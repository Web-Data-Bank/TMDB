He finds himself in his village, already in independent Ukraine. On the radio is heard a voice of the first president, who promises Ukrainians the right to a dignified life, and young people in clubs \"dance non-Moscow, independent rock 'n' roll\". The young man is trying to fit into a new picture of the world, even starting a relationship with a Latvian girl. The smell of freedom and international friendship wafts through the air. Dreamy and full of hope for a new life, Yuras is returned to earth by the executive service of the police, which acts as a long-standing and well-established repressive mechanism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/PQAkllaBc7w1pVqVSV7BIIGnOn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152691,"logo_path":"/xmKzksknmaAuXhdWtL4UVYKg1dh.png","name":"Dovzhenko Film Studio","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"1992-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dandelions' Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
