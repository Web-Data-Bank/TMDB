Much of his work takes on a fine art nature and includes landscapes, cityscapes, and other locations around the world. Some of this work has been chronicled in the short film Sojourns. Sojourns is a non-narrative 4K UHD feature chronicling locations and people all over the world, or at least as far as Mark has traveled. Sojourns is photographed entirely with Red cameras and shot in 4K and 5K resolutions which produce stunning detail and colors that beg to be examined up close, preferably with 4K UHD televisions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5BgcWJ7o7JU1zUMsEudvxxjLEvm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sojourns","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
