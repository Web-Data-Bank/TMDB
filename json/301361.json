The film, which features an unique overall vision incorporating both super 8mm film and digital video, follows a group of dynamic characters as they struggle with what it means to love, and to be loved. Unapologetic and unforgettably wild in its approach to combining Shakespeare and cinema, LOVE: AS YOU LIKE IT is simply not to be missed. This is not Shakespeare at its finest; this is Shakespeare the way its meant to be - bold, brave and brassy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j6gF2h7hqxtWKxfZBH5iEczSJNP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LOVE: As You Like It","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
