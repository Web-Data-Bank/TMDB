In this holy place, they take time to rest and appreciate the beauty of their surroundings, as the interior of the building is lined with ornate works of art. A group of Nazi soldiers eventually disrupts this moment of peace, as they enter the church and defile the sacred works within. Undetected, the original occupants witness this atrocity and the proud Russian feels compelled to fight in an effort to preserve his country’s history.","popularity":0.967,"poster_path":"/hVfPkaygTyuZ2rN0k6C3kfQwQPG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1970-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Quiet Day at the End of the War","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":10}
