The Endless River has as its starting point the music that came from the 1993 Division Bell sessions, when David Gilmour, Rick Wright and Nick Mason played freely together at Britannia Row and Astoria studios.

Those sessions resulted in The Division Bell, the band’s last studio album.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7SSRo7RxkFwuxRswwvOCtAGFhpq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Floyd: The Endless River","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
