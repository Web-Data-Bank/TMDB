Humiliated about having to walk home in the buff, the tykes decide to get even, declare war. Yet, as the generations battle it out, a mutual respect develops, the depth of which is evident once the man has a heart attack during one of his romps with the kids. Will the boys' older pal recuperate so that they can engage in one final battle.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/5lz9wcwGZFl4zmaP7TS0pwSHLdg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Televicine S.A. de C.V.","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1993-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Battle","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":8}
