We watch two families grasp for closure in the wake of a tragedy with ongoing political and personal ramifications. We engage those who know the most (Long experts) and those who care the most (the families of Long and Weiss) in a juxtaposition of competing narratives of the biggest political killing between McKinley and Kennedy. As the Weisses seek to rewrite history and clear their family name, the Longs strive to defend the legacy of their patriarch and preserve his iconic status.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dO1Hpwp1o12AHK4DametQFDDpPU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A battle to define history","title":"61 Bullets","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
