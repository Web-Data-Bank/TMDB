In a lighthearted exchange, Michael Collins remarked 'OK, we'll keep a close eye out for the bunny girl!' Kate Liston used that story, and its conflation of symbols somehow lost in translation, to make the three-monitor installation Moon Rabbit during her residency in China at the time of the annual mooncake festival. Through the music of the Shangri-Las and using repeated words and phrases, the myth is replayed, subtly undermining the seductive and crass glamour of the Apollo programme. -BALTIC","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MOONRABBIT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
