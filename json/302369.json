They love one another, but their class differences forbid marriage.  There's a sharp argument with the father, who afterwards wants to send the young lord abroad.  Then Sylvia is offered money to disappear, unaware that she's already pregnant.  18 years later:  Sylvia raised her son on her own as best she could.  He is now known as Lord Harford, who, besides having the title Lord Illingworth, also has inherited his father's total estate and has now returned from India.

In order to prevent that from happening, the mother must now tell each of them the truth about their identities.
