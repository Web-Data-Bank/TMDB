The concert consists of fifteen orchestral reworkings of Mills’ tracks ranging from classics such as ‘Amazon’ and ‘Sonic Destroyer’ to more recent material from his soundtracks to ‘Metropolis’ and ‘Three Ages’. The arrangement is simple: Mills provides the rhythmic backbone with his trademark 909 percussive hiss and snare while the orchestra provides the melodic and harmonic elements.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yPATH9BhTbBA2cxg7fbIWMMGbeY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeff Mills - Blue Potential","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
