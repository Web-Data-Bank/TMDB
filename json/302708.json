Famous for his patent leather shoes, monocle, and uptown swagger, Whistler's theatrics attracted the curiosity of buyers and the attention of the critics. But beneath the high gloss and mannered style, the struggle of this pioneering genius to find his own voice resulted in a breakaway style that moved painting towards abstraction and would revolutionize the art world in his time-and beyond. Best known for the groundbreaking portrait of his mother, Whistler had become one of the most recognized artists in Europe by the time of his death. He is now placed in the first rank of modern painters, his work compared to that of Velazquez and Rembrandt. Dramatic re-creations, art, graphics, and interviews combine to profile this fascinating character.","popularity":1.345,"poster_path":"/42D8pu3qd4Rxucjz9jaWRT6nyg6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James McNeill Whistler and the Case for Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
