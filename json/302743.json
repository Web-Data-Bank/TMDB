We're taking a legacy that dates back to before skis had edges and mountains had condos and we're running with it to the steepest peaks around the globe and back to the Mom and Pop hills that define skiing and riding. Since he began creating films in 1949, Warren Miller has known that as skiers and riders, there's no need to look back, we have to continuously drive to keep our edge and chase the snow. This year, we prove that not much has changed when it comes to why it is these athletes tilt and turn down mountains and pray for storms. Sheer delight. Welcome this winter season and remember there's No Turning Back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5BklZK6e9Dd6ShQaODkoLvzr6y4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warren Miller's No Turning Back","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
