At home in Minneapolis with Lynette, her wife of twenty years, s/he's Steve. Born male, Venus is transgender. S/he's \"in between\" â€” taking female hormones, but not planning to have sexual reassignment surgery. To some, s/he's a pioneer, courageously exploring a brave new world of gender identity, free of categorization. To others, s/he's a freak. VENUS OF MARS is both the unique coming out story of Venus' gender-redefining journey, and the truly contemporary love story of a couple weathering dramatic changes in uncharted relationship territory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The eye-catching transgender singer of a Minneapolis glam rock band and her wife negotiate the frontiers of love and gender.","title":"Venus of Mars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
