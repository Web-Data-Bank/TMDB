The comedian then keeps the laughter going with his mesmerizing jokes centered around everyday life that almost everyone can relate to. Red has been making audiences fall out of their seats with outlandish side-splitting humor for over a decade. He has most recently served as the host of The Pimp Chronicles II Tour featuring Katt Williams, Luenell (Borat) and Melanie Comacho (Three Strikes).
