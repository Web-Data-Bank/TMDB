His interest in the show becomes a personal one when he meets one of the models and romance blossoms. An old woman loans him her antique puppets on the condition that he not keep them in the house with him, or grave misfortunes will result. As one might expect, he ignores the warning and then starts to experience a few accidents and unusual occurrences - including being knocked out by what he thought was a puppet, and seeing flashes of a murder while he was unconscious.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":"/8ueJtxo2nVx6KVLDdDc3fWzvxQe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema City \u0026 Films Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1981-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life After Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
