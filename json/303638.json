Two years before the Tokyo Olympics, due to a revision of the Constitution, a National Defense Force is created in Japan and it starts military operations. In an incineration plant, a dog goes lost, but when Tani goes looking for him, she finds nothing. In the plant, Yanais takes down the Christmas decorations and replaces them with the ones for New Year. Gou, addicted to survival games, comes to the plant during the night and starts playing video games with Ken, even if it is his day off. In the meantime, Adachi is just watching their game to kill time. However, all these men share similar problems: pregnancy, adultery, family issues and a friend who died in the war. Meanwhile, Tani, who is troubled with her immoral relationship with Adachi, begins to feel that her father, who was the plant’s manager and is supposed to be dead, seems to be around somehow.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/bBoiMuzPJLmKahDRufga3xGxQLs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53391,"logo_path":"/7aPeLmQjH1EFhqAXWLyyxZ535QA.png","name":"Tokyo University of the Arts","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hold Your Breath Like a Lover","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
