In fact, there are many times when he considers chucking the whole thing and going back home and forgetting baseball entirely. But he perseveres... to the point where he finally believes that his players may be good enough to represent the Soviet Union in the upcoming Olympics in America. However, performing in this Country under such pressures not only shows these Russian players something about themselves, it also makes their American manager aware of something rather special about himself, as well.","popularity":0.774,"poster_path":"/9kNJJ3awLMSA5X9DOEduEyMjEUC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Comrades of Summer","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
