Oscar and Jose, two friends and former classmates, tell about the tragic ghost apparitions and their constant bickering with an albino boy. A friend from the same classroom could only see the ghost, because in Equatorial Guinea they say that albinos have four eyes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ov3aeTBq0tkDI3MMO9OqHYD9Qum.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GQ","name":"Equatorial Guinea"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria Ada","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
