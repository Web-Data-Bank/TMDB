Wind, dust, mountains, silence and time… Man and nature live together there in both harmony and conflict, amidst what is and what could be, in the vastness of a landscape grander than vision can grasp.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":41638,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anavilhana Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":41568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tempero Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
