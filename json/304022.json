Gogol is in a way the younger version of Feluda who is gadget savvy, knows mob applications, has contemporary tastes and upbringing but still loves to be in a joint family and calls its members 'pisi-na kaka-didibhai-chhotomama etc. He never uses a tab but sharpens his 'magojastro'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ishani Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2014-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gogoler Kirti","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":1}
