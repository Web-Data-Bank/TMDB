Piet Zwart worked as an interior and industrial designer, commercial typographer, photographer, critic and lecturer, playing a key role in defining the design climate in the Netherlands in the Twentieth Century. He is especially known for designing the famous ‘Piet Zwart’ kitchen for the Dutch company Bruynzeel: a kitchen that could be easily produced and consisted of standardized elements. His versatility and influence on present-day designers led the Association of Dutch Designers to award him the title of “Designer of the Century” in 2000.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Must Change: Piet Zwart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
