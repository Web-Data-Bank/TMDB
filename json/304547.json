Once valued for their fur or hunted as pests, these industrious rodents are seen in a new light through the eyes of this novel assembly of beaver enthusiasts and \"employers\" who reveal the ways in which the presence of beavers can transform and revive landscapes. Using their skills as natural builders and brilliant hydro-engineers, beavers are being recruited to accomplish everything from re-establishing water sources in bone-dry deserts to supporting whole communities of wildlife drawn to the revitalizing aquatic ecosystems their ponds provide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2qVnJqNTxzja20iFAXEbKtInKS2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leave it to Beavers","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
