Cheuk Cheung’s My Way explores the Cantonese Opera tradition of male Dan performers, men who play female roles, against the backdrop of a Hong Kong society increasingly putting less value on art. Although female performers have long been part of the mainstream of Cantonese Opera, the film follows the stories of two young men who are still fascinated by the art of the male Dan, striving to find their own way to carry on the practice. A moving and searching look at the struggle for identity, My Way is a colourful, musical and moving film which offers a unique and highly personal look at perseverance in the face of a changing society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uVe1kHQK7giy4eqFMghwowcREcb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147318,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Priori Image","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2012-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Way","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
