Forget online dating. In this hugely popular documentary, Wu Wuna seeks out Taipei’s thoroughly modern matchmaker, Chen Hailun. She looks on in amazement as Chen fixes up the most unlikely couples. More therapist for individuals than broker between families, Chen nudges the men – “why not marry her?” – and reassures the women. The stories the couples tell might inspire you to believe in love and romance all over again. But you might also notice that Wu Wuna doesn’t seem quite convinced enough to engage Chen’s services for herself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Fall In Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
