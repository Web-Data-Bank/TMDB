Irwin Stovroff, Charlie Meadow and Abe Wilen tell their stories of flying B17 Flying Forts and B24 Liberators, bailing out over occupied Europe and struggling to survive the war. Each veteran tells insightful, detailed tales of the war, which serves as a counterweight to special effects laden \"docs\" that overlook the men themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shot Up & Shot Down","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
