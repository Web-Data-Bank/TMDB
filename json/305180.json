For us, it has come to define a style of riding that is all about getting off the beaten path and exploring remote mountain ranges in search of the perfect snow and terrain. This season we returned to this core principle of Boondockers. We threw out everything we thought we knew about riding areas and set off in pursuit of unknown locations and deep powder. The result was a winter of endless fresh tracks and the most incredible boondocking we have ever captured on film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/olbVoxqZgWJ28kHmCdKDy1VmOCN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boondockers 11","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
