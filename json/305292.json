Subjects in the film range from a young woman hoping to start a family, to a mother taking care of her symptomatic 6 year-old son and ailing husband; the drummer of a major country music band, a former NBC News journalist turned HD-advocate, as well as a renowned scientist relentlessly searching for a cure. Far from giving us a hopeless glimpse into life with terminal illness, Alive &amp; Well reminds us all of our ability to persevere with strength, despite life's most difficult challenges.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9NvbnwRa9BVO25gBVm7HWZo1wcz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alive & Well","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
