The daughter of a murdered Black Panther revolutionary, Tess, (Hamilton) lives off the grid on a Sonoma vineyard, fiercely detached from all connections. Her hermetic life cracks when she gives reluctant shelter to a desperate young woman, Anna (Rabe) who has attempted suicide in a nearby forest. An unlikely alliance forms between the two, where other close relationships have failed -- David, Anna's husband, (Linklater) and John, Tess' employer (Weber), cannot break through their walls. But the very difference between the two women opens them up to a new vision of themselves, as not only survivors, but as heroes capable even of a thrilling shoot-out in the name of outlaw justice. Reclaiming freedom, and life, they plunge forward, towards an unknown, transformative horizon.","popularity":0.711,"poster_path":"/aIHHmgznSeSsNSV3JHQBvV3mEny.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55017,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dire Wolf","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Redemption Trail","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
