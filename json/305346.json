It was called \"The Red Hour Festival.\" A huge success with the fans of the original TV series (1966-69), the smash event led to much larger conventions in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles. These \"Space-Con\" conventions left an indelible mark on the science-fiction fans and \"Trekkers\" who attended. In the end, conventions like Space-Con helped awaken Paramount from hibernation and led to the creation of the first installment of the major motion picture series \"Star Trek\" in 1979. This full-length documentary film is the story of how fandom revolutionized an industry.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":39079,"logo_path":null,"name":"November Fire Recordings","origin_country":""},{"id":39080,"logo_path":"/mkeXxqeQlIzusCg38GAHFbj3v1u.png","name":"Garfield Lane Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to Space-Con","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
