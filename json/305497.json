He accepts well his change of job, but when he meets his co-workers, uncultured and rough people, he starts having second thoughts. However, he takes it easy, recognizes that they're highly trained works, and teaches them a number of (flashback) stories of pioneers of the present steam train: the early invention by Denis Papin (1679); the three legendary land-surveyors of Caton Hill; the 1769 experiment by Nicolas-Joseph De Cugnot; the 1813 machine test of William Hedley; the 1829 developments by Robert Stephenson; and finally the grand opening of the first German steam railway line of Nürnberg-Fürth - stories in which man's will to conquer the machine was sometimes met with disaster.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kbZ6eMXKfJ81huVvJbDqRMrGJLd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Willy Zielke, Kultutfilmhersteller","origin_country":""},{"id":90909,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reichsbahn-Filmstelle","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1935-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Steel Animal","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5}
