He becomes caught between his flight attendant girlfriend who is often away and a high school girl who claims to be a lesbian. A mixture of fast living and brooding melancholy, Fluffy Rhapsody is an engaging, photogenic essay on the current generation of seemingly thoughtless, but in fact overly introspective urban youth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qK6m1sDIGyFBSQPmAhqlmjjDZWQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ryefilms Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2000-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fluffy Rhapsody","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
