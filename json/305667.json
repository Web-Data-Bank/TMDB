A narrator tells the story of the saint, of St Clare and of the orders by them founded. The images then create a sort of stroll in front of the art of Giotto and Cimabue. A procession of monks with the candles are the only human elements that stand out in the representation of the city and its architecture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6FuW8fPBqdhy21y77xGp5u0jHFq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1932-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assisi By Blasetti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
