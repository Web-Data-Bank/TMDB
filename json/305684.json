That is why this year the family holiday is no luxurious stay in Portugal, but a simple domestic getaway. In fact the getaway even means a flight from Joepâ€™s criminal clients. With his wife Claire and daughter Saskia, Joep stays in an old cabin at a declining campsite. Across from them a Sinti family settles in. Whereas Claire and Joep are not particularly keen on getting in touch with the family, something beautiful blooms between Saskia and Dukker, the son of the Sintis.","popularity":0.71,"poster_path":"/oI3NXmPnRlHY7Lsn0Ryki0K5HvN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Away","video":false,"vote_average":3.667,"vote_count":3}
