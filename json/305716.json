Oscilloscope is filmed with Canon HFS100 camera. Saturation, brightness, and contrast adjustments are made in software to view the output better -- much better results could be achieved with further fine tuning of the display and camera. This type of effect is similar to those achievable by historical devices like the Scanimate and Rutt-Etra machines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LZX Visionary - Vector Rescanning Experiments","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
