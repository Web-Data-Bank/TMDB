This is not the TV series, \"Emergency!\"  These are real people who are hurt.  You not only get a glimpse of the gory results of accidents; you see emergency care before the paramedics came into vogue (1969). Miami rolled out the first paramedics that year while Los Angeles County (basis of \"Emergency!), along with Portland, began providing street medicine.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/6mDMJIlR7TSDi9Q8dr5FBOS43dn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Highway Safety Foundation (HSF)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Highways of Agony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
