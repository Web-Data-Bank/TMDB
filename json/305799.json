Under mother's wing, Jordi spends all his time on the Internet. His only adventure is a ride on the back of his girlfriend's motorbike. One day, a coincidental but shocking discovery on the Net forces him to start searching for his identity, away from his familiar environment. It takes him to a confrontation with his biological father who was supposed dead, but appears to live in Ireland and does not immediately press his lost son in his arms. Kilkenny Cross is a coming-of-age drama, in which the Dutch urban water landscape contrasts with the green hills of Ireland and the impassiveness of modern means of communication with the longing for human intimacy. A chat session between mother and son leads to an emotional climax. In a cameo role, female novelist Manon Uphoff explains what true love means.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kilkenny Cross","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
