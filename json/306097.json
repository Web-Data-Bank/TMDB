This sparkling production continues the Rossini one-act opera series emerging from the Schwetzingen Festival with excellent direction, acting and stagecraft. Director Michael Hampe created a perfect realization of the opera in the small, jewel-like Rococo Theatre of Schwetzingen Palace in May 1989.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7srmvkdbTqH3EGct0fpGs4XTdDX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossini Opera Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La cambiale di matrimonio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
