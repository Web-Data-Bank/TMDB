On the podium was the young conductor Karl Böhm. This opera is a masterpiece of early 20th-century vocal music. Structured in a single act, Daphne is a very consistent work with a rich musical vein. Strauss's orchestration appears, as always, remarkably refined. Vocal writing is demanding for all the main characters, but especially so for the protagonist, here finely interpreted by a magnificent June Anderson.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daphne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
