The county is protected from the Confederacy by an abolitionist and a Native American gentleman. The abolitionist's daughter is courted by a powerful newspaper publisher when her fiance, a confederate officer, elopes with the girl's sister. The daughter at first resists the publisher's attentions, but turns to him for aid when her ex-fiance plans to capture the seceding county on behalf of the South.","popularity":1.406,"poster_path":"/844Gez3RtTvbAgb3b9SGWp24H1V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Wanger Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10330,"logo_path":"/nY62adzeba5GVK8LJYD6yd9R8H4.png","name":"Universal International Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When she lost her lover...her sister gained one!","title":"Tap Roots","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
