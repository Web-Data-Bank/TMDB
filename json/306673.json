Conceived on an intimate scale (only the artist's hands are visible as he manipulates a range of objects), Baldessari's Super-8 films replace text and speech with a cunning visual language, in which he wordlessly describes physical changes in his environment: a bright light flashes on a mirrored surface, red liquid rises in a thermometer, and powdered pigment makes an indelible mess. Here Baldessari employs a method of communication that is based on spectacle rather than performance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dr3RFnoh50Gz75GzJId8RQ62xz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Short Films","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
