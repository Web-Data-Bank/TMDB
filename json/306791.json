RAI television film, based on a short story (1954) by Carlo Cassola and scripted by Marcello Fondato and Giuseppe Lazzari, filmed on location, aired on 19-9-1963. It is the simple story of a group of woodcutters in the Grossetano area with their problems, individual stories, small and big intimate dramas. It is a film with a Rossellini-style realist slant where, without falling into scenicism, the importance of the landscape is combined with the psychological subtlety of the characters and the lucid and critical description of their behaviour. \"A phenomenological film that manages to introduce, in the objectivity of the realistic vision, a disturbing moral dimension\" (G. Rondolino).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bkdXVnzcFVnMEb0FRM1rF9p2WnC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1963-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timber Cutting","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
