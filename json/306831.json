Deep in debt and receiving little help from her husband, Nora has nothing to live for except for Sarah. Living in a community suffering from abject poverty, Nora sifts through trash and spends time with Vilma, a happily single shopkeeper, and Minda, whose truck-driver husband disappeared a month ago presumably to live with another woman. With no other viable options to support her daughter, Nora turns to prostitution.","popularity":1.2,"poster_path":"/uijhONE3wlJS3rAPUpqDpWm26n7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2010-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chassis","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
