The locations depicted in the film are digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from real photos and map data where available.  Without any apparent story, other than what you may fill in by yourself, the idea with the film is primarily to show a glimpse of the fantastic and beautiful nature that surrounds us on our neighboring worlds - and above all, how it might appear to us if we were there.","popularity":2.163,"poster_path":"/2e1XbXF7tYIhtqTf587PQxImpDI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short film by Erik Wernquist","title":"Wanderers","video":false,"vote_average":7.278,"vote_count":54}
