The children, as young as two or three, have room and time to question, wonder, and learn. We build a wading pool, use tools, climb and swing, bath a dog - and learn to live together. There are spats, and little adult interference. A tree house sparks children's imagination. They visit a neighboring farm, play with the animals and ride on a tractor that's plowing. They eat and nap. There's story time, easels for art, and a lollipop. It's the perfect place for city children to be safe from bombardment, says the narrator.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b9oySRtIraUJhl55eiU8SnXvmde.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75887,"logo_path":"/1uUQZlr9mVDytTHXPVzHNM7aJT6.png","name":"National Association of Early Childhood Teacher Educators","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Child Went Forth","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
