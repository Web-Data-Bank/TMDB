The life of the character he played was hauntingly close to his own, a young, restless man of mixed heritage, struggling for a foothold on the edge of two cultures. Tom's mother is a traditional Indigenous woman of southern Arnhem Land, his father a Welsh stockman who he never really knew. Yellow Fella is a journey across the land and into Tom's past, as he attempts to find the resting place of his father and to finally confront the truth of his most inner feelings of love and identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8A9AxWDxGqYrgc3LBWiOvMEsEA3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2005-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I'm not black, I'm not white, I'm a yellow fella and I'm gonna stay that way","title":"Yellow Fella","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
