The couple’s daughter, Lila, serves as a mirror reflecting her parents’ frustrations and joys. The long takes, atmospheric music, and stellar performances, give a poignant, sometimes hilarious portrayal of a family as they attempt to negotiate their egos with their marriage and artistic lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aJKYHXYkWjgZ8eyywHH4GPcnlaY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39257,"logo_path":null,"name":"MyS Producción","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before Opening Night","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
