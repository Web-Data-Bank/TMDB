When Raju's dad passes away, the local money-lender gives him an ultimatum to either re-pay the loan or he will take possession of his house and land. Raju decides to hitch a ride to Bombay, get a job, save some money, buy a couple of bullocks, till his land and re-pay the money-lender. No one gives him a ride, so he stows away in the back of a fruit-laden truck, which has one more stowaway, a run-away gypsy named Tarna. Both of them meet, fall in love, promise to help and marry each other. After the truck ride, they board a goods train bound for Bombay, but during the journey both get separated. A few months Raju finds out that Tarna is now known as Meenakshi, a movie actress.","popularity":1.526,"poster_path":"/hRb0yB8z1B5zoSVQbeiGZ1bV609.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mere Humsafar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
