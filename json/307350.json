In this wandering we follow the main character – a deadly girl with a violent and disturbed response to the emotional paranoia and alienation that the “concrete jungle” can generate. The lumpen characters and the rest “strays of the streets” that she runs into, the street art and the trash, become part of the set, composing a haunted picture of the modern “ghost town”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2014-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drag Me: A Urban Music Tale","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2}
