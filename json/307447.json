Nutubihari is an idealist who has given up his love for Kalyani  for the sake of his beliefs. He marries Bimala and becomes a lawyer, fighting for the rights of the poor against the feudal lords. Meanwhile, Kalyani comes to ask refuge after she becomes a widow and is inexplicably accepted by Bimala with a lot of warmth. As the years pass Kalyani's daughter Mamata and Nutu's oldest son Arun fall in love and wish to get married. However, the new-found fame and fortune turns his head and Nutu begins to resemble all the ideals and vices that he had always despised. On the other hand in an ironical turn of events, Arun comes to occupy the position once held by his father, highlighting the generational conflict of ideals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5fXmQSBMh7AjXL530YKQP7OoaTW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176990,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Theatres, Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1945-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Generations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
