He does not want to end up like so many others around him who are destined for jail or the cemetery before they make it out of their teens. He tries to follow the right path but after losing his dead-end job and discovering that his live-in girlfriend is pregnant, he decides that he has to cook up a plan to get money - lots of money, and fast.  His best friend Brandon introduces him to a secret club in Brooklyn known as The Pit, where unsigned street rappers from all across New York City battle it out on stage rapping for money and the title to be called the best. Run by a local gangster named G-Mega, Dequan enters The Pit where he finds himself winning the rapping wars, making more money but also getting caught in a world of corruption, drugs and death that he can't escape.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/ugvJqyLusCbbYg969HbzXl4Rg6B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crook Brothers Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":4383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maverick Entertainment Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ripple Effect Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The battle for fame, money and respect.","title":"Rap War One","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
