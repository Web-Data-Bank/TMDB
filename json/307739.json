But the best story on the tape, \"Too Much TV,\" stars Lisa Hatter as a girl who watches a slasher-movie host on cable all day, figuring out ways to kill her sarcastic mother Sonja Etzel, while we watch B-movie parodies like \"Don't Go Into the Kitchen,\" \"Bathroom Bullies,\" \"Pretty Girl Floyd,\" \"Nursing Home Revenge,\" and \"Missouri Mop Massacre.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rId2rSxWFwz7DJgDhGI93d1rqte.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satan Place: A Soap Opera from Hell","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
