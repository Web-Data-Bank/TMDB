He saves his hard-earned money with Lakhsmi, and when the time comes for Sundari's marriage & dowry, he goes to take his money, only to be humiliated by Lakhsmi. Sundari's marriage gets canceled, she kills herself, and Bhoop in turn kills Lakhsmi, subsequently takes to a life of crime, amasses a huge fortune, gives birth to a daughter, Nisha, and ends up in jail after double-crossing his partner-in-crime, Vikram Singh. He instructs his wife to bring up Nisha, as a widow. In prison, Bhoop meets with a honest man, Jaswant Singh, who has come to the city to look for his estranged brother. Bhoop asks Jaswant to look after his wife and daughter - not realizing that he may have made another mistake as Jaswant has an alias - that of bandit Dhurjan Singh, and is also the brother of Vikram Singh.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1986-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaanch Ki Deewar","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
