An increasing obsession with mysterious fetish objects ultimately results in a tear in the fabric of reality that threatens to turn their respective worlds inside out. A hallucinatory fever dream in which nothing is what it at first appears to be, Sanctum and Sacrum opens a portal between the ancient world of myth and symbol and the banal pastels of a Florida apartment. It is a matrix of transformation, in which the lives of two couples intersect via a web spun from trance-like rituals of desire and the ever present origin of myth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanctum and Sacrum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
