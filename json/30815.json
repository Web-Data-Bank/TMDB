If ever a person got what he deserved, it's James Urbanksi, an abusive drunk who steals from his wife, Joyce, and promises her close friend Cynthia Kellogg that she'll be the next target of his rage. At a group outing, James bleeds to death after someone cuts his throat. But because he's such a terrible human being, police aren't sure which of his acquaintances decided to kill him.","popularity":7.329,"poster_path":"/3Py7bFBsRjMVdOI5IlNSz6aa385.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15117,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Visions Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":62072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polar Entertainment Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":162554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rufglen Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-04-19","revenue":18800000,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Murder is a secret that should never be shared.","title":"Mortal Thoughts","video":false,"vote_average":5.649,"vote_count":152}
