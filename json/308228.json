His sister and brother-in-law want him to marry again so that his daughter can have the love and care of a woman. Amar reluctantly agrees. Together they set out to check out two sisters, Shobha, and Sheela. Amar goes as Dayal, and Dayal goes as Amar, as Amar is not sure if a step-mother will be able to bestow care and love as a real mother. They arrive at the household of Durga, Shanti Swarup, Renu, Sheela, and their servant Geeta. They begin to settle down, Dayal in a spacious room, and Amar in the servant's quarters, which consists of an untidy room with no electricity. It is not long before Amar finds out that he is attracted to Geeta, and not to the two sisters, but in his present state, he cannot reveal himself and openly propose marriage. In the meantime, Durga starts getting suspicious about Amar and starts wondering if Amar is actually a servant or a crook.","popularity":0.732,"poster_path":"/fTiCcMEZXilz4SD9MVlXmTcgLRd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1979-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nauker","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
