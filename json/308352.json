There is a choice to be made, and the woman begins to hesitate. Only the words of the loving Carlo will be able to transform fear into courage. At one point the setting makes way for animation, suggested and overlapped by the words of Clara. It leads the listener to a deep reflection on life. The brief evocation of the magic of existence is imprinted in the deeply moved smile of the woman, certain that life on Earth is nothing but a stage of eternity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Industrie Cinematografiche Italiane (ICI)","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":40350,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZenMovie","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2013-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A couple, a lifetime in common","title":"Carlo and Clara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
