The experience is not obvious and the ten tenants have to cope with more than one difficulty. But they also have their moments. Things really go awry when Françoise, an unmarried girl, is forced to deliver the baby she carries prematurely and when Solange, the lonely girl of the group, attempts suicide. Shortly afterwards, the group learns that the house is due for demolition. They decide to take advantage of this opportunity to face adult life individually.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dvuKZukBJgKwtgV6T7ifkntullv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spiralfilm","origin_country":""},{"id":32790,"logo_path":null,"name":"Planfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1967-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boys and Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
