When they receive an emotional last-minute plea not meant for Saint Nick, but instead written to God, they must delay their own travel plans to make sure one little girl doesn’t lose her Christmas joy—something Oliver and Shane are also struggling to find as they each face painful holiday memories. With a little guidance from a mysterious post office volunteer, Jordan, the Postables are more surprised than anyone to discover they've been a part of more than one miracle on this Christmas Eve.","popularity":2.111,"poster_path":"/yoMg33yFaBs7JYt2pPAoe0E6q0Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6438,"logo_path":"/hQVRii7CRnfG0rowSEc6ibt2Pke.png","name":"Muse Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":43882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moon Water Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Signed, Sealed, Delivered for Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":7.023,"vote_count":22}
