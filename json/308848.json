He makes it through to the last round with the arrogant yuppie Alex. The younger and self-assured Alex seems to have a better chance of getting the job and Onno will not tolerate that. A few days before the last interview, he kidnaps his opponent and locks him up in a remote cottage that his girlfriend has just inherited near a railway line. As soon as he gets the job, he releases his victim. Three years later - Onno now lives together and has a son - he is a successful curator at the Rijksmuseum and needs an assistant. While interviewing applicants, he is confronted with Alex, now blind in one eye.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c75jnnNuZA80H5uuuBsLil3dUNO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4313,"logo_path":null,"name":"AVRO Television","origin_country":""},{"id":4588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Egmond Film \u0026 Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1999-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 18.10 Train","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":3}
