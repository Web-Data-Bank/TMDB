This doesn't sit too well with her naturalist boyfriend, who seems to like cockroaches more than her. And now the omens are against them: the day they've chosen for marriage is the very same one that Lau's strict aunt demands for his mother's funeral. So, this comedy goes back and forth between the two venues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qxtXJZkW3RtYwMEovn7WKz9oH7f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once in a Life-Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
