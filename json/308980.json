Instead, he becomes the victim of mental abuse by his classmates. In search of recognition, he goes to his old Lasnamäe friends, who spend their time doing drugs, hanging around, and partying, rather than focusing on schoolwork. At home, Johannes must deal with his mother’s deteriorating mental health. As the tension grows, he finds himself at zero point, where he must completely reset his life to build it up from scratch.","popularity":1.617,"poster_path":"/pMmedMqnkFSpkx5it49TWvg4OcE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":45345,"logo_path":"/fb5rZB6gnthrxAeIYlRutKdGzV.png","name":"Estonian Public Broadcasting (ERR)","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2014-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life is f****d. hit reset.","title":"Zero Point","video":false,"vote_average":7.091,"vote_count":22}
