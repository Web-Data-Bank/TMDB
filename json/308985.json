The truth is, however, that their relationship has reached a dead end but they prefer the illusory decorations of living together to the free fall into emptiness. The man gallivants around between his previous and current relationships without knowing exactly what to do with them. Living on the edge starts to overburden his nervous system and as a result, actual reality and dream-like reality blend together and it becomes ever harder to distinguish between what is real and what is not.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/voTyGdvAxRlufMBQI4zot0mSmnw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5974,"logo_path":"/vgPUbUDwVGL1ruiPv2KFtjh75UD.png","name":"Making Movies","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2014-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landscape with Many Moons","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
