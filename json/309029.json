In the daytime, Joan attends to his daily training to prepare him for work as entertainer in Japan. At night, he works as one of the female impersonators in Manila’s gay bars. All these to feed a family of eighteen. Although it will be Joan’s fourth trip to Japan, he still finds it hard to make as much money to make their lives better. Meeting other gay entertainers in the bar where he works, they talk about the difficulties Filipino entertainers experience while working in Japan. The situation is no different though from the life lived by someone like Joan in the Philippines who was once caught in a drug bust operation and sent to jail. Threats and difficulties seem to hound these sex warriors wherever they go.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hQSoNzxoIXoiiSvL0ldfADYNOgC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155038,"logo_path":null,"name":"Formation Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sex Warriors and the Samurai","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
