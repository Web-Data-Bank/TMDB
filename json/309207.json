In order to maintain his lifestyle, he is persuaded by a good friend to adopt the newly rich self-made millionaire Otto Meier and his family. With a title of nobility, Otto and his family would finally come to social recognition. Emanuel, in turn, would not have to worry about covering his bank account.
