Stanley Milgram designs a psychology experiment that still resonates to this day, in which people think they’re delivering painful electric shocks to an affable stranger strapped into a chair in another room. Despite his pleads for mercy, the majority of subjects don’t stop the experiment, administering what they think is a near-fatal electric shock, simply because they’ve been told to do so. With Nazi Adolf Eichmann’s trial airing in living rooms across America, Milgram strikes a nerve in popular culture and the scientific community with his exploration into people’s tendency to comply with authority. Celebrated in some circles, he is also accused of being a deceptive, manipulative monster, but his wife Sasha stands by him through it all.","popularity":9.405,"poster_path":"/bcVhkScQvO4QH5rqOkZwXJo1K99.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17090,"logo_path":"/jBySWM1rnLX2oZ8bXImCGqAB4pr.png","name":"FJ Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":41602,"logo_path":null,"name":"BB Film Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Stanley Milgram Story","title":"Experimenter","video":false,"vote_average":6.576,"vote_count":407}
