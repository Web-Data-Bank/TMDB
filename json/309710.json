By creating a forum where Muslim women can freely engage in an open dialogue about complex issues, filmmaker Farah Nousheen exposes a vast and fascinating array of thoughts and ideas. The women discuss their views on Islam, current political events and how they reflect on the image of Islam in the West. The women also talk about the difficulty of achieving equality within the Muslim community while also fighting stereotypical portrayals of Muslim women in the US media. Nazrah (the Arabic word for \"perspective\") also includes director Farah Nousheen's own views on being a Muslim woman at a time when Islam is in the international spotlight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nazrah: A Muslim Woman's Perspective","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
