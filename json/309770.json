A young orphan girl, Ayden, receives a magic crystal from a dying elf, with a warning that the North has lost its magic, and that she alone can save Christmas.  Ayden and her orphan friends begin a perilous journey and must escape dragons, goblins, bandits, ogres, and other fantasy creatures as they team up with Airk, the wayward son of Father Christmas, to return a stolen Christmas orb to the North.  When Santa's magic cannot overpower the growing Snarl (an evil forest with tentacle branches), Ayden and Airk must deliver Christmas on a sleigh pulled by a young dragon, fulfilling Christmas wishes for children to restore Santa's magic and save Christmas.","popularity":5.111,"poster_path":"/aX6JE4JJvxIHEgaUfB25dGskdZd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9074,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mainstay Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14787,"logo_path":"/cZWB9HeQ1e4G6qcy8hUu7GT4vMV.png","name":"Arrowstorm Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Follow the Magic","title":"The Christmas Dragon","video":false,"vote_average":5.933,"vote_count":30}
