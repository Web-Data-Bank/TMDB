But ultimately, the preacher’s steely resolve to preserve his family’s evangelical legacy in the community and dwindling congregation dissolves under relentless pressure from his status-seeking wife and greedy church leaders—Lured by cash bribes and promises from unscrupulous developers to establish a flashy “mega-ministry” elsewhere.  Soon, the spirits of founding congregational members – stirred from the disquiet of their graves by the remorseless trespasses of another generation – begin to make their displeasure known. As the sinners – abruptly and inexplicably bound within the confines of the sanctuary – fall prey, they must all re-examine their choices and bow to the will of the covenant … only to reveal the righteous among them.","popularity":2.18,"poster_path":"/gLMgHdREeKWLC1kSO24o4CvBl7n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hard Floor Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Church","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
