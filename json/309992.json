A rather talentless would-be hack substitutes his own script for the work of a deceased roommate who actually has some financing in place, and the result is a hilariously tasteless film within a film High School Shootings -The Musical. Over a hundred Vancouver area film school graduates, friends and musicians worked on this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shooting: The Musical","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
