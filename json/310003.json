They brought in supplies, set up relief stations, and for ten months fed and cared for the recovery workers. Many deep and unexpected - even unlikely - relationships developed out of this. Using cinema verite footage, interviews and archival photographs, we follow several characters through a series of events reuniting them with each other after the closing of the site. Through their stories we present a portrait of the city within a city that was Ground Zero, and examine how an extremely diverse group of people transcended politics and culture in an effort to heal their city and themselves. 9/12: From Chaos to Community - a 60-minute character-driven documentary - is a vibrant, moving, sometimes funny, sometimes painful portrayal of hope and healing in the wake of disaster.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wuwLSkZEUGPVLMsLRbPWABFtQym.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9/12: From Chaos to Community","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
