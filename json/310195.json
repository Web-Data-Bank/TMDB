This documentary presents startlingly up-close views of Bill Clinton's path through the primaries, the Democratic convention, and the televised debates with President George H.W. Bush.  Produced for PBS' groundbreaking series \"The 90s,\" and directed by pioneering video journalist Scott Jacobs, ROAD TO THE PRESIDENCY goes far beyond simple campaign reporting.  It is compelling viewing that is at times funny and poignant as well as instructive, and provides an inside-look at the 2004 Presidential election.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road to the Presidency","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
