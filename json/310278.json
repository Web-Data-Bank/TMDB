Railroads traverse these mountains by way of scenic routes and steep grades. Put winter and railroads together, and the result is something special: mile long freight trains braving white flurries, passenger coaches on mountain excursions, and small operators battling the elements. This is a Western Winter Wonderland.  Featuring:  Stevens Pass, Marias Pass, Mullan Pass, Deer Lodge Pass, Canadian Rockies, Donner Pass, Shasta, McCloud, Pengra Pass, and Port of Tillamook Bay Railroad.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Western Winter Wonderland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
