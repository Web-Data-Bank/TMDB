In the face of adversity, he shows great courage and spiritual strength. This is a film with multiple layers. It is about sharing, daring and being grateful for what we have. It is also an exploration of social values, some of them controversial. Many of Jose's choices have been strongly criticized by his family and people around him. As a result, this is also a film about self discovery: a way to explore what we judge ... and what we choose to accept and forgive.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fTcOkFYEH107Q6N4dUrKExf76MH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asola Films","origin_country":""},{"id":107488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eva Norvind Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":107489,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buena Onda Americas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2008-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nacido Sin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
