This is what Ha-young (Lee Yo-won) has to do for her best friend, Mi-ryung (Kim Min-hee). Mi-ryung has been planning for a surprise party for her overseas boyfriend Jun-woo (Shin Ha-gyun), but her plans are stopped short when her father finds out that Jun-woo is half-Hawaiian, and forbids the party from being held. Mi-ryung is put under even greater pressure when Jun-Woo tells her that he would arrive early, and she pleads with Ha-Young to intercept Jun-Woo at the airport, and to keep him from turning up at Mi-ryung's place before she can iron things out.","popularity":1.161,"poster_path":"/n2TPgcoMCqyqq3fw1qfyfodPFeN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7036,"logo_path":"/javbyY0ZCvlFJtly3tpZqf2NwLX.png","name":"CJ Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":4580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine2000","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2002-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surprise Party","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
