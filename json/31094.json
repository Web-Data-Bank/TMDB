After the war, he was investigated as part of the Allies' de-Nazification programme. In the bombed-out Berlin of the immediate post-war period, the Allies slowly bring law and order to bear on an occupied Germany. An American major is given the Furtwangler file, and is told to find everything he can and to prosecute the man ruthlessly. Tough and hard-nosed, Major Steve Arnold sets out to investigate a world of which he knows nothing.","popularity":2.093,"poster_path":"/8u4rFSYUE4cMIas85JaowBXxl52.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paladin Production S.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":111293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maecenas Film- und Fernseh GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":264,"logo_path":"/fA90qwUKgPhMONqtwY60GaHRyrW.png","name":"Studio Babelsberg","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":76883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Big Bear Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taking Sides","video":false,"vote_average":6.183,"vote_count":30}
