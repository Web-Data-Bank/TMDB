But is it really?... I Stay with You starts out  as an innocent comedy with rich girls having carefree fun. Gradually,  however, the film undergoes a transformation, ending in dark  sadism. Artist Artemio Narro has made a number of installations  and videos on the subject of violence. His first fiction feature is not  only a commentary on the ever-present violence in Mexico, but  also on how we see violence. The changing tone of the film and an  ingenious turnaround in the battle of the sexes makes this film a  confrontational experience.","popularity":2.902,"poster_path":"/1vgYHBv9h003mubMyHbkAkbe4iy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48413,"logo_path":null,"name":"mar","origin_country":""},{"id":48405,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cuarto Para las Doce","origin_country":""},{"id":48409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Endímia","origin_country":""},{"id":48414,"logo_path":null,"name":"el llanero solirario","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2014-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Stay with You","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":17}
