The source of the sound (the loudspeakers) in a continuous hand-held panning (guided by the music), is intercut with shots of flowers or wood-fire, exemplifying the lyricism in Puccini’s music. By being a recording of a recording, the work proclaims the artificiality of the sound. However the beauty and humanity of the music comes through too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g0Fv5RiRLgmKUYrPC0SnByZhgB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puccini Conservato","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
