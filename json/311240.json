A young man, Sanshiro Sugata, troubled by personal problems, takes up judo. His teacher, Shogoro Yano, is a devout man who has aroused the enmity of the local practitioners of jujitsu, the older and more accepted of the two sports. Sugata uses his newly learned prowess to gain a measure of respect from others; however, Shogoro insists that the sport has a spiritual side, a lesson Sugata has yet to learn. Eventually, in hand-to-hand combat with the father of a young woman he loves, he comes to understand the true meaning of judo.","popularity":2.253,"poster_path":"/uasRQFEHvxZeu0u8uWY7sKq6VO4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":882,"logo_path":"/iDw9Xxok1d9WAM2zFicI8p3khTH.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":2680,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kurosawa Production","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Eiga Company Ltd.","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1965-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Judo Saga","title":"Sanshiro Sugata","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":5}
