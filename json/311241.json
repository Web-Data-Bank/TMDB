It broke Carnegie Hall's two day box office gross record, and was the fastest sell-out in the historic venue's history. The concert also raised money for Columbia Presbyterian Babies Hospital. This event was produced by Richard Flanzer and Roger Daltrey of English rock band The Who in celebration of his fiftieth birthday. The Who's music was arranged for orchestra by Michael Kamen, who directed The Juilliard Orchestra for the event. Pete Townshend, John Entwistle, Eddie Vedder, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Lou Reed, David Sanborn, Alice Cooper, Linda Perry, The Chieftains and others performed as special guests.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t2ZtDNDvQUsTkMrozxxNmBio7zP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
