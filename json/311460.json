Daniel Samsa (John Holgren) of the Samsa foundation is determined to learn the facts about that tragic case, and he's brought along the late convict's daughter Carrie (Daisy Leonard) to help contact him in the afterlife. Joining this pair in their supernatural quest is an ex-con named Hector (Dan Herrera), an itinerant psychic named Jason (Stu Brumbaugh), and an intuitive named Frank (Mick O'Day). But this mysterious building harbors plenty of sinister secrets, and when the prison goes on lock-down, the shaken ghost hunters realize this is one mission they might never come home from.","popularity":1.247,"poster_path":"/mimT5a0eEnawfpsRxDt2e9Wy2aO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yellow Wood Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Getting in was easy, getting out will be murder...","title":"The Vessel","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3}
