It centers around the sweet, bright-eyed and emotionally vulnerable Faybien (RayMartell Moore). Comfortable with his gayness but saddled with self-esteem issues, Faybien's love life is put into an emotional spin when his ex, Lonnie, returns with an interest in reigniting their relationship. You'd think that he'd get a sympathetic ear from his friends, but they already have their own issues. Reggie's in love with bisexual, non-committal Greg; high-strung queen bee Amera is certain her boyfriend is cheating on her; and the always-meddling muscle queen Jay is busy confronting his rough trade boyfriend's girlfriend.","popularity":1.557,"poster_path":"/aAOwsW2x1duQC74xGoiIiJGPMNO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Me: Truth","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":3}
