Though the setting is transposed to the 1930s, England is torn by civil war, split between the rivaling houses of York and Lancaster. Richard aspires to a fascist dictatorship, but must first remove the obstacles to his ascension—among them his brother, his nephews and his brother's wife. When the Duke of Buckingham deserts him, Richard's plans are compromised.","popularity":9.101,"poster_path":"/cJYgc7UYfQE4EaKzR6Qwy3PF478.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mayfair Entertainment International","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":871,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Screen","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":60,"logo_path":"/1SEj4nyG3JPBSKBbFhtdcHRaIF9.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13534,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Look Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":38025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bayly/Paré Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-12-29","revenue":2748518,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I can smile, and murder while I smile","title":"Richard III","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":147}
