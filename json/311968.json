Kalloo wants to write a love-letter to Laxmi, and is unable to do so, as he cannot read nor write. When he discusses this matter with his grandma, he is told that it is not necessary for him to learn to read and write, as the family is wealthy, and this matter can be taken care of by hiring someone who can read and write.
