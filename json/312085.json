In a state known for football, no game is bigger than the annual rivalry between Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Texas. In its 106 year history, no game had more heartfelt emotion than the 1999 contest at Kyle Field.  On November 18th, just eight days before the game, the Aggies' traditional bonfire collapsed. 12 A&amp;M students who were working on the stack tragically died, and several others were injured. Relive the eight days in November 1999 through interviews and retrospectives of those who were a part of a game week like no other in A&amp;M history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Burning Desire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
