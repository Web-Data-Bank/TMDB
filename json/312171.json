The conversations are candid, and even veer into the territory of murder. In the final credits, the director apologizes to Jim Jarmusch, whose work (in the anthology Coffee and Cigarettes, which Jarmusch shot in pieces over many years) Oldenburg-Svintsov is clearly indebted to. Sex, Coffee, Cigarettes’s kinship with Jarmusch’s film extends to the fact that superstars play tiny roles in almost all of the vignettes.","popularity":2.254,"poster_path":"/t1kBYBdJR9zLdfMYObKhKCyJnQq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41569,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film No 1","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex, Coffee, Cigarettes","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":8}
