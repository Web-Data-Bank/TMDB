Great, except that he knows three Sandras: one he'd love to hear from, one he'd hate to hear from and a third he'd never expect to call him. Paul desperately wants to find out who is the woman who called and enlists the help of his close friend, who is a ladies man. Marc, though very busy himself and eager to pursue his business, agrees to help. And so begins an urgent investigation. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":41769,"logo_path":null,"name":"BellaCoola Multimedia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Paul checks his answering machine and gets a message from Sandra.
