The first French anti-colonialist film, the film derived from an assignment in which the director was to cover educational activities by the French League of Schooling in West Africa. Vautier later filmed what he saw, a \"lack of teachers and doctors, the crimes committed by the French Army in the name of France, the instrumentalization of the colonized peoples\". For his role in the film Vautier was imprisoned over several months. The film was not permitted to be shown for more than 40 years.","popularity":1.041,"poster_path":"/uGSLjdtbWH83HsF8DL8CKqMZf6U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ligue française de l'enseignement","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1950-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afrique 50","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":22}
