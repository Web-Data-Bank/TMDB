Not wanting to miss out, the mole starts digging. When he gets there it's nice and quiet with just a few crabs and a sailing boat to keep him company. But then the hordes arrive. And no matter where he pops his head out of the sand, there's no room for a mole anymore. It's not until night time, when the moon shines on all the leftover rubbish, that things quiet down again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8QLj4ZOH9g1qbLoZESx0D5X069x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2012-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mole at the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
