Tak is a gambler, too much so for his girlfriend to risk marriage. Daddy, a single father, is harsh with his son who reminds him of the woman who abandoned them. Monk is mercurial, talkative, a show-off. Kong, a steady family man, keeps the peace. Sam is new, hoping to fit in and make it as a cop. Three brutal and murderous robbers are on the loose, and so is a former soldier, embittered over the loss of his pension, using very real bombs to extort what's due him. It's a dangerous job, and the cops must watch each other's back, regardless of their personal problems.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xyXqdIIJ7Xhq8y07yjiUjuSlBJl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Heat of Summer","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
