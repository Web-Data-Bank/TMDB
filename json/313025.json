It is both a barrier and highway, a silver ribbon holding back the rugged landscapes of the west from the gentler plains to the east. On its journey south, the Shannon passes through a huge palette of rural landscapes, where on little-known backwaters, Ireland’s wild animals and plants still thrive as almost nowhere else. For a year, wildlife cameraman Colin Stafford-Johnson lives on the river, camping on its banks, exploring its countless tributaries in a traditional canoe, following the river from dawn to dusk through the four seasons, on a quest to film the natural history of the Shannon as it has never been seen or heard or experienced before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wKrLhwJxiAUJAiTdDmEmkw0hDwo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15964,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ireland's Wild River","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
