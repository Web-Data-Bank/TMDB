In that, an alien presence surveys a stretch of coastline strewn with assorted objects from early 1960s British lifestyles and tries (and mostly fails) to divine their meaning or purpose. The Preservation Man is also set in a series of object-strewn settings, but here they're part of the artist Bruce Lacey's collection of random junk, and their original function is irrelevant. Sensibly, Russell and commentator Huw Wheldon keep analysis to a minimum, preferring to use the film as an excuse to spend quarter of an hour in Lacey's amiable company.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/asa5cPc8AwBfJXzKkE3YJFoKWsi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Preservation Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
