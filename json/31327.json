As the war wound to a close and violence persisted in the streets of Paris, the FLN and its supporters adopted the tactic of murdering French policemen in hopes of forcing a withdrawal. When French law enforcement retaliated by brutalizing Algerians and imposing a strict curfew, the FLN organizes a peaceful demonstration that drew over 11,000 supporters, resulting in an order from the Paris police chief to take brutal countermeasures. Told through the eyes of both French policemen as well as Algerian protestors, Tasma’s film attempts to get to the root of the tragedy by presenting both sides of the story.","popularity":1.231,"poster_path":"/aNwIvuMApHpbqovZQPsvN3Zqm3c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuit noire, 17 octobre 1961","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":9}
