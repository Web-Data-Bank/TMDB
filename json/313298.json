The film opens with young, pretty Maki (Natsuo Ishido) luring a drunken salariman into a parking lot only to be mugged by Maki's brother, Shinji (played by former child star Mitsunori Isaki). Unfortunately, the drunk proves to be no ordinary working stiff, but a gangster who takes a dim view of petty crime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3YWuUAMFtwcZFFnaPNt6OspWEMW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4667,"logo_path":"/kW2HfJ2R3xBfXRW6jdevcSGavHT.png","name":"Bitters End","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Waltz","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
