From each corner of the earth, five climbers – Sam Elias, James Pearson, Caroline Ciavaldini, Jacopo Larcher and Yuji Hirayama – attempt to open a new multi-pitch route on the basalt island of Reunion. Lost in the South Indian Ocean, Reunion is the childhood home of Caroline and, after traveling the world for several years as a professional climber, returning was something she had to do. By working together as climbers and friends, the team is able to open, ground-up, one of the hardest multi-pitch rock climbs in the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xMtfuJfcEYsz1a4zW0Vq9tSfy2L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42895,"logo_path":"/ygpDcAmydnkwZ1NSCbJfh3Z2xqs.png","name":"Ananda Media","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zembrocal","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
