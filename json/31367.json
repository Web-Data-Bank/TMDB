Two of them have been beatified.","popularity":1.721,"poster_path":"/qSqYHTVs6vffsIcxjF2Im47YC0U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ignatius Press","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2009-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 13th Day","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
