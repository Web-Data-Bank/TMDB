Fifteen years later, weakened, isolated, betrayed by many of his own, the \"Lion of Panshir\" has not surrendered to his new and implacable enemies, the Taliban. While preparing his next offensive, he evokes his commitment and his fights, and bears witness to a history in which he has been one of the main actors for twenty years. At the same time, the director questions the role and power of the media, as well as his own approach as a filmmaker. Commander Massoud was killed in an attack in September 2001.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hgt981hu57KuJLPcHIvlRFhRpVm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13830,"logo_path":"/t0pFRwKzrnWouxema1MEBjB53ZG.png","name":"Interscoop","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Massoud the Afghan","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
