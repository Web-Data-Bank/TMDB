UPA – the partisan army – resists their policy. Civil population becomes a hostage of this war \"without rules\", and above all – relatives of the insurgents. Invaders and their allies cruelly torture Ukrainian people, but the struggle continues. Irritated, \"bolshevists\" start evicting people to Siberia. UPA tries to prevent this action, but the forces are not equal... Insurgents can only take revenge and punish the executioners.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b4fhrSgA7hXS1sEjBDBG50HnKU9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152691,"logo_path":"/xmKzksknmaAuXhdWtL4UVYKg1dh.png","name":"Dovzhenko Film Studio","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Executed Dawns","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
