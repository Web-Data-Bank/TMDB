Even in Second Life, where she is anonymous and free to travel to worlds beyond her reach, all she longs for is a secure home. As she searches the virtual universe, Tami encounters a Second-Life house designer, A Nepalese vagabond, and a woman who puts her avatar to bed in Second Life when she goes to bed in real life. Blending Second-Life and real-life footage, this film explores the cultural experience of home in the global village era, and questions the ability to capture “real life”, not only within the virtual world but through the art of film itself.","popularity":1.344,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home in Mind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
