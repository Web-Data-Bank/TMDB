Unique as it's the only film where Franca Valeri (now 90) is the unquestioned star, in the role of Delia, a snobbish, stingy prostitute who is moving to Paris looking for greener and more lucrative pastures. An anti-neorealist, amoral, almost abstract comedy, which anticipates Almod√≥var, a ferocious, though gentle, non-moralistic portrayal of the 60's boom and its broken dreams. The dialogue between Delia and her brother (played by Fiorenzo Fiorentini), when he does (or does not) tell her he is a homosexual, is memorable, a primordial coming-out, a masterpiece of allusions. But what makes it one of the first examples of a film with a \"gay point of view\" is the approach: perceptive, non-conformist, caustically witty. A film ahead of its times, still unbeaten.","popularity":1.151,"poster_path":"/aNAvrFDh2PCRlenzsYvZrqifuyk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ajace Produzioni Cinematografiche","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1962-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris, My Love","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2}
