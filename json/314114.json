There she takes care of an old deaf, dumb and blind man as if he were an insect, a child or a pet. He can’t do anything for himself, so she feeds him and accompanies him on his walks. This strong mutual dependency offers Kaoru an escape from society and allows her to free herself from restrictions imposed by common sense.","popularity":0.634,"poster_path":"/4G8QXZudb8iVwSVeagor7JHgmmi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39804,"logo_path":"/bT7wDgMpeT7EAewYfWIHs3gWNYE.png","name":"AOI Pro.","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":86670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kirishima 1945","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crickets","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
