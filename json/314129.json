The character spends most of her time indoors, isolating herself from the outside world. The film follows the character in an apparent state of hypnagogia. In this deep, relaxed state of consciousness she finds herself unable to distinguish her dreams from reality. This is mirrored in the editing between digital and hi-8 video footage and two differ- ent compositions made from ambient sound recordings. On the threshold of sleep the character appears to temporarily escape from her condition and explore the outside world.\r Watch Here: https://vimeo.com/43363224","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hikikomori","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
