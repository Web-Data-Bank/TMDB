On any weekend, there may be no better place to find out what makes America great than at a flea market. A Flea Market Documentary is an unabashed celebration of the unusual people and the enticing things that can be found in parking lots, fairgrounds, drive-ins, sidewalks, and wherever else someone has posted a sign saying \"Flea Market.\"  It's capitalism mixed with craziness. It's amazing old stuff, great salespeople, the ancient tradition of the open-air market, and the possibility of finding a bargain, all uniting shoppers across the nation.  Produced by WQED Pittsburgh, A Flea Market Documentary travels from the gigantic Rose Bowl Market in Pasadena, California, to the busy but modest- sized Eastern Market in Washington, DC, talking with organizers, vendors, food merchants and shoppers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vUD8N1RHP2Q8V41lpme9E5HuL4d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Flea Market Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
