Then a TV special from the 70's called \"The Weird World of Weird\" where host Ralph Story takes us on a guide through the world of the occult. Next is \"Follow That Skirt\", a short film from 1964 that follows a gender confused man as he strangles and slashes the women he hates. The compilation wraps up with some recently uncovered footage of \"The Smut Peddler\", a lost nudie-cutie from '65 that involves a pervy publisher and a bevy of nude models.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42356,"logo_path":null,"name":"National General Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":42357,"logo_path":null,"name":"Biolane","origin_country":""},{"id":42358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mohawk Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weird World Of Weird","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
