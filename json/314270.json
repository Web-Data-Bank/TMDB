Alpi shows the Alps as a key location, owing to its delicacy and environmental importance, where one can observe and study the complexity of social, economic, and political relationships. Even if the imagery of Alps is still that of a world that is pre-modern, Alpi presents that unique landscape as a laboratory of modernity and its illusions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hhxE9KEHRn983QhxmpW8K9b4lZk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Armin Linke","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alpi","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
