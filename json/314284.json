McCandless' own letters, released for the first time, as well as new and surprising interviews, probe the mystery that still lies at the heart of a story that has become part of the American literary canon and compels so many to this day.","popularity":2.597,"poster_path":"/g2JEEYUma0PJXWBxYJjoEARBQPP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25585,"logo_path":"/eyjGTfjzBlj0nK9JkOtYXh5rOQh.png","name":"Lincoln Square Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":91992,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":191677,"logo_path":"/jVkPAzYbEqLVIJ4SxGTGNQrlytP.png","name":"Coneflower Films Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to the Wild: The Chris McCandless Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10}
