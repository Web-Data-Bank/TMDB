I had a wife who I loved for forty-four years, raised two wonderful children and was a proud grandfather, but something was missing. I had been so concerned with the day to day world that now I felt I needed something to nurture my spiritual side. I chose to walk the 800 kilometers pilgrimage to the burial remains of the Apostle St. James, who was buried in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. This is the story of my journey and the pilgrims I met along the path. The journey was a test of endurance and my will power. But the journey changed my life, I found my faith, I developed a personal relationship with God and just as important opened my eyes to the goodness in humanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Are you a pilgrim?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
