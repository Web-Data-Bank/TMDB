The plague has brutally hit Florence. A group of then young people, seven women and three men, rebel against the feeling of death that is about to swallow them. They flee the city and find refuge in an abandoned villa in the Tuscan hills. Here, between moral doubts and the tasks needed to survive, they kill time by telling each other stories until they will decide to return. The stories are varied - tragic, bizarre, funny or erotic - but common and central to all of them is the female presence.","popularity":6.143,"poster_path":"/woTiRqHTSaXlTDEAQqDjSA5hKYz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stemal Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":28699,"logo_path":"/vCqaf8TwyhBgpHBoCvCkoaGtrON.png","name":"Cinemaundici","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":101485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barbary Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wondrous Boccaccio","video":false,"vote_average":5.882,"vote_count":76}
