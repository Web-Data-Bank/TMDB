While the first installment detailed the follies and foibles of a day in the life of Wanlov the Kubolor and M3NSA, the latest film follows their revenge mission against a gang that ambushed, robbed and left them for dead. The result is eminently entertaining, as uniquely engaging as the music that gives the film its irresistible rhythm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GH","name":"Ghana"}],"release_date":"2014-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coz Ov Moni 2: Fokn Revenge","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
