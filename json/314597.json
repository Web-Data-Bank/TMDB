Gustavo is a wild man living at a nostalgic place yearning for the lost essence of its past. Every night, Gethsemane becomes Gustavo's scene, while he slips into the dark corners of the neighborhood. This film is a contemplation of a shared impermanence, where Gethsemane's debris bears witness of the end of a community, but also of a human being.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing After The Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
