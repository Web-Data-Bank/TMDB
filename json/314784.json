A moody opera that is thematically broad at times and intimately personal in others, \"Khovanshchina\" tells the story of the 17th-century clash between Russian conservatives and Peter the Great's reformists. Among the singers is renowned basso Nicolai Ghiaurov and Paata Burchuladze, as well as Anatoly Kocherga, Ludmila Semtchuk, and Heinz Zednik.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/j8BSpBE6FQHDge4DxIplU4SbWYH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wiener Staatsoper","origin_country":""},{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":173,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Khovanshchina","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
