In the Fabero coal mine, northern Spain, you can see a 520-tonne Hitachi EX5500 hydraulic excavator making light work of overburden. This beast feeds 200-tonne capacity Cat 789C trucks in just three or four passes. Nearby, a Komatsu D475A dozer – the biggest in Europe – is ripping through rock. In footage from mines associated with Fabero you will see other immense hydraulic excavators at work: Komatsu PC3000 and Hitachi EX3600. Among the many supporting machines on view are Komatsu WA800 and WA600 wheeled loaders.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The large, specialised machines in this programme have one task: to move mountains.","title":"Massive Earthmoving Machines Part 4: Mountain Movers","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
