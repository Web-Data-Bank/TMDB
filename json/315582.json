There may be no trophies to show after a thrilling year, but strong foundations have been laid and there have been fond memories created along the way. It was a season to remembers as Claudio Ranieri prepared his group of international superstars for an attack on all fronts. On home soil, the team recorded the most points we have ever attained in the top-flight, with some fine victories along the way, most notably against arch-rivals Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, whilst in Europe, the 4-0 defeat of Lazio in their own back yard, became the biggest win by any foreign club on Italian turf at that time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sVeXZLejqiIDSyP8BGbMpdjzIFF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42697,"logo_path":null,"name":"ILC Prime","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":215,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The World Was Watching","title":"Chelsea FC - Season Review 2003/04","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
