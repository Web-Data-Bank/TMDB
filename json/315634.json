Influenced by the absurd humor of MONTY PYTHON, he was publicly acknowledged by them when they dubbed him \"The Lost Python\". Eddie Izzard is a master of switching between subjects with the most unexpected transitions and an unbridled energy. In his elegant and absurd universe he tells us his version of the history of humanity: from the Stone Age to the modern-day man, from the origins of language to Wikipedia, from banjos to helicopters, or even from the creation of the world to... bananas.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/oWqbCuzqUwJ9inijyqzUvAAHqh9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eddie Izzard - Stripped : Tout en français","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
