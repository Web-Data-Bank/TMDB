Hear the blast of steam whistles, thrill to the blaring of diesel horns, and watch in awe as these titans of the tracks thunder on by. Feel the heat, smell the smoke, and cover your ears because our cameras crews take you up-close and right to where all the action is! It's an unforgettable rail experience you'll watch again and again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/faNHeCK3AQB0EwqicPsCunst35m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marshall Publishing \u0026 Promotions, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Thunder on the Tracks!","title":"Lots & Lots of TRAINS, Vol 2 - Thunder on the Tracks!","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
