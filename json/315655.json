After the wars of 1848, a retired Austrian army officer \"returns to the soil\" as a gentleman farmer in Hungary in the 1850s. The old campaigner is the father of two daughters: One of the girls comes to a sad end thanks to the malfeasances of a handsome spy, but the other has a happier fate when she falls in love with a Hungarian POW. The underlying theme is brotherhood, as the formerly warring Austrians and Hungarians at last find a common ground. Az Uj Foldesur was nearly twice as expensive as the average Hungarian film -- but at $40,000, its budget was a drop in the bucket compared to a typical Hollywood production.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":90035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hirsch and Tsuk","origin_country":""},{"id":7013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hunnia Filmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1935-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Landlord","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
