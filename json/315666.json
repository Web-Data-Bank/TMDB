Brancusi leaves his small village of Hobitza, south of the Carpathian Mountains and walks through Romania, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and parts of France to arrive in Paris, the metropolis of world culture for the first three decades of the 1900s. He walks in spring, summer, winter and autumn, treading the landscape away from the beaten track, experiencing sights, having adventures, suffering hardships, looking, touching and feeling the world as a preparation of what is to come for him.","popularity":0.914,"poster_path":"/3QVkLx8hI07vPRdzhJzbot1tj2P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinatura","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":42922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abis Studi","origin_country":""},{"id":17084,"logo_path":"/gvpnQhxFbQ6afXjzRKt654HPy7y.png","name":"Catherine Dussart Productions (CDP)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":175358,"logo_path":null,"name":"APX Capital Group","origin_country":""},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":160681,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zurich Film Fund","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Walking to Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
