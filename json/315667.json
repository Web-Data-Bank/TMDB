The first half of the film takes place aboard a French cruising ship, steaming through dangerous waters during WWI. Among the passengers is heroine Jeanne (Annabella), who was once in love with first-officer D'Artelles (Robert Vidalin) but he now seems strangely preoccupied. It turns out that the ship is on a secret mission, which ultimately dooms the vessel to a Lusitania-like death. After the sinking, Captain De Corlaix (Victor Francen) faces a court-martial, and it is at this point that the film clarifies several baffling plot points. Despite its complexity, the story is fairly believable, with the exception of the grafted-on romantic subplot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fvSjdhVVbiYEpkdXE1dHxxkvifr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1935-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacrifice of Honor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
