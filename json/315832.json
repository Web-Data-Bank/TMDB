They prefer to use lying, cheating, stealing, or brute force. Take, for instance, the pharmacy student who uses his skils to make date-rape drugs, and he sells these concoctions in order to pay tuition.

Will he find redemption or destruction?","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/3GgIBFl0jcF4uuEY67tT9LdUkMW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Evil Never Felt So Good","title":"Dirtbags","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
