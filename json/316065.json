He and an equally disreputable acquaintance rape a woman alongside the Seine, a crime made all the worse because she is pregnant. The rest of this slow-paced film deals with the consequences of that action.","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/h1mI40UXslkMAtsDs2f5Sm5c5k2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1985-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Insomniac on the Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
