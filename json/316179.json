Her humdrum life is slowly upended as Paul, a ramblin' man from her past, rolls like a tumbleweed through her small town. Pitting grand landscapes against dinners of fried chicken and the roar of V8 engines on Saturday nights, Tired Moonlight explores the relationship between extravagant nature and the tiny mundane moments of small town life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tired Moonlight","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
