Composed of three short movies, Hey, Asshole!, Adam Kesher and You Fucking Dickhead!, The Tony Longo Trilogy brings together all of the actorâ€™s scenes in three of his most memorable films: The Takeover (Troy Cook, 1995), Living in Peril (Jack Ersgard, 1997) and Mulholland Dr. (David Lynch, 2001).","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/qWjKfnFxhztDPSpQmmTQGv82IlA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tony Longo Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
