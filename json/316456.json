The landscape is ruled by the representatives of economy: motorways, cities, industrial parks, wind farms, as well as the hydroelectric power plant commissioned exactly 20 years ago. But something hides among them. A giant alluvial fan with small, island-like villages, forests, wetland fields, reed beds, all of which are encircled by countless small and big watercourses and prongs. This inland delta is unique in Europe, and was created by the Danube coming out of the mountains. But today the river is not as free to move as once. Seeing the grip of the built environment, the question arises: Can the wildlife retain its former richness and beauty?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rhgP0AP2e6mCrvW9n1v6zk86Ssx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155295,"logo_path":null,"name":"NatFilm Hungary Kft.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2013-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vad Szigetköz - A szárazföldi delta","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
