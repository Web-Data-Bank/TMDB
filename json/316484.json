The first one---Sailing\" has young Hattie sailing her boat in a fountain and is quite dismayed when a frog sinks it. She brightens up when a friendly policeman restores it for her. The second unrelated segment---\"The Village Band\"--- features Hamilton Ham in the story of a village band that goes unappreciated by the populace until it is needed to greet a distinguished dignitary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kat76Y8tbtGJn8xayeQGxFFLxJw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1958-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sailing and Village Band","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
