(Not to mention a here-today, gone-tomorrow one; by the end, Sooper Goop is already being outsold by Eatum Sweetum, made from a different grain, but with the same drawbacks.) Kid-friendly, with a lesson easy to understand, and impossible to forget.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sooper Goop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
