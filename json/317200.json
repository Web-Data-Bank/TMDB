Released in the U.S. as The Dynamite Brothers, the film concerns the misadventures of three brothers, musicians all. The story follows the siblings' progress from the conservatory to a desert island to the Venice Carnival. The message is that happiness must be earned, a sugar-coated pill of wisdom that went down easily with the film's youthful fans. Not quite in the Disney league, I Fratelli Dinamite is nonetheless colorful, expertly rendered entertainment.","popularity":1.151,"poster_path":"/8rzWrMddtOrOkUOrrbYRYJ4HXo2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dynamite Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
