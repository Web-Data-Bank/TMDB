One such town was Untidy Gulch, under the control of \"Blackmarket Bromide.\" It's overrun with outlaws who keep shooting their sheriffs. It puts an advertisement in a big-city Eastern newspaper asking for a clean-up man: \"Wanted: Clean-living, clean-thinking, clean-acting man to clean up Untidy Gulch. Must be clean.\" Hector answers the call... he thinks it's just a dirty town that needs sweeping. He grabs his broom and applies for the job. Bromide and his gang are ready for the Eastern gunfighter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Clean-Up","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
