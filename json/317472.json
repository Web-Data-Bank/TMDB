In love with the beautiful Margharita (Lila Lee), Luigi lands a job in the music store owned by the girl's uncle. Ultimately, however, our hero does the Pagliacci act when Margharita evinces a preference for handsome Pasquale (David Rollins). The film's best scene takes place in a nursery full of talented tots, a sequence that undoubtedly reminded Jessel of his days with Gus Edwards' \"Schoolroom\" act. Exercising his droit du seigneur, Georgie Jessel sings the title tune.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/gUQeaESmVgoShEk3vLASLu2Ivdb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love, Live & Laugh","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
