Mighty Mouse, living in a star, watches the universe through a telescope. He observes a home full of mice being terrorized by a cat, so he travels to earth and infiltrates the house in disguise in a trench coat and hat. In an effort to make life miserable for the mean cat, Mighty Mouse drinks the cat's milk, sleeps in his bed, and eventually gets rid of the cat so the three harassed mice can live in peace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rywoxUgQo476WGwtjRklS4gP9Xr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anti-Cats","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
