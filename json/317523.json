Conceived to present the shows of the live album that would be released (Doces Bárbaros - Live), the documentary changed of tone when registering the arrest and judgment of Gilberto Gil and of a companion by possession of drugs. Gil was forced to go to a detox clinic, and only went out to participate in the programmed shows.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l7ObSkRVHtivhnsWVSa4HssVrZJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101469,"logo_path":null,"name":"A e B Produções Cinematográficas","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":101470,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.G.
