When Adam Curry and Timo Nadudvari first learned about the hidden consequences of the genetic engineering of food crops they were shocked and appalled - then they decided they had to tell others what they had learned. The video examines the issue of genetic engineering of food from the real-world perspectives of leading scientists, farmers, food safety advocates and the victims of genetically engineered products. It exposes a heinous scheme by large corporations with long criminal histories to gain control over the world's food supply by infecting food crops with patented DNA. It also exposes Agro-Tech lies, the corruption within the US FDA and the all-to-real risks to human health.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wc7q96rjJZzOQ4yVvVa0I9HAQAj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Seed: The Truth About Our Food","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
