His terrorist group, Wild Seven, stages an attack that levels several buildings in Tokyo on Christmas Day, killing 8000 people. In order for the government to study the benefits of \"teamwork\", the new students work in pairs, with their collars electronically linked so that if one of them is killed, the other dies as well. They must kill Nanahara in three days - or die.","popularity":10.326,"poster_path":"/sKoVS6wVmIY0fCDcJYZZ1y3yOK3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fukasaku-gumi","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":9300,"logo_path":"/9sSD1XufVCJWAadNiC9Mwu994VD.png","name":"TV Asahi","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":157807,"logo_path":"/tyrJOOVAUIxQEJzjP1PhP2H5zFi.png","name":"WOWOW","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":113750,"logo_path":"/A3QVZ9Ah0yI2d2GiXUFpdlbTgyr.png","name":"SEGA","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":9221,"logo_path":"/7hEAueutGnsQUyUGnp5zQ1YmCrO.png","name":"Toei Video Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":121739,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toei Advertising","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":569,"logo_path":"/hOurQBeeFI4OTTdAEtvGflbJgXU.png","name":"Tokyo FM","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nippan Group Holdings","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3656,"logo_path":"/mY6L0bHRp8fNWfICPqLjxp3khvq.png","name":"GAGA Communications","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-07-05","revenue":14902587,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This time it's war.","title":"Battle Royale II: Requiem","video":false,"vote_average":4.927,"vote_count":397}
