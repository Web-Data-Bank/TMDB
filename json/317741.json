Goodnight staged an old-style buffalo hunt, using Indians, led by a 70-hear-old Kiowa named Horse, from the reservation at Fort Sill, Okla. The Wiswall brothers from Denver spent nearly a month shooting the hunt and other footage at the ranch. The resulting film, Old Texas was shown at a cattlemen's association meeting in Denver and was subsequently lost.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Texas","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
