Attell's sarcastic wit and quick-fire delivery prove why he has earned the reputation as a \"comic's comic\" and was dubbed one of the\"25 Funniest People in America\" by Entertainment Weekly. His decidedly adult brand of comedy covers everything including alcohol consumption, dating current events and celebrities, and everything else on his mind.","popularity":1.6,"poster_path":"/sSLewOkdcn8GpdPx20XUl63iaug.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5466,"logo_path":"/1QCiwVMHyYxLtcEd4NGvlQ7cmA4.png","name":"Irwin Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"His pain is your pleasure.","title":"Dave Attell: Captain Miserable","video":false,"vote_average":5.769,"vote_count":13}
