Dan Cruickshank charts the rise of Sir George Gilbert Scott to the very heights of success, the fall of his son George Junior and the rise again of his grandson Giles. It is a story of architects bent on a mission to rebuild Britain. From the Romantic heights of the Midland Hotel at St Pancras station to the modern image of Bankside power station (now Tate Modern), this is the story of a family that shaped the Victorian age and left a giant legacy.","popularity":0.85,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12935,"logo_path":"/rml1bBbFJ33HE0rTrkNpuFVfpAQ.png","name":"BBC Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":43927,"logo_path":null,"name":"The British Library","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dan Cruickshank and the Family That Built Gothic Britain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
