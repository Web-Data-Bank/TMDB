I am interested in a creative geography of the city I've constructed. For instance, the front of the hotel is from Berlin, its interior was photographed in Copenhagen. The film offers the elliptical “scent” of espionage films (largely because of its Berlin locations) and offers that genre’s lubricating sense of voyeurism, danger, and sexuality. My source materials are Mexican comic-book figures, and these urban photos I snapped on my honeymoon with my wife Janie Geiser in the summer of 1996.” —Lewis Klahr","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1vflZ4G7shGjF5LqmgojpnYLLCh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Occidental Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
