Co-founder of both organization Gay Men's Health Crisis and the direct action protest group ACT UP, Kramer was vilified by some who saw his criticism to be an expression of self-hatred, while lionized by others who credit him with waking up the gay community — and, eventually, the government and medical establishment — to the devastation of the disease.","popularity":1.443,"poster_path":"/xsVY9QPCPpbFv0vNKo9JAjLOn5t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He took on a cause and inspired a revolution","title":"Larry Kramer In Love & Anger","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":9}
