In this film, Joe Gibbons plays a fictionalized version of himself as he discovers a roomful of Super 8 footage from his own life, detailing events he can no longer recall. This footage shows his earlier film experiments, his descent into destructive behavior, and his “bottoming out” on drugs and alcohol. At a certain point, the films are replaced by random photos, police records, and psychiatric hospital records.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hr8SB9nrUhfbjGIo36JDyEMXkFF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confessions of a Sociopath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
