For many, the all-important bonds they share as a couple are what enable the next generation to survive. But can we call these bonds love? In this delightful, provocative look at the love life of animals, we see the feminine wiles of a young gorilla, the search for Mr. Right among a thousand flamingos, the open “marriages” of blue-footed boobies, the soap opera arrangements of gibbons, and all the subtle, outrageous, romantic antics that go into finding a partner. These are love stories all right, as various and intriguing as the lovers themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1fd53UCxtLAItNI5jMtVetFuw6v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15964,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nature: Love in the Animal Kingdom","video":true,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2}
