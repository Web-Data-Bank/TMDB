This film depicts the struggle of modern man to choose between bachelorhood and marriage. A sensitive yet comical look at love and commitment between men and women in the '90s. Chronicling the lives of a typical yuppie couple, Charcoal (Lau Ching-Wan) and Veronica (Ron for short) (Anita Yuen). Anita's goal in life is to have a baby, which certainly is not Charcoal's goal. Anita's best friend Ada (Lai Mei-Han) and her husband (Dayo Wong) are having a baby at the same time. However, Dayo surprisingly is a womanizer which leads to problems between the couple. In addition, Charcoal's ex-fiance Joyce (Annabelle Hui) is always around the corner.","popularity":0.99,"poster_path":"/vogBUvkyx3xsw1aDqf25ps5jeqp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44177,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Filmmakers Organisation (UFO)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1994-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I've Got You, Babe!!!","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
