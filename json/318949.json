Here in the 60s and 70s a series of archaeological digs revealed the remains of a substantial settlement of over 70 houses of which 8 have been reconstructed. The earliest remains go back as far as 420 B.C., coinciding with a period during which the Roman legions withdrew from Britain, leaving it open to the Anglo-Saxon invasions. The village was settled until 650 AD, the age of Beowulf, when a poem was composed and recited by the bards. Hose Lance Alexander is the acknowledged expert in this field.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":44260,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTSMAGIC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life in the Age of Beowulf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
