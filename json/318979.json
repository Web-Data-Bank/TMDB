She loves the lazy, immobile lump of fur in a way that only cat lovers can, and which is a mystery to us normal people. She pets it, she croons to it, she makes it play the piano --- 'presumably \"Kitten on the Keys\" and Max just hates it. Max is all reaction takes in this one and up to his usual standards, including one great gag to round off the picture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1913-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max Hates Cats","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
