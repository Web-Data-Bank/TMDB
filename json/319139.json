At eighty-seven, he is one of the pioneers of cinema in Africa. He has recently lost his sight but still continues to film life in Sudan as no one before him. Through his oeuvre, Gadalla reveals to us a Sudan both mysterious and misunderstood. Despite censorship and lack of financial support over sixty years, he has produced cinema that is independent and unique in a country where freedom of expression is a rare luxury.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SD","name":"Sudan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema in Sudan: Conversations with Gadalla Gubara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
