With striking visuals and a remarkable soundtrack the film records the technological and agricultural accomplishments of the pioneers and extols the idea of a socialist Jewish state. Footage includes shots taken at the Jaffa port and on various kibbutzes of the time; Lerski's expressive style creates an almost mythic image of the Jew in Palestine, toiling and triumphing amidst the sweeping desert landscape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1936-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avodah","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
