Like most of the early work of the writers, David Hare and Howard Brenton, committed radical (if not revolutionary) socialists throughout the 1970s, it is a satirical attack on capitalist greed and corruption, full of savage, and often disturbing, humour.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/3hqubrK74Br9JTpOLXJ4lX3cmoj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brassneck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
