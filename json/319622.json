In these three cities and two love affairs guide a homosexual man on his nightly search for lost beauty. In a cross between a diary and a baroque play the film reconstructs the fragments of a fateful journey against a Caravaggio backdrop. Painting, sensuality, losing oneself in a cityscape: the Leçons de ténèbres form an obscure fresco, a white-hot collage of trashy vanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c0LQvxWMGwcjBMFAG9R7ZvmGiDn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tenebrae Lessons","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
