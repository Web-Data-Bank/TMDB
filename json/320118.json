He is the creator of more than a hundred works, several of which form part of the repertories of some of the greatest dance centres in the world. Due to the choreographer's extreme reluctance to engage in a documentary, this film is exceptional. For the first time one can have a real close look at Kylian's life, his way of thinking and his most significant creations. The film was shot in Den Haag, Prague, Monte-Carlo and Paris.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/UTS7CkoQhZ7dK6Srx3kddDYQq1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jiri Kylian: Forgotten Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
