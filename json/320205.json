He named it Fallingwater. It, perhaps more than any other building, exemplifies Wright's concept of 'Organic Architecture,' which seeks to harmonize people and nature by integrating the building, the site, and its inhabitants into a unified whole. And today, the iconic image of the house over the waterfall, remains a testament to a great architect working at the height of his career.  Highlights include interviews with Fallingwater director Lynda Waggoner and architectural historian Richard Cleary, who explain Wright's concept of \"organic architecture\" and the qualities that make the structure so exceptional.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hWAGCz9knXOc7ZrznflV5F6dmee.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
