What happens when a wayward young woman needs to hear the sweet story of the Prodigal Son, and the only folks who love her enough to tell it are the players in a bluegrass band she once deserted? On an autumn afternoon in Appalachia, the Potluck Social String Band takes a break from their concert in the park and weaves the timeless tale of redemption and forgiveness around their former bandmate with the strings of guitars, banjos, fiddles, bass, and mandolin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Take The Mountain Down","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
