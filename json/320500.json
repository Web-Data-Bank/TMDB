This area is on Navajo land, and to some of the older Navajos, entering this place was similar to entering a cathedral. Enjoy watching 30 minutes of vibrant photographs being displayed one after the other. In some of the pictures, the twist and turns of the walls make out interesting objects. We found eleven: a chief, laughing bear, mask, python, screaming bear, lioness, singing worm, Egyptian cobra, wolf, and a man in the moon. See if you can find them and others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serenity Channel - Antelope Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
