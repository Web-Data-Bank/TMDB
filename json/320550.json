After a therapy session, she quits her job to the surprise of her family and Brad, and goes into the detective business, opening her own private-eye office. Unfortunately, the ghost of the private-eye who owned the office still lingers and Elizabeth's the only one who can see or hear him. At first, she becomes an unwilling partner in Nick Peyton's unfinished investigation, but then she finds herself falling for the salty, but dead, guy.","popularity":1.37,"poster_path":"/4iO1z63zZTCvJj3RiqPIjcX5MV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15289,"logo_path":null,"name":"Konigsberg/Sanitsky Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Can Be Murder","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
