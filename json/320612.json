Music:Jin Wang. In making the film noir drama The Fifth Night, Yang used different lenses for each camera, but filmed everything at the same moment, creating a labyrinthine, live-feed effect. The work recalls the narrative structure of a traditional Chinese hand-scroll, while its multiple perspectives are suggestive of an M. C. Escher drawing. The synchronous scene was captured in a single take, with the work running for 10 minutes and 37 seconds, the exact length of a reel of film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1BdyFMzGaPufEOyfgVvidw21XXD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fifth Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
