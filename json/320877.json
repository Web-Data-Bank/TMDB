On the 4th of May, Mikael and Andrew parted ways with the Three Amigos leaving them to hit the (wrong side) of the road with weary eyes in their all-American GMC SUV.  They travelled through Nevada to the Grand Canyon, with a side trip of nearly 4 hours to the Meteor site around 43 miles east of Flagstaff. In subsequent days, they travelled through Monument Valley, Durango, Buena Vista, Colorado Springs, Santa Fe, Lincoln, Roswell, Tyler, Lubbock, Austin, Mesquite before finally arriving in New Orleans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":44732,"logo_path":null,"name":"It's About Bloody Time Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An epic journey, with an average outcome","title":"Big In The USA","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":1}
