In \"I Liked His Old Stuff Better\" Kinane chooses to marvel rather than rue such experiences as falling in the shower and receiving pickled eggs as a token of love. It is his second special for Comedy Central.","popularity":1.22,"poster_path":"/yNXFyz4HyOb7Dg7hiOdYYKfX4oP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44739,"logo_path":"/4CMZiCxG8R7U0Lh31AThkQtMdTv.png","name":"Thank You, Brain!
