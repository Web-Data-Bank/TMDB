During their eventful pilgrimage the carefree fun-loving (and seeking) protagonists encounter a mixed bag of folks who include a perky middle-aged lady who wrecks cars for a living, two sexy swinging babes, a friendly farmer, and a hotshot aspiring motocross rider teen who challenges Dancer to a race. This latter episode ends in tragedy, with the kid taking a fatal spill off his bike. So the kid's gung-ho militant gun fanatic father decides to hunt Dancer and Mitchell down in his sinister souped-up truck.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/exxMXYg2waO2k3Gp9BfEnv55J4g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"If you can handle the action, it's a great ride","title":"A Great Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
