While set against the backdrop of a little-known fetish in the swinging lifestyle called 'cuckolding', The Cuckold tells the broader story of two suburban couples and two urban men whose lives collide in a tale woven together by the threads of deceit, lust, and primal vengeance. It also explores the consequences and risks in looking beyond the skin in search of love.","popularity":17.884,"poster_path":"/jVmPxOzuWfxY93MSsSq1qnbNDeF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"You can't hide from desire","title":"The Cuckold","video":false,"vote_average":1.2,"vote_count":4}
