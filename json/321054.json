In fact that is what it is about, the quality of meaninglessness of living in a place that turns people into zombies. In a place where meaning must be invented, these kids turn into the only place, the only culture they see worth tuning into: television and movies. Thus they slowly degenerate into the abysmal reinterpretation in a sort of sickening anti-hero, anti-social statements that goes absurdly a wrong turn.","popularity":0.684,"poster_path":"/1RfmdrOnQlbe49Q4vbnB6aFVwFR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90356,"logo_path":null,"name":"Day For Night Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1998-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kuldesak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
