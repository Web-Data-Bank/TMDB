This forces his editor Claudia Wesskampe, who hates the Mediterranean on account of her absent Italian stepfather, to join Kai to finish the field work, as he's already dangerously close to her deadline. Friendly locals like padre Leo Muti and his flirtatious cousin Luca soon convert her to appreciate the country, its people and even her unraveled family history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/32BR0PlqbLf03NrAKb3R32mpJhK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein Sommer in Amalfi","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
