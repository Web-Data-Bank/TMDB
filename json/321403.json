That spring was the second time since 1990 that a group of Czech tourists set foot in the DPRK. The film follows twenty-seven Czechs who have decided to spend approximately 2,600 Euros on a sightseeing tour of a country which cultivates a cult of personality, maintains concentration camps for its citizens and doesn't hide its development of nuclear weapons. Foreign visitors are only allowed a view of a carefully prepared illusion, thoroughly supervised by \"guides\". What is more, the North Korean system is starkly reminiscent of our own past. Which emotions do our travellers experience: sympathy, nostalgia or, in contrast, happiness that \"we already have this behind us\"? How does a Czech person, after being accustomed to eighteen years of freedom and democracy, come to terms with the directives and restrictions of a totalitarian system?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/okZuVbM20jr7NrMcUbvX0HyL2bF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4595,"logo_path":null,"name":"Negativ","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":6107,"logo_path":null,"name":"HBO Česká republika","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2009-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome to North Korea!","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":8}
