Barring their way is a river--crossable only by means of a ferry barge. The barge operator, Travis, refuses to be bullied into providing transport for the gang and escapes across river with most of the local populace--leaving Remy and his gang behind, desperately seeking a way across. A river-wide stand-off begins between the gang and the townspeople, both groups of which have left people on the wrong side of the river.","popularity":6.055,"poster_path":"/rUtpoLVAPNB3pYbgSFYnxLClKof.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1347,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aubrey Schenck Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How much is enough?","title":"Barquero","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":38}
