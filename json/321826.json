While canned Muzak plays, a scrolling text denounces the corporate masquerade of commercial television to reveal the structure of profit that greases the wheels of the media industry. Television emerges as little more than a insidious sponsor for the corporate engines of the world. By appropriating the medium he is criticizing—using television, in effect, against itself—Serra employs a characteristic strategy of early, counter-corporate video collectives—a strategy that remains integral to video artists committed to a critical dismantling of the media’s political and ideological stranglehold.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Television Delivers People","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
