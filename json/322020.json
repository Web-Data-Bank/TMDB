Though it could easily hold its own against the Allied forces' tanks, the Panzer III met its match on the Eastern Front against the Russian T-34. By the end of the war, it had been shifted to secondary fronts and was often used as a command tank rather than on the main battlefield.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6y9aoiHYDwiBf9Zgrzhle1fhUqP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Magic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panzer III: Medium Tank","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
