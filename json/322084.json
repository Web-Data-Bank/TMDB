Young recruits engage in simulated combat training, which barely differs from video games produced as entertainment. Footage is included from a workshop demonstrating the use of computer re-enactments in the psychological care of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. As a large-scale installation, Serious Games critically focuses on the role of audiovisual culture in the spectacle of war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mVzuRkmLB5PtaE4XRUTQHTq33Ld.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serious Games 1–4","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
