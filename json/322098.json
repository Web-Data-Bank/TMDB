This is the realization of a social project, conceived by Judge John Targino, in which the children of one of the most violent neighborhoods of Recife - the \"Coque\" - receive music and instruments lessons, forming a classical music orchestra. The first part of the documentary features interviews with many parents, talking about their experiences and how the project has changed their lives, not only of their children, but their own. Then, in the second part, we have interviews with the students themselves and watch part of the preparations for the concert commemorating the anniversary of the orchestra - and, of course, all anxiety and expectation that this moment brings to their lives. Finally, in the third part, the concert is shown almost entirety. The kids brilliantly perform orchestral pieces of J. S. Bach, E. Elgar and H. Villa-Lobos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2012-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sons da Esperança","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
