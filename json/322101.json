Mr van den Heuvel, a cobbler, lives with his wife and two small children in a one-room hovel in a dingy alley. He wants to work, but is usually too tired and is continuously coughing. He ignores the advice of his doctor to go to a health centre. His little daughter, Annetje, is not well either. At school she is listless, never wanting to play with her classmates. A visiting school doctor examines the girl and gives her a note for her parents, advising them to consult their doctor. Father considers this as nonsense.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xR3oL7r07MKEy6nL14JWadH1pTm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Clouds the Sun Is Shining","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
