A group of researchers appear to have made contact with an entity by the name of Philip. It is possible that Philip was not really a ghost and that the strange events were just the result of manifestations from group consciousness. Maybe it was all just the result of psychokinesis or a big trick the researchers played on themselves. At the core of the investigation are belief, immortality and science.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conjuring Philip","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
