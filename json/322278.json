When six years have passed since the night he made a bargain with a mysterious stranger, he comes face-to-face with the end of his life, when opposing spiritual entities begin a battle for his soul. In a 'Christmas Carol'-like sequence of events, Walter Evans is taken through the events of his life and shown, episode by episode, the depravity into which he has fallen. When it seems there is no hope left for the wretched soul and the devil believes he has won, the man's guardian angel pulls a trick out of his sleeve to give Walter another chance at life and salvation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Will Rest in Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
