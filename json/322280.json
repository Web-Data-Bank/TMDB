The footage was captured at iconic concert venue Dan’s Silverleaf in Midlake’s hometown of Denton, TX, where the band had stopped off to play a local show while on tour promoting their fourth album Antiphon which was released November 5, 2013. The result is a beautifully photographed 90 minute film that is both a live concert film and documentary homage to the band’s hometown of Denton, TX. 2004 was also the year that Noren filmed “Way Out East!\", a video release for Lee’s Stereo Skateboard company featuring songs from Midlake's debut album Bamnan and Slivercork.
