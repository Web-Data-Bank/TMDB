Three men who have killed and three families who have lost a beloved one.  In the common idea of guilt and punishment this makes three who get punished and three who are meant to forget. Unthinkable to imagine the two sides will ever get closer. The film tells three times the impossible story: To meet your enemy - in thoughts, in messages, in real life.  A film that challenges our ideas of guilt and punishment.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/6qxnaiMzaq9KGfaK6XiAZreqSXp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59360,"logo_path":null,"name":"Docdays Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":54287,"logo_path":null,"name":"S.U.M.O.
