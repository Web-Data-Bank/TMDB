It follows four real-life adult film performers as they start their day at home, get in their cars and drive to work in a nondescript residential house in the San Fernando Valley in Southern California. In between documentary scenes, we also encounter several fictional characters whose stories revolve around the same residential house where the performers work. Shown as a grid of four simultaneous images, the film weaves scenes of everyday life with moments of beauty, as well as the strange and absurd moments of apparent convergence.","popularity":1.342,"poster_path":"/r0NMNlUh3pBw7jpwOxzLWCoJs7B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17178,"logo_path":"/eXbcwmrHmVmgmRFPoYZfbLkt884.png","name":"Filmgalerie 451","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything That Rises Must Converge","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":2}
