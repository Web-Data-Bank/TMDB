He is one metre forty nine tall, has only one eye, one leg shorter than the other and his hands and feet are deformed. Antoine is bald and over forty, he is grossly overweight, has psychological problems and a dysfunctional family background. Mourad and Antoine form one of the most bizarre drag queen duos that has ever performed on European stages. They are the fabulous BayBjane and Cybersissy, undisputed divas of nights in Ibiza. A human and artistic union, a mix of freak show, kitsch and clowning, cyber and s/m, provocation and irony, Lindsay Kemp and Leigh Bowery, Divine and Bette Davis. After seeing one of their shows in a club in Cologne, Tim Lienhard tells us what is hidden under the heavy makeup and the gaudy dresses of these unique characters. Their brilliant crazy creativity has helped them to overcome many problems in their two difficult lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Zero One: The Story of Cybersissy & BayBjane","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
