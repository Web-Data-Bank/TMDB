He feels as if he has woken from a dream, a dream lived in Vallecas, a working-class neighborhood in Madrid. His childhood is over. His mother and sister have dedicated their lives to him; now, although convinced of his innocence, they are powerless. His lawyer Marcelo - another son of El Barrio - is reluctant to take the case, happier to sever all ties with his secret past and a love long lost.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/5sjwMUXYXT60sR6FYiFCsqj5BID.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":357,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vía Digital","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":7680,"logo_path":"/uGcInOaHyvFZ337T5OeQKKVjSCJ.png","name":"Tornasol Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2000-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Side","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
