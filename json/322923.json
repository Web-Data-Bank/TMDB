Each role embodies an archetype (the harried director who has a deadline to meet, the Scrooge production manager who has a budget to meet, and the writers who are above these mundane concerns), and these personalities drive the working actors over the edge until they decide to lock them up and do their own thing -- happiness can be just around the corner if you are in the driver's seat. Hopefully, the actors will be able to bow out before the police catch on to the situation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Qu'est-ce qu'on attend pour être heureux!","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
