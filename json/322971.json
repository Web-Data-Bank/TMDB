Can the filmmaker's family accept that he is more interested choosing to document a famine that happened 50 years ago than choosing a wife? Will the family continue to farm their land and grow rice as they always have or sell it to developers? How can they adapt to life in modern China when the country itself is in the midst of identity crisis? The film explores these topics and more in a refreshingly original style that bridges the gap between documentary and narrative feature while providing a delightfully intimate portal into family life in modern China.","popularity":1.344,"poster_path":"/7PkhFeu7EMojO9zEuJtJ1yom51r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unseal Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gleaners","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
