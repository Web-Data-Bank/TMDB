Nabokov's themes of power and delusion, doubling and gameplay are anchored in Sutcliffe's collage through a prismatic treatment of visual material and sound.  Sutcliffe quotes a parade of society portraits, photocopied handouts from a lecture series entitled 'Theories of Montage,' and Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1978 adaptation of the novel in a dense sequence punctuated by baroque music composed by Jean-Baptiste Lully for the seventeenth century French king, Louis XIV.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Despair","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
