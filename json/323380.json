She promotes feminism and laments a shift in the men from self-defense to aggression. Her friend, Else Lasker-Schuler (1869 - 1945), expressionist poet and German Jew, is in Berlin, writing, caring for her son, watching Hitler's movement take power. She goes to Jerusalem and imagines a park for Arab and Jew. Her poems, voiced from within, capture her experience. The film meditates on the violence at the root of Israel's birth: of the Nazis and of the Zionists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transfax Film Productions","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":30983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agav Films","origin_country":""},{"id":181,"logo_path":"/zhQ77XOviCBuXd74IurqqjgLNe0.png","name":"Channel Four Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":13413,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hubert Bals Fund","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":54900,"logo_path":"/yCYeqZosRZFwBNJK4clARa3E4la.png","name":"Nederlandse Omroepstichting (NOS)","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin-Jerusalem","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
