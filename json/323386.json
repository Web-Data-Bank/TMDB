In the midst of a nationwide crisis, a group of politicians found an opposition party to the military regime, triggering violent denunciation against multinationals operating in the country. The explorer of the Seesaw deposit, United Mining, an American multinational that is being accused of several irregularities, sees in the internal struggle that divides the opposition party its only chance to silence the nationalist campaign that denounces it. Thus, a game is developed that ends up leading the characters to a tragic plot of corruption and fear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xaCuhEpfmVekx6NVgXiC0op0Z2g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1981-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memórias do Medo","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
