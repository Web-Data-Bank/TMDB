Half a century ago Andriessen vowed he would never compose for a symphony orchestra again. But, against all the odds and after much deliberation, he has agreed to do so. The occasion is the Concertgebouw Orchestra’s 125th jubilee year concert and the commission is a present from the Concertgebouw to the orchestra.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cobos Films BV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imperfect Harmony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
