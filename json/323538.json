He grew up in a patriarchal family with his mother, father and two siblings. Home life was strict and regimented, his father was clearly the master of the house. But as a devout Jehovahs Witness, this was hardly out of the ordinary. On the surface, Donalds youth would resonate with anyone raised in the slow-paced sanctity of a small town. Years later, Donald would reveal a sad tale of survival, struggle and strife in his book, A Fathers Touch, his memoirs about enduring years of sexual abuse at the hands of his father, subsequently retold in this documentary Family Secrets, When Nobody's Looking.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Secrets: When Nobody's Looking","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
