These films were produced in a dark era of racial discrimination and racism in America, and frankly, the films are quite appalling. However, they are vital educational resources about WWII and the history of racism. We have collected these prejudiced propaganda films and digitized them with the intention of spreading these visual resources worldwide at a low cost, so anyone can learn about cultural diversity, racial and religious discrimination, national origin discrimination and racial prejudice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Historic Japanese Prejudice & Racism Films","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
