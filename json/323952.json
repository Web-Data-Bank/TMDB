Sivakumar falls in love with Jayachitra. However, things take a turn to the worse in the typical Balachander style when Jayachitra sacrifices herself to the whims of a playboy, played by Kamal Haasan in order to save her friend (Jayasudha) from his exploits. What happens next, who marries whom, is the crux of a dramatic climax. The movie turns the entire concept of romantic movies by its head - the concept being that the hero does not always have to get the girl.","popularity":0.881,"poster_path":"/3jRmVIxIyX1tw5Ttz4q6jOlKTXj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45968,"logo_path":null,"name":"Udhaya Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1973-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sollathaan Ninaikkiren","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
