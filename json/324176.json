His new order leads the strict and incorruptible record watcher to the Finnish island of Föglö. There is said to be a boy there who can make a stone jump 52 times on the water. Marvin does not have a great desire for the arduous journey, and when the twelve-year-old Elias barely fails in his attempt to set a record, he wants to leave immediately. However, Marvin did not count on the shrewd islanders who want to give the life-threatening boy a second chance - especially Elias' aunt Fanny.","popularity":0.683,"poster_path":"/urEfKgArnuRIKZdyLh9AVRU6P8B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Rekordbeobachter","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
