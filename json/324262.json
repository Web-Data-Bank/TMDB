Equal parts science, history and visual essay, “Bounce” removes us from the scandals and commercialism of today's sports world to uncover the true reasons we play ball, helping us reclaim our universal connection to the ball games we love.","popularity":1.169,"poster_path":"/iAsBa7Df0nGLMmFG22C9DVD0qtZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48273,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bounce Group","origin_country":""},{"id":26403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wrecking Crew","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2015-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bounce: How the Ball Taught the World to Play","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
