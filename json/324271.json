After the regime fell from power in 2001, a fledgling free press emerged and a photography revolution was born. Now, as foreign troops and media withdraw, Afghanistan is left to stand on its own and so are its journalists. Set in a modern Afghanistan bursting with color and character, FRAME BY FRAME follows four Afghan photojournalists navigating a dangerous media landscape as they reframe Afghanistan for the world, and for themselves. Through cinema vérité, powerful photojournalism, and never-before-seen footage shot in secret during the Taliban regime, the film connects an audience with four humans in the pursuit of the truth.","popularity":0.735,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26693,"logo_path":null,"name":"CoPilot Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":48383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Reel","origin_country":""},{"id":48384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rake Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Reframing a nation.","title":"Frame by Frame","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
