Instead of money the teenagers have a stash of grass waiting for a buyer. Food? Nothing wrong with the leftovers from other peopleâ€™s plates. Tent? Why bother when you can sleep under the stars. Sleep? No way: the party goes on all night. V is a pretty girl who knows how to use her charms to the best advantage. Betty, more reserved and shy, never quite knows what to do with her hands, how to hold a cigarette, what to say to the boys they meet. But the tables are turned when the pair go their separate ways after an argument.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2015-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Entry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
