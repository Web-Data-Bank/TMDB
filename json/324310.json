It follows him all the way from the rural Ivory Coast to East Hampton, Long Island, where he bargains for a sale. The film shows how (through occasionally hilarious and frequently fantastic tales about the art objects) he adds economic value and changes the \"meaning\" of what he sells by interpreting and mediating between the cultural values of African producers and Western consumers.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/4xcXIMEiNfRiNytxq5x1hDziehQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In and Out of Africa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
