In 1969, it created Lastan. For hundreds of thousands of children Lastan was a mythical hero who helped unhappy and confused little souls. Each child imagined him differently and felt confident to share with him what they could not confess to anyone else: Dear Lastan, I kissed him, am I pregnant?; Dear Lastan, I fell in love with a boy from my class... For decades Lastan was a legend and the best kept secret in journalism. This film, for the first time after almost five decades, reveals his true identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iOzSBg3UTRpb0VbW6vWynp7rGoB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artizana Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2014-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Lastan!","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
