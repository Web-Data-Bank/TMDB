Filmed 12 years apart, the 1958 concert features Dizzy working eloquently within the small combo structure of a quintet including such influential musicians as sax player Sonny Stitt and bassist Ray Brown. The second show focuses on a completely different side of Dizzy, fronting the legendary Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band. With a 16-piece big band to conduct, including two drummers, his Latin influences are revealed on \"Con Alma\" and \"Manteca.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dizzy Gillespie Live in Belgium 1958 & Live in Denmark 1970","title":"Jazz Icons: Dizzy Gillespie Live in '58 & '70","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
