Inconsequent copulation of the straight and the elliptical. Body forms showing their useless beauty, showing that their function is as transmitters of time. Reluctantly, the forms stalk sulkily into light, great nostalgia for the night stillness.

The grotesque lies in the value broken graven images over your actual throb.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meat of Other Times","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
