This is a participatory film: Villagers from all around the country take the camera in their hands to document what they have gone through during and after the Khmer Rouge era. Through sharing their stories with the young generation, survivors are breaking 30 years of silence and initiating a powerful discourse about the challenges of the present. The big screen under the trees becomes a public space for confrontation, a picture of hope beyond this film.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Want (U) to Know","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
