He spends his days drawing marvellous works with his crayons, depicting human and fantastic beings, fauna, flora, his own inner visions, mystical themes and sex, with a trace of impressive primitivism and beauty. The film registers his daily life.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":"/vsbmSCexD7mS0PWwHqsXMTFBLi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2006-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moacir Art Brut","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
