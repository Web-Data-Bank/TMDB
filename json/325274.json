Pulling from Sun Tzu's 'Art of War,' two brilliant and fierce media barons slug it out over the airwaves: Richard Fairbanks, who owns a 50,000 watt radio behemoth, versus Don Burden, the young upstart broadcasting impresario who swaggers into town and launches the glitzy, promotion-oriented, though low-powered, WIFE-AM 1310. How was the war fought? What were the strategies? Who were the personalities both in the limelight and behind the scenes? And who, in the end, would win the Naptown Rock Radio Wars?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naptown Rock Radio Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
