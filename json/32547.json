Less than twenty years later, the Argentinians have lost literally everything: major national companies have been sold well below value to foreign corporations; the proceeds of privatizations have been diverted into the pockets of corrupt officials; revised labour laws have taken away all rights from employees; in a country that is traditionally an important exporter of foodstuffs, malnutrition is widespread; millions of people are unemployed and sinking into poverty; and their savings have disappeared in a final banking collapse. The film highlights numerous political, financial, social and judicial aspects that mark out Argentina's road to ruin.","popularity":0.911,"poster_path":"/g1RSkJbZsPzoaabp7VtCSi7lI9F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2901,"logo_path":null,"name":"ADR Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinesur","origin_country":""},{"id":8472,"logo_path":"/1W54BW7b0KZW0QoU55OPr9Sjde5.png","name":"Thelma Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2004-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Social Genocide","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":15}
