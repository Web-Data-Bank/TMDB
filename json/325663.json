Think South Pacific, candy-colored, rum-infused cocktails with names like the Shrunken Skull and the Missionary's Downfall, crazy Hawaiian shirts, exotica music, and a nonstop party scene inhabited by self-styled nonconformists. That was then. Today, tiki has been embraced by a coast-to-coast underground hipster subculture of former punk rockers, vintage junkies, and escapists. Featuring historians and hula dancers, master mixologists, mermaids, and more, Plastic Paradise is your ticket to this little-known, fascinating scene, including a pilgrimage to the famed Mai-Kai Restaurant in Fort Lauderdale for Hukilau, an annual anything goes celebration that draws Polynesian popsters from all over the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plastic Paradise: A Swingin' Trip Through America's Polynesian Obsession","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
