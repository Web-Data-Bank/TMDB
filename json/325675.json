The simple filming style, in which neither the camera nor the protagonist ever leaves her flat, results in an unusually intense and extremely personal record of time passing and the relationship with a loved one. It's a raw yet formal testament that sensitively manages to avoid any trace of sentimental kitsch, leading the viewer on an emotional journey of the everyday reality of Bunina's days and her mercilessly worsening physical and psychological condition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xCgugCIfHWVny35e2OlrKuDzz1G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A last year in 114 minutes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
