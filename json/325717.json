Hell Hath No Fury is a balls-out horror anthology that is a bloody and erotic mix of stories in the style of the horror-lit anthologies. The Hot Blood Series and comedic horror shows like Tales form the Crypt. Spiced with liberal -and very gory- doses of wicked inspiration from classic revenge films like Ms. 45, I Spit on Your Grave, Irreversible, and Last House on the Left, Creepy Six Films' Hell Hath No Fury is a funny, sexy, gory, disturbing and exciting ride into an insanely twisted world where the women scorned exact their vengeance like never before.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/liATpQdnwA8xkYQ1KiOaIw2ws32.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4708,"logo_path":"/k1zjOZ0GIZ1dxGerINlXC3lGAqh.png","name":"Brain Damage Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell Hath No Fury","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":2}
