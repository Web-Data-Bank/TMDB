Her mother's evasiveness becomes a crucible that forces her to break away and claim total independence -- but Mini cannot stop until she knows the answer to the question of who her father is. Having no other choice, her mother confides to Mini about her father. This sends Mini on a journey that leads to a chance encounter with a stranger -- who helps her accept those things she cannot change. Through this meeting, Mini finally comes to grips with her own -- and her mother's -- journey. -  Jay Disney, Quincey Krull, Jennifer Sall","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Hug","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
