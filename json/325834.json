These songs are the roots of Estoniaâ€™s renowned singing culture. Based on the continuous repetition of eight-syllable verses, they produce a haunting sound able to connect the fleeting present with the eternal circle of life. Against the stunning setting of modern Estonia, this film explores how Regi songs still fire the imagination today, weaving together people and nature through song.","popularity":1.161,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2011-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regilaul - Songs of the Ancient Sea","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
