It's a very raw view into what drives these friends, and why someone might have committed murder. This ultra-low budget film is shot completely in real time and with a single camera move. There is a bit of strong language, adult situations, and very mild violence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2AzbUiwQ3tbOyw50Krv2tEprgrY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Died","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
