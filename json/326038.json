The film is in two chapters. The first chapter consists of an impression of Maria Semionovna, scenes of the colours of summer time: hay–making, bathing in a river, work in the flax fields and a holiday in the Crimea. The second chapter, set nine years later, is in black and white and deals with how Maria Semionovna's life ended. The mood is one of a sad and elegiac narration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iKqXWvYoH3AR9fpn3S58RTVKrMC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leningrad Documentary Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":21978,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1988-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":12}
