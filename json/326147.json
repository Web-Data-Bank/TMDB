Recital is a highly structured film. Each section involves a woman, situated in some external local, reading a letter or other text. It is clear that the women are not the authors of what they read. The first text is a letter expressing the pain of unrequited love, the abyss of frustrated passion, however read in a monotone with no peaks of feeling. This pattern of love letter reading is repeated with several other readers: one breaks up laughing when she comes to a passage: 'Oh, yes, I love you, I love you.' Clearly the subject is not one of true comedy, particularly since the letters recited are ones Beroes once earnestly composed. Beroes' goal, however, is a kind of distanced deconstruction of the experience, in an attempt to view it with the lessons of knowledge and time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wAP9Wm0SMq9L9i3oMBx4cyaXhvd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recital","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
