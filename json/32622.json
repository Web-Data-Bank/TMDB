Precocious, to say the least, Angela has visions of Lucifer coming to take her and her sister away, and one of her remedies for this is for them to remain within a circle of their dolls and toys until they see a vision of the virgin Mary come to them. But such thinking can only lead to an ending befitting of her own mental state.","popularity":2.265,"poster_path":"/fhxU3jFzC2tlBgqFhB7NqO4qAFe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tree Farm Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angela","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":20}
