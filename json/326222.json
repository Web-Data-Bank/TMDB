Then, René Lussier made a song from that text for his 2014 album (Toucher une âme). Jim Corcoran translated the text to English and recorded it for his CBC radio program, but instead he decided to send it to René Lussier suggesting that maybe he could do something new out of it. René created a new music over the recorded text and after listening to the finished sound track, the two decided that it would be good if there were images to it. This is how it finally ended up in my Drop Box and it gave birth to this film. Afterward, a French version of the film was made with the original French text.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Look Like Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
