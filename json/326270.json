The video chronicles the lives of the trio one week prior, during their road-trip through the French Riviera to shoot a commercial. Shot in the style of found footage – sometimes with an iPhone – this innovative film touts itself as the first “selfie” movie. But, this isn’t a cheeky jab at today’s culture of obsessive self-documentation. Director Lorenzo Corvino’s debut film was born out of a desire to capture the spirit and frustrations of Generation X, the post baby boomers who inherited the economic crisis of the prior generation and who now struggle to compete with the increasingly tech-savvy younger generations. - Vivian Yuen","popularity":0.683,"poster_path":"/xQt15WoKQuHB9rmYXIp0dyDEOxp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wax: We Are The X","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5}
