With candor, they tell their stories through intimate interviews, entertaining and powerful clips of their self-written plays, and glimpse into their everyday lives. Members range from a transgender woman being kicked out of her home, to a runway model who likes men’s clothing, to an out gay man accepted unconditionally by his mother. The plays they write and perform are close to their experiences and not only provide catharsis but insight into what it means to be gay, lesbian, transgender, or just queer. It’s an inspirational work of art about the hardships one faces in realizing that they are different and the courage it takes to find the pride within that. – Nina Zheng","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Year We Thought About Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
