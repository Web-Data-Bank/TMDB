In the Stone Age, the rivalry is set off by dinosaurs, a turtle used as a ouija board, and a round of golf with stones. In ancient Rome, the men display their brawn through a chariot race, using dogs instead of horses. In contemporary times, the man finds himself overcome by modernity, including a very fragile car.","popularity":4.692,"poster_path":"/khadgoKp9eLBY4t0KcST5gzddk3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buster Keaton Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A cyclone of laughs and thrills","title":"Three Ages","video":false,"vote_average":6.936,"vote_count":94}
