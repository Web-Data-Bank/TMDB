Superpowers stem from incredible sacrifices in 'The Mutant Diaries: Unzipping My Genes', a feisty and frank solo musical from performer/composer Eva Moon. Upon learning she had the BRCA genetic mutation, which spikes the risk of breast cancer to 87% and ovarian cancer to 55%, Moon had to make a life-altering choice: remove her healthy breasts and ovaries or face terrifying odds of cancer. Live music, warmth and generous amounts of humor are all expertly woven in this story of her decision -- and the extraordinarily empowering results of that choice. The Mutant Diaries: Unzipping My Genes - a musical about telling cancer to take a hike - was filmed live on stage at Rogue Machine Theatre in Los Angeles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mutant Diaries: Unzipping My Genes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
