There he developed a revolutionary hybrid automobile that was never produced. After a love affair with an African-American dancer in Los Angeles he lived in Tokyo at the end of the 1950s as a recluse and learned Japanese. He spent the last 30 years of his life alone on Hawaii. Despite many opportunities to fulfil his dreams of freedom, success and security, he can never quite set himself free from Switzerland, his mother and his self-reproach and misses the chance to find happiness. Walter's nephew, director Tobias Wyss, tells the story of his uncle in a personal manner, making use of moving photographs and videos from the family archive. The Zurich director reconstructs the contradictory biography of his uncle in seven episodes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Zxsp5GUVBm5Y72N47cA5Yd3ile.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52966,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mira Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":182547,"logo_path":null,"name":"SRF Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2011-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flying Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
