Much of the story centers upon lonely Mrs. Chen who has trouble coping with her philandering husband, and nearly senile mother-in-law. Her daughter frequently sulks and has a desperate crush on one of her teachers. Mrs. Chen's only friend is her co-worker Liu, who has fallen for a new office boy, Chou. Mrs. Chen also finds him attractive. Unfortunately for either woman, Chou is gay and plagued with problems of his own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dX1LhqW2GcKaU6uGpFxLprvn1pF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25345,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Motion Picture Corporation","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1995-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lonely Hearts Club","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
