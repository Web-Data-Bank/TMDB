The series is nine short, abstract, silent digital animations. White dots and dashes move against a black ground, dissolving and reappearing in complex patterns of indefinite scale. Created based on the paradigm of evolution, each successive animation builds upon the complexities of its predecessors by compressing, enlarging, and/or embedding previous ones into future ones. Manipulations repeatedly over different generations produced distortions, such as irregular time lapses, pixelation, and color artifacts. The series ends with the last animation which is distorted to the point of graphic breakdown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Liminal Series","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
