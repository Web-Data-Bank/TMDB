The Parallax Computer responds by activating four Computer Warriors, Romm, Gridd, Micron, and Scanner. All eight ride on circuitboard gliders. The Computer Warriors chase the viruses into a telecomm port, and Romm believes the viruses neutralized in the explosion, but they have escaped into the material world and discovered the ability to convert household objects for their own use. Scanner discovers this and the Computer Warriors learn to do the same, capturing the viruses each on his own CD Rom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kroyer Films","origin_country":""},{"id":6220,"logo_path":"/cAj69EL1zSXmZH6STbMGZrunyMD.png","name":"Mattel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The action-packed adventure where the heroic Computer Warriors battle the evil Virus renegades!","title":"Computer Warriors: The Adventure Begins","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
