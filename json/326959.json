Improvisation is a dangerous art-form; unprepared amateurs invariably come up with gross caricatures when challenged to improvise. The actors' choices in this film include an allegorical pageant of the life of Jesus, a marriage, an orgy, and some genuinely affectionate moments. Nonetheless, as an experimental effort in large-group improvisation, the film is instructive.\r - Clarke Fountain, Rovi","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jVq2yw7E8rHcAUBVxz1InjhdUqe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Marquise","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1972-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What a Flash!","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5}
