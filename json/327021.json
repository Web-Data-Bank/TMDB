The film follows various individuals as they go through the different stages of their day. Some of these people clearly have some sort of mental disabilities, physical disabilities, and possible drug or alcohol problems. That also references the filmâ€™s alternate title The Great White Apocalypse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47215,"logo_path":null,"name":"Very Fine Crap Videos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dog Dick","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
