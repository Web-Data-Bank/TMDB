Long, unbroken sequences of assembly and fabrication focus on the bodies of African American and Vietnamese American workers, while both mobile and fixed cameras transform their acts into pure movement. Everson’s “shift-film” adjusts the frame on race, class, and labor, celebrating the everyday and imbuing working bodies with new dimensions.","popularity":1.072,"poster_path":"/ypaindkT5dBafcXBD0LJkQ4IjUD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trilobite Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":480,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Park Lanes","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
