Through melody, image, color, and natural sound, his film constructs a look at the connecting world we live in—language, growth, time, man, and celebration; city, ocean, discovery, color, and light—in 25 non-linear sections. The music, composed and performed by Cotten, was created simultaneously with the film, underscoring an expression of the intrinsic duality of human perception. Cotten employs a system to create an emotional compass for the viewer using three primary colors: red for dark outlook, yellow for uncertainty, and blue for optimism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Globe as a Graph","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
