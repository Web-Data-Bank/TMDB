Completely deranged and barely aware of his own identity, he makes little attempt at concealing his actions. But in a city with 50,000 homeless citizens, our killer finds himself effortlessly camouflaged.  Steel yourself for a non-stop onslaught of violence and disgusting imagery. Blending horror, drama, and dark comedy, Crazy Murder is a disaster film at its core - featuring a tornado of death, a tsunami of blood, and a volcano of feces.","popularity":2.111,"poster_path":"/dWDZHELU4ejJQleLUtUgsADybFT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Facepuncher Films","origin_country":""},{"id":194589,"logo_path":null,"name":"Horrify","origin_country":""},{"id":118111,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arrow Media Services","origin_country":""},{"id":51428,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unearthed Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crazy Murder","video":false,"vote_average":5.656,"vote_count":16}
