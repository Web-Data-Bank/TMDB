His machine, the Ferrari 375, had enough performance and power to be competitive. But Ferrari's rookie driver, Froilán González, was up against world champion and legend, Juan Manuel Fangio. Ferrari bet his reputation, and perhaps his future as a car manufacturer, on a strategy he considered a secret weapon - his car should need less fuel to make it through the race than that of his nemesis. If he's right, Ferrari could win the race and make a name for himself. If he's wrong, it could be another humiliating and devastating defeat. This programme reveals the full story of Enzo's career, from his early days as a racing driver to quitting Alfa Romeo and establishing his own company, Scuderia Ferrari, the tragic loss of his son Dino and, ultimately, the incredible scenes of his first Formula One victory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/53jGuWLHh5OTQUKgBuOso9uByHK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enzo Ferrari and The Historic Race","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
