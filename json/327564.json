He has made a mess of his life — his marriage is in trouble, since he is pathologically cheating on his wife; his parents (Yosef Millo and Orna Porat) have separated; and his father arrives for an extended visit from Nahariya. Giora spends time with his army buddies, recalling their experiences during the War in Lebanon. His father is undergoing a major life crisis and finds both the loneliness of the city and his son's lifestyle unappealing. As a non-Jew in a Jewish society, he feels estranged, an outsider who has never been able to adapt, and contemplates suicide. Eventually, Giora's parents decide to attempt a reconciliation, until tragedy strikes.","popularity":0.99,"poster_path":"/518iLG9Ij0d7wNiU0ws5RDmC3Uu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tom Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Night Falls","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":5}
