Rabi, a female impersonator who dances with traveling fairs, teams up with Kacem, who hires him to ballyhoo his gambling concession. While Rabi's lack of romantic interest in women befuddles Kacem's son, he does strike up a friendship with a schoolteacher (Nezha Rahile), who in her way is as much of a misfit as Rabi.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qmYU1IFRWIb98smruKDTvi6UiGP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47197,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Sud","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"1998-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bye-Bye Souirty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
