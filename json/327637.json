The result is impeccable, rare footage of Bob Marley performing . In addition, to the raw footage, animation by Craig Bernard and Sara Mora Ivicevich has been included for smooth transitions and a modern touch, since (during that time) the cinematographer was shooting with film and needed to change rolls during the performance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kWjbonRizCbDqAweopnZOoqx437.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70224,"logo_path":null,"name":"Island Records","origin_country":""},{"id":13225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tuff Gong Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bob Marley & the Wailers - Easy Skanking in Boston '78","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
