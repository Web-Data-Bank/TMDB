All participants were contacted through Twitter. As a researcher, Girdwood went in blind with some hypotheses but this film is not anything close to \"investigative journalism\" - it is an honest first step to research that will analyze the future of Flint/Lansing/Detroit in the post-industrial era (after the factories have left). Girdwood interviewed players like Antonio Smith, Marquise Gray, William Hatcher, etc. and also younger players in Lansing to get a perspective on the viability of pro sports as an occupational aspiration. With more leagues overseas and a growing group from Flint who are finding success there, is it something youth can aspire to? At the same time, there are less factory jobs available. So, the film examines sports careers for youth in post-industrialized cities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
