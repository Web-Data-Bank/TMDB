In particular he is to look into the conduct and behavior of Jón Prímus, the old pastor at Snæfell. Fantastic rumors are rife: amongst other things it is said that a corpse is lodged in the glacier! Armed with his tape recorder and notebook, Umbi embarks upon his mission. He tries to question the weird locals, a weird lot, but gets evasive answers. Slowly he is dragged into a quagmire of strange happenings and his efforts to understand only make him confused. If at the beginning he is a chipper, a mere device, by the end of the story he is inextricably involved, a committed participant in the bizarre events.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/vPKwZ2XyQHKSGrxGfTCxR2uQEYc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117704,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umbi s.f.","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":73100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magma Films Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1989-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Glacier","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
