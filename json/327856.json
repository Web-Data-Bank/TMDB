Her bleak existence is lightened for a moment by a sexual encounter with a stranger - and for that transgression, she will have to face the punishment meted out to women of loose morals. Although the story is set at the end of the 1950s, nothing at all has changed since then in village Morocco or in many other Arab societies, especially those where the fundamentalist movement has gained ascendency.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d1VjubbLlExieQUmnlaarHmnFLl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Dolls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
