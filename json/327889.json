As the United States transitions to a 'minority majority' nation, a staggering number of people of color do not identify with America's wild places. By embarking on the grueling multi-week climb of the 20,327ft Denali, nine African-American climbers set out to bridge this 'adventure gap' - challenging outdated notions of what adventure looks like by changing the face of America's biggest and baddest mountain on the 100th anniversary of its first summit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xb6zfm4yvmkjPzGx3FT38Ahb0lL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From every mountainside, let freedom ring","title":"An American Ascent","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
