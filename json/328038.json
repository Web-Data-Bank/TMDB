The author, Andrew Lindy, is obsessed with beauty. A New York based fashion and travel photographer Andrew longs as much for connection as he does for beauty.  Being a travel photographer and having written travel articles for ELLE magazine, Andrew feels at home anywhere in the world... and as a fashion photographer, he is comfortable around beautiful women.  This is a look at the lack of sexual taboo in Cuba, as well as the financial difficulties that lead to prostitution in some Cubans, for the purpose of survival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ph1eSF8TE988wDIBLhx0J3kXZBX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cuba Prostitution Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
