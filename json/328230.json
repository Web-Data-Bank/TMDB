It packs a punch of theological and emotional power gloved in all the soft, warm fuzzies that make family viewing so enjoyable. The movie opens with a glimpse of the nativity scene portrayed in a very touching and human way and then quickly jumps into the drama of the closing hours of the life of Christ.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":"/cLOD6r7wfNV4A9uM6BoQpCQqm0N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jesus: The Desire of Ages","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
