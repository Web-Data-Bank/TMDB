Roger is a yoga teacher. His daughter Zoe returns home from the military and to Rogers dismay resumes her relationship with her allegedly schizophrenic girlfriend Maya. Opposed to Zoe's pursuit of Maya but eager to be a part of his daughters life, Roger becomes entangled in the ups and downs of their relationship. Increasingly late and obviously distracted during his yoga classes, his few remaining students begin to lose patience. When Rogers well-meaning friend Morris offers them a live-in renovation job in an upscale Brooklyn home, the three of them move in and start a job they are not exactly qualified for. Living rent-free provides them with a respite from the responsibilities and expectations of the outside world. Together they try to find comfort in their new reality while being revisited by their troubled pasts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uw0EC3viEhFg8WC2xEDeHGCxO42.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Utopians","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
