The film features some very creative imagery, a groovy 70's jazz score, and very little spoken dialogue. It's a story about a dog named Joe that falls in love with a rose and protects it from a mean spirited crow. There's some energetic Fritz Freeling style action. There's also some unexpectedly grim tragedy, not including the anticipated outcome, which does occur as expected.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8487,"logo_path":"/bXWVZmW3RD6SAk0lFahPxNbp541.png","name":"Sanrio","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1977-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rose And Joe","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
