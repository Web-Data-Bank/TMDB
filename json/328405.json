The Los Angeles Times describes it as \"a tumbling series of visuals with four distinct aesthetic styles. Peter Sluszka's ultra-slow motion capture of exploding mushrooms and elegantly disseminating seed pods … Julia Pott's line art of wolves and foxes hovering in geometric constellations … Guilherme Marcondes' renderings of skeletons caught among leafless branches and verdant human arms that unfurl like ferns… Santa Maria provides context…with cosmic, computer-generated vistas, cartoons of splintering bones.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2aYQRSW186u3QMrNjetZf8R7G4C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here Come The Waves: The Hazards of Love Visualized","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
