Bryan Wizemann's haunting and elegiac feature film debut is a contemporary portrait of ritual and superstition, intimacy and estrangement. In direct contrast with the current zeitgeist of a Las Vegas myth, LOSING GROUND is a personal and closely observed work on the addictions of human nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Losing Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
