The unconventional narrative uses the patterns of Persian poetry, with visual metaphors and rhymes and rhythms between the scenes. A lot of the material is found 16mm and 8mm footage that mirrors the director's memories of her own trip through Europe more than twenty years ago. The images of the main character’s dance also reflect on the alienation of the individual. The combination of all these creative approaches evokes a special world between reality and fairytale.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g4uuoQXcvi9fgN4lV4u9wFNx0Qv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2011-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Day I Disappeared","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
