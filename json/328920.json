At the center of the bizarre story was a quiet, unassuming 14-year-old kid named Danny Almonte. Nicknamed \"The Little Unit,\" the hard-throwing left-hander was exposed by Sports Illustrated as being too old to have competed in the tournament. The story instantly caught national and even international attention, as Danny was pushed into the spotlight and accused of cheating in the most sacred of all amateur sports. Twelve years later, the reclusive Almonte finally tells the truth about one of the strangest chapters in youth sports history: a hoax that would forever change the way people view amateur athletics in America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p2bLsmNxrKllc1cTs6iUxoGNPXM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kid Danny","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
