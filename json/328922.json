Through interviews with Mackey, his sports psychologists and commentators, as well as footage of his playing days and his treatment (which involved using a baseball to find the boyhood traumas underlying his career-ending anxiety), this program will look at the mental side of sports and probe what takes a player in and out of the \"zone\".","popularity":0.629,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fields of Fear","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
