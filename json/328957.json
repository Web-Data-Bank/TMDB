I used Method acting to develop the character by drawing every day for two months so that I could draw on camera without cues, diagrams or even anatomical models. Except for a few minutes of documentary style footage taken my husband, this is a one-man movie. The movie was shot on first-gen Canon Vixias, except for the street scenes, which were shot on a Flip.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spinster","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
