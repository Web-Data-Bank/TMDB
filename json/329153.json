It defies the basic laws of physics, yet holds the keys to life. Known to ancients as a transmitter to and from the higher realms, water retains memory and conveys information to DNA. However, water can die if treated poorly. Influences such as sound, thoughts, intention, as well as toxins such as chlorine, structure water’s molecular arrangement– affecting all it comes in contact with. Prominent scientists help reveal the secret of water, allowing us to use this amazing element to heal ourselves and our planet.\r The movie features Nassim Haramein, Patrick Flanagan, Dr. Masaru Emoto, Konstantin Korotkov, Lynne McTaggart, and Larry Dossey.","popularity":1.678,"poster_path":"/8u7MrhlnCqlyHTrdhz12yiVikiN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2015-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret of Water","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
