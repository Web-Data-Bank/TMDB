Behind this bill stands a lone woman brilliantly played by a remarkable Emmanuelle Devos (also in The Other Son): Simone Veil the Minister of Health in the Jacques Chirac government during the presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. During these three days of violent debate Veil, a Jew and Holocaust survivor, is spared nothing: political negotiations, solitude, sparring arguments, insults and violence to her family. In spite of all of this, Veil never wavers.","popularity":1.097,"poster_path":"/1qefiPO2XSxw65LhapWkcv06rQY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11246,"logo_path":"/4YZ5CQZkJa2FIKGtjLLoKhNOAIw.png","name":"La Région Île-de-France","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17174,"logo_path":null,"name":"K'Ien Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Law","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":14}
