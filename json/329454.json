When he sees that their sheep are threatened with a possibly devastating illness, the precarious nature of the group's existence is brought home to him and he leaves to gain a livelihood and knowledge in the city. Once he gets back, bringing money and presents, it first appears that the group will be assured of a better future because of his enterprising outreach. Yet military and governmental officials arrive on the scene to take a census and the young man is conscripted, against his will.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yVJGYUlQEkz5gOdKYKSbwZ8ztU0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shadow of the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
