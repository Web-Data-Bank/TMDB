She recalls a childhood filled with moral abuse by her mother, sister and friends, calling her silly offensive names referencing her overweight.

She’s fired for being fat, she wants a liposuction but the doctor informs her she’s not a candidate due to her overweight, and all her universe seems to be collapsing after a series of unfortunate events.
