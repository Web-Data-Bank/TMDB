Coco is an eleven-year-old kid who intensely wishes to be a grown-up, to be a man. A walk along the river with Johana -his new Venezuelan neighbor- initiates Coco in the adult world. But his father and life itself slow him down and make him feel small and insignificant; just a child. When life gets complicated it is probably best to let oneself go with the flow and float down the river like a drifting log.","popularity":1.394,"poster_path":"/hksFLK5DU6AYbE0Rtj3P3sdurxh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77289,"logo_path":null,"name":"Primer Plano Film Group","origin_country":""},{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":8371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sudestada Cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":91450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zona Audiovisual","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":91451,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vaimbora Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2013-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Coco is an eleven-year-old kid who intensely wishes to be a grown-up, to be a man.","title":"Choele","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6}
