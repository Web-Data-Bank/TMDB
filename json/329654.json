And at a vernissage, she meets a young and handsome Japanese man called Gen and falls head over heels in love with him. Also, Gen does not seem averse to a relationship. What Rike does not know is that Gene's heart belongs to his friend Thomas. In Rike, the homosexual young man sees the suitable marriage candidate to secure his stay in Germany. When Richard announces his  wedding with his new girlfriend, Rike does not want to be inferior.
