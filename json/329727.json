A year later, he committed suicide. After twelve years, Avikunthak completed the film. Using his footage as the leitmotif, this film is a requiem to a dead friend, and metamorphosises into an “existential inquiry into the idea of death”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iaNY7zMeGW4niy4wCDBjv9u9Ofx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vakratunda Swaha","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
