Galleo takes advantage of the situation by using it in a blackmail scheme against Arthur, which is shaky, at best, as Olive refuses to stay dead.","popularity":1.541,"poster_path":"/jhpGygYVXyuxy2VGCxZR7Q68ZLA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bryan Foy Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bringing you the best time of your life!","title":"Out of the Blue","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
