Late in 1916, a brave and idealistic Russian officer in his 20s comes to his superiors' attention when he stands up to Rasputin at a nightclub. He's asked to carry important papers from Petersburg to Stockholm by train in the dead of winter, a dangerous mission. The first-class carriage may be full of spies, and soon after the train embarks, the man in the next compartment searches Obozow's luggage. A beautiful stranger approaches him, a woman older than he, on a concert tour; a game of cat and mouse ensues with patriotism and emotion sometimes on opposite sides. Can Obozow consummate the affair, reach Stockholm, and maintain his ideals?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A1mLpY9n5t0g4nTBHJWfYgp2fqE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agencja Produkcji Filmowej","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":170208,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1993-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beautiful stranger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
