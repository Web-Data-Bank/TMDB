Christmas Eve - a blizzard's on the way and Marcus Littleton is having a very bad night! His call centre is facing closure because he can't hit his sales target. To Marcus, the products they sell are frankly...scary. He now has to tell the nightshift (a bunch feisty, hormonal and downright odd women) that they no longer have a job! Disillusioned and suffering with chronic IBS, he can't wait for the night to be over. However, Fate, in the form of dead cats, stalkers, power-cuts, snowdrifts and hostages - has other ideas!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fJue2V0OJdfSBvWA1IHXwe6UBqw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twas The Shift Before Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
