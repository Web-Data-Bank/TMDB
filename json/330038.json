The lead characters lead boring lives during the day and, as depicted here, downright pathetic existences at night, all decked out in peacock plumes and high heels and with nowhere to go. Several of the performances -- especially Fritz Helmuth as the love-starved, aptly named Bent -- manage to reach a little beyond the stereotypes, but Bodil Kj√¶r, of all people, delivers a simply dreadful (and one-note) parody of a once-glamorous movie star.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k8mC0CVHmzAVaYqfIwgytRHQ00m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9327,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crone Film Produktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1978-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirror, Mirror","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
