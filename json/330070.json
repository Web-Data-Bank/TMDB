They came up with an efficient and cost effective plan of sending cockroaches and mold to the surface so that the mold would absorb the sunlight and the insect corpses would serve as a food source for the mold.  It is now the year 2577 and the first manned ship to Mars has landed on the planet and the six crew members are ready for their mission. But what they find are giant mutated humanoid cockroaches with incredible physical strength. The crew members are easily wiped out, but not before sending a transmission back to Earth. Now, humanity will send elite warriors to exterminate the mutated bugs and claim back Mars.","popularity":12.981,"poster_path":"/z1A7bajfwadBi5eAgXiWDMpY5i9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42521,"logo_path":"/pQfzDuY4chOVbSmsurvB9MHFsYa.png","name":"LIDENFILMS","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We're the ones who will survive.","title":"Terra Formars","video":false,"vote_average":6.128,"vote_count":219}
