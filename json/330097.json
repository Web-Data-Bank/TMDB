Veronique is wealthy and from the provinces, Adrien is impoverished and his ancestors come from Brittany. In spite of their different backgrounds, the two fall in love, marry, and eventually have a baby girl. At just about that time, Veronique decides to go back to school, and Adrien becomes both mother and father to their baby. Unable to cope with Veronique's new-found intellectual friends and different lifestyle, Adrien clashes with her, and their arguments lead to a separation for awhile. The two then get back together again, but not for long. It is on a return trip from visiting his mother in Brittany that Adrien's life undergoes a dramatic change, and his story takes an equally unexpected turn.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/byyCH4qVKO4B2tYQIi8Scctcc47.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18888,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Passage","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":27491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Garance Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Odessa Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1985-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Better Life","title":"Le Meilleur de la Vie","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
