Poetry and music are the places of their meetings. Chavela explains when he lived in the same room where Federico García Lorca lived decades ago, was visited by a bird that contained the soul of the Spanish poet. In her last year of life, Chavela fulfills her last wish: to make a tribute to Spanish poet and finally meet him in the ranks of death. The Nightingale and the Night is a documentary that chronicles the transition from Chavela life to death, her union with Federico, dissolving the borders between reality and dreams.","popularity":0.865,"poster_path":"/luXbMcxINDyDJMgAB08Lbi0ivce.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169797,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mago Production","origin_country":""},{"id":169798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monkey Head Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nightingale and the Night.
