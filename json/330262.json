In addition, she is blackmailed by the supposed charmer with a shared sex video. Thea thinks about revenge. That's when it makes sense for her to find an ally in the bona fide bookseller Babette. This was led by Benedict only to the altar and then left with credit debts. When it comes to money, love ends - but the fun begins in this revenge comedy starring Katrin Sass, Petra Kleinert, Jasmin Schwiers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A9FdvqDNBfBIKieRqL4xE3gznno.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heiratsschwindler küsst man nicht","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":3}
