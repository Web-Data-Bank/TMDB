Photographer Vancsó Zoltán uses cinema as an irregular photo gallery to invite viewers for a close to 70-minute meditative journey. So there is no need to prepare for dialogue or an explicit story: the experience is based on photographs, taken mostly in forests, using a special, stunningly impressionistic technique, and a matching, meditative soundtrack, jointly created with Tius.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48455,"logo_path":null,"name":"PhotoVancso","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2012-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landslides - Exploring the Void","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
