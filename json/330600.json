After that follow the first play scenes. In a buoyant conversation, two model cases of sexual difficulties in marriage and their causes are discussed. A newlywed couple one the one side and a couple already married for seven years on the other side discuss about their problems. The words are illustrated by play scenes, short comments which point to the consequences of a lack of sexual education are inserted in between. With the newlyweds, the premature orgasm of the husband causes his wife woes as she is missing the loving foreplay and aftermath. The second husband, an architect who has become father of two children in the meantime, in contrast, neglects his wife in favour of his job.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zgVqVAYpPv04N0LPUCbCAB4KZ5b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arca-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1968-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Miracle of Love","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
