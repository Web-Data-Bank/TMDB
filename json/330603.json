Kolle explains that an infidelity on the part of one of the two partners by no means has to mean the end of a marriage, but could even be an enrichment. Kolle's explanations are supported by two films in which a wife, neglected by her husband, gives herself to a childhood friend, and a husband, after initially resisting his secretary, finally ends up in bed with her after a fit of jealousy on the part of his wife.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e0SGSDVi40Ex6ULMCW8gsuPnUuX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arca-Winston Films Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1969-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adultery","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
