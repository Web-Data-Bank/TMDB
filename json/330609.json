In blatant violation of the Geneva Convention, the Jewish American soldiers in the 106th Infantry Division, together with those who had \"Jewish-sounding\" names or who \"looked\" Jewish, were shipped off to the slave-labor camp at Berga am Elster, a satellite camp of the infamous Buchenwald.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mKOJGpih5K8rFtcpq5ojPJue6US.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79919,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guggenheim Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"World War II.
