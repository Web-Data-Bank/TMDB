The department store was the site of a grizzly murder/suicide years before and now... it's the perfect location for a wild Halloween party. Two floors, fifty thousand square feet, loud music, booze, sexy Halloween costumes, and one uninvited guest. It's one hell of a night and by morning the only survivor, a woman with psychic abilities, is pitted in a cat and mouse game with the killer, running from room to room and using her powers to retrace the final steps of the other guests.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vAEWWPouYkxxkXCE1NJFiRzvclU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Save the best for last","title":"Black Eve","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2}
