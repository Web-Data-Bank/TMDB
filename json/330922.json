Devastated by the discovery that Monkey can only perform in hospitals if he can be boil-washed, Nina tries to go it alone with only a red nose, a few misshapen balloon animals and some slightly disappointing magic tricks. Not to mention her professional snobbery rearing up as she finds herself turning into a baby-voiced children's entertainer. Then there are the difficulties she encounters when faced with clown phobia. Following her directorial debut with Her Master's Voice which won a Grierson Award and a BAFTA nomination, Nina Conti brings us another frank and intimate documentary about her eventful two-year stint as a hospital clown. Join her to discover whether Nina raised a laugh amongst sick children or whether she cried the tears of a clown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nina Conti: Clowning Around","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
