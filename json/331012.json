And he kept his promise. Never ending yearning for knowledge, research practice, creative endeavor, discoveries that have unfixed all established notions - that's what was the characteristic of the great physicist. Nikola Tesla would always remain a scientist whose life was a sort of mystification rather than pure reality.","popularity":0.722,"poster_path":"/4DwzHStLPNlsj2whDTFChm5WS3e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21652,"logo_path":"/o5qeK1nhECoVkuIxMO4T6yBYqwX.png","name":"FILM.UA Group","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2013-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tesla's Free Energy, the Race to Zero Point","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
