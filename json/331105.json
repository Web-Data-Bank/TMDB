He is well-liked by them both and becomes a frequent visitor who helps out with the daily chores. Unbeknownst to Manis, the young man is in fact a prince-in-disguise. So a romance between a royal and a commoner blossoms, as the couple exchange teasing pantuns at the next opportunity - while gathering wood, or while tidying up the rumah ibu. All is bliss when Manis agrees to marry Suleiman in secret even after finding out his true identity. Separation of the loving pair beckons when the prince receives news from the palace and returns to his ailing father, who at his death bed agrees to a royal intermarriage between his son and a princess from a neighbouring monarchy.  A family reconciliation and cursed tragedy ensue.","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":"/jjO96dWwLq6ZaQPxr7oD7UPCO8q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cathay-Keris Films","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"1962-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mata Shaitan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
