For Palindrome, Frampton selected images which he described as “tending towards the biomorphic,” resembling abstract surrealist painting.  However, the rigid palindromic structure that Frampton imposes on the images—a motorized sequence based on “twelve variations on each of forty congruent phrases”—deviates from the subjective aesthetic of the expressive, demonstrating Frampton’s interest in the “generative power” of films composed by rules and principles.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Palindrome","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8}
