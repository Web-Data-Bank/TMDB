A man and woman guide us on this trip, taking us past gently falling Mondrian paintings, violent car crashes and bombing raids, and a pair of dancing, multicolored boxes, among many other settings. Based on an improvised performance, 'Suggestive Gestures' leads us gradually and indirectly towards a mysterious animal, hiding in the center of the maze.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lake Ivan Performance Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suggestive Gestures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
