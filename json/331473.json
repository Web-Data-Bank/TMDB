On most nights this wouldn't be that taxing. But tonight isn't most nights. With rumors of the police commissioner's alleged disappearance circulating, and the mayor enacting a strict curfew, it doesn't take long for things to spiral out of control and the whole town to go mad. Is it just hysteria? Is it a curse? Is it Abraham Lincoln's fault? Nobody knows. But for the gang, only one thing is certain. They should have NEVER left the basement.","popularity":2.046,"poster_path":"/hkcTwavDSxm0aZ63RPEWJyR0N0n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86522,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hometown Hero Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Never Leave Your Basement","title":"River City Panic","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
