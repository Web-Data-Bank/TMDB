The two tribes lived in peace and harmony, their domains separated by the \"Words Worth\" tablet—a huge monolith slab erected by an almighty creator. Although the tablet has writing on it, neither Tribe can read the text. One day, Words Worth was mysteriously destroyed by an unknown entity; its fragments scattered among the domain of the Tribes of Shadow.","popularity":2.386,"poster_path":"/tSWTImoGYFjZIPZHhB4aBDTrtty.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4623,"logo_path":"/6TTOZLBofZcXjfAn756veRP0ns4.png","name":"Green Bunny","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elf","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2002-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Words Worth: Outer Story","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
