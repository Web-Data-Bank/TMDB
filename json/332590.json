The film seeks a visceral and visual understanding of Rachel Browne, through her body of dance work, the bodies and souls of the artists who have danced with her, and through her voice and that of her family. Despite challenges and personal trauma, and because of them, Rachel Browne chose to survive and to adapt, exposing a raw desire to create dance to the exclusion of all else.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Good Madness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
