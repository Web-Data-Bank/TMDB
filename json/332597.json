With a combination of chutzpah, street smarts and an unflinching will to live, he spent the war flirting with danger as a teenage Jew hiding in plain site. Witnessing first-hand the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi occupation, frequently cheating death himself and losing his entire family in the process, Gutowski's story is ultimately one of hope. As recounted with humor and pathos to his son, filmmaker Adam Bardach, his remarkable survival tale represents a thumb of the nose at darkness and totalitarianism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing Before the Enemy: How a Teenage Boy Fooled the Nazis and Lived","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
