In the shadow of its own narratives of freedom, Europe has been quietly building its own great wall. Like its famous Chinese precursor, this wall has been piecemeal in construction, diverse in form and dubious in utility. Gradually cohering across the continent, this system of enclosure and exclusion is urged upon a populace seemingly willing to accept its necessity and to contribute to its building.","popularity":0.971,"poster_path":"/lfInJORLPluOdeG8OcSNlY66j0N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Wall","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
