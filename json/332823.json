An anthropologist, author (her most recent book is \"Refugees of the Revolution: Experiences of Palestinian Exile) and filmmaker, Diana Allan documents the experiences of the Ibrahim family, who have been making a living as fishermen for generations. The film looks at their relationship to work and to the physical environment and how they've persevered in this â€˜temporary' home.  Produced at Harvard's Sensory Ethnography Lab, Terrace of the Sea is a haunting work, a meditation on the process of memory and on the distances between photography and film, land and sea and - between seeing and being seen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harvard Sensory Ethnography Lab","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrace of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
