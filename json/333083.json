Mainly shot at night in an observant style, the film shows the highs and lows of shopping mall Hoog Catharijne and the adjacent train station area. The concrete jungle with desolate nooks, tunnels and arcades seems to lead its own life under the pulsating neon light. Gradually, the constructed surroundings emerge as a versatile, battered organism, used in a continuous, contrasting and bizarre way by junks and cleaners, travellers and shoppers.","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":49728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Lieshout Filmproducties","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winkelhart","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
