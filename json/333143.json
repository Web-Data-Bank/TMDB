The lesson is that in life, not everything happens as would appear logical at the outset. In the wake of the inflexible and demagogic dramas of Stalinism, this colourful comedy was a true breath of fresh air. It is innovative not only for being full of great hits but also for being the first film in a very long time that was about pure love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uHao1HHCZUpcHn7YCOAID0MKJPj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50067,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magyar Filmgyártó Állami Vállalat","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1954-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2x2 Are Sometimes 5","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
