While Roseanne may have revolutionized the way Americans talked about family, class, race, gender, and gay rights, this campaign trail adventure is a personal account of Roseanne’s thoughts on these subjects—and others, as we have never heard them before. What seems at first like a political profile quickly becomes a humorous and sentimental picture of an icon. This surprising journey uncovers raw and revealing moments from Roseanne’s private world, while juxtaposing her current influence as a politician with her role as a comedy leader in the '90s.","popularity":0.698,"poster_path":"/4ZtL74q8JACfRb5U2yBDzGko5Qj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roseanne for President!","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
