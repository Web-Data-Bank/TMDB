The film that resulted from his Cairo sojuourn is a complex, painterly critique of the Egyptian musical and cinema star system. At the same time, the film shows the divergent states of possibility or despair faced by men and women within a changing Egyptian society. Smihi’s film plays out over thirty years and the events of the Nasserite years and the Palestine / Israel conflict become integral to the narrative. By blending newsreel footage with his own lush cinematography, Smihi creates a complex portrait of contemporary Egyptian society in the post-war years.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":"/qir8GoHBIDy3MecWKZoXAjZs5Qw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"1992-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lady from Cairo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
