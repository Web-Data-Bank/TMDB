The siblings have had an incestuous relationship, but the sister falls in love with a French officer in charge of their village, and the brother leaves for parts unknown. After the war is over, the brother returns to his village, only to discover that his sister did in childbirth. He has brought back a Russian wife, and for some reason the villagers elect him to be their mayor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1y5xUrZXzepF4iuUAusS5snyOrq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Honour of the Tribe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
