In addition to attempts at escape, this prison drama also includes propaganda and brainwashing attempts by the French and scenes of torture. In what is possibly the most horrible torture of all, the inmates are forced to listen to broadcast speeches by General Charles de Gaulle -- speeches which illustrate the changing relations between the French and the Algerians.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4PdGIYNtFf42WuNdpqOpF2JJ2A6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139395,"logo_path":"/iMxqDt5FiNhGldhQ0cl05psORHO.png","name":"Office National pour le Commerce et l'Industrie Cinématographique (ONCIC)","origin_country":"DZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1967-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
