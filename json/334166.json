But - surprise! - Klondike Joe is no longer a drunk. Instead, he’s been \"converted by this BARRY MOORE fellow,\" a real-life evangelist who \"transformed\" Joe and now starts on Jeff and Kevin. Sure enough, not only does Jeff start reading the Bible, but loses interest in the company because he’s \"had a transforming experience with Jesus Christ!\" Kevin, on the other hand, becomes a teenage drunk after his white-trash girlfriend Dana tries to lure him away from religion with parties and ­ gasp! - bottles of beer. But when one of Kevin’s drunken buddies puts on a dress and falls off the roof of a house, Kevin wants to take Dana to Barry’s Big Crusade.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man of Steel","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
