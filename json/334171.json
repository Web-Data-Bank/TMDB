A successful actress, Madison was one of many women who directed films at Universal, particularly in the mid 1910s. In this two-reeler, she stars as a young city girl dragged into a life of crime by a ne’er-do-well suitor. A terrific surprise ending gives Eleanor and Cleo an early claim to promoting women’s equality in the workforce.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z02Hnzmm1wCy7ryFaRRMmsibvHc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eleanor's Catch","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7}
