A business trip to check on a project called “Galapagos in Greece” by the islanders and for which his bank extended a loan and credit, brought him there. Being a German, he wants to investigate thoroughly, but Panos, a mini-mart owner, and the mayor try their utmost to sabotage him—to camouflage a not-so-good reality. After every single trial resulted in nothing because of the islanders’ secret meddling, Jorg’s trip becomes elongated, like The Odyssey’s, forcing him to contemplate the priorities and responsibilities in life again.","popularity":4.711,"poster_path":"/2RqX9BLGM76S1Bwks2MZiR0cCsE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1478,"logo_path":"/plHEkpGkULYqiLRpYsUak8uYmhU.png","name":"Sat.1","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":78486,"logo_path":"/oKG2ahqSVN8i5Rd0U9ZNbNY6jK7.png","name":"Pantaleon Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2015-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Highway to Hellas","video":false,"vote_average":5.527,"vote_count":37}
