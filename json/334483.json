The film shows how school children of all ages in Israel are taught to pay tribute to their nation's past. It keenly observes how some memories are even physically conditioned into the future generations. \"One of the most truly, most intelligent, most terrible and sharpest films about Israeli society.  A film on memory and politics: this is the way that Israeli society exploits its myths to train people to have no doubts or remorse, creating the soldiers of the future wars.\" (Tom Segev - Haaretz)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jKID3ruh75aWjN4FyqXSsaDClkm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Izkor: Slaves of Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
