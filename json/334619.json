Hammer employs filmed footage which, through optical printing and editing, is layered and manipulated to create a compelling meditation on her visit to her grandmother in a nursing home. The sense of sight becomes a constantly evolving process of reseeing images retrieved from the past and fused into the eternal present of the projected image. Hammer has lent a new voice to the long tradition of personal meditation in the avant-garde of the American independent cinema.\" -- John Hanhardt, Biennial Exhibition Catalogue, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 1987","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yXSPOR5vbtKLVyozG5fb9aPW0yR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Optic Nerve","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
