The movie as a whole is an exposition of the events in Nympha’s life that lead to this scene. Nympha is a young girl reared and morally sheltered by a hypocritically pious elder female relative. The girl’s blind piety, however, is ripped apart by her sudden awareness of the sexually-charged environment and by her own first love affair. Eventually, she goes from man to man, driven by her demonic desires. Her unwanted pregnancy finally leads to a gory, fatal abortion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1971-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nympha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
