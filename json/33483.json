But more than anything they all eagerly anticipate the crowning moment of the holiday season: the arrival of Grannypillar's scrumptious fruitcake. Suddenly, Christmas is hijacked when Iggy and Ziggy Cockroach - the greediest bugs in the garden - steal Grannypillar's fruitcake. How will Christmas survive!? But deep in the hearts of the youngest of hearts, the true meaning of Christmas shines through. Hailey and Bailey, through an act of unheard of generosity, together remind the garden that the celebration of Christmas is nothing about fruitcake, but about God's gift to us.","popularity":0.66,"poster_path":"/e6dBzOaP0mXrUnzTMhdTkZawv4P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hermie & Friends: A Fruitcake Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
