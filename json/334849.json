It trembles on the line between the violent and the risible. Featuring actors and objects, YOU ME AND IT traces a world where cruelty is ticklish but always looming. There is the supposition of a body being tenderly corroded. Striking text elements manifest the voice or voices of some other. Music and sound add another shade to the  evocation of a pathetic narrative. While comprised of carefully considered components (visual, textual and aural), You Me and It operates on the total repetitions of deferred, frantic energy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Me and It","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
