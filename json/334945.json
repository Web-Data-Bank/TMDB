Jointly with 'Yes', Genesis have been the most influential band for generations of progressive rock bands. 1974 saw the release of The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, an epic prog rock monument tuned to perfection. Not all was peaches and cream, however, when singer Peter Gabriel left the band after the supporting tour. After a long, futile search for a new vocalist, the remaining band members decided to let drummer Phil Collins take over the microphone - another stroke of genius. Whether it was mainly for Collins or not, the band steadily drifted away from theatrical prog rock towards mainstream pop music. Perfect evidence is this 1980 concert at the Lyceum Ballroom in London which coincided with the work on their monster-selling studio album Abacab.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":"/a2k1g3QJL0GqBf1jU3ScMJ4MtsB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19186,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intergroove","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1980-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Recorded Live at the Lyceum Ballroom, London, May 6th,1980.","title":"Genesis: Live in London","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
