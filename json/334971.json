Edouard Bamporiki (Eddy) is a lyrical poet, actor and director who travels the country showing his films and sharing anecdotes from his past. Yves Montand Niyongabo (Yves) is an ambitious 22-year old first-time director who hopes his work will win prestigious grants and film awards. Both filmmakers are part of a nascent but quickly evolving film and media community based in Kigali, the nation's capital and the film trails them for several months. The studio Eddy and Yves belong to -- Almond Tree Films Rwanda -- creates several short films a year and collaborated to produce the documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rwanda: Take Two","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
