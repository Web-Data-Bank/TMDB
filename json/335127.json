Hounded by his best friend Seth who thinks no \"10\" would even go out with a guy like Ricky unless she had ulterior motives (or needed glasses), Ricky starts to get skeptical himself. Turns out, Danita confesses she's actually married to a handsome affable crime novelist and former Rabbi, Ben Jacobs. Is Danita telling Ricky the truth when she says wants to leave her husband but fears for her life if she does? Will Ricky go through with the plan to kill him so he and Danita can live happily ever after?","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/l9PQY9eXiu9hKcMFcFvGrx3zwyv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"2 nerds, 10 women, 24 hours","title":"Midnight Sex Run","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":8}
