Focusing on the reality behind the image, and specifically on the strategies of Madison Avenue, they interview prominent 1970s admen such as George Lois and Jerry Della Femina. They also go behind the scenes of commercial shoots, where such figures as Ronald McDonald and the precocious child actor Mason Reese are put through grinding routines, only to reveal themselves as jaded pros off-camera. In this clear-eyed look at the manipulation inherent in advertising, the TVTV crew meets its match in the relentless cynicism and masculine braggadocio of the seasoned admen; ultimately, TVTV conveys respect for the savvy and skills of these shrewd veterans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Ah3eUFjDObpbrLvzOuJGibj3F4t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50946,"logo_path":"/1lTs6kx4LNc48mypKt9F0y5X3XH.png","name":"WTTW/Chicago","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
