He was actually a typographer. With “Trab Trab” he made an impish attempt to create a synthesis between Dadaism and New Objectivity. The film is a precise and elegant account of a racecourse. It does so without narration or images of either horses or patrons; everything we see has been captured either pre- or post-race.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7PfxDXOFQObLDGUz4q9yXGD5Bmn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1959-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trot Trot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
