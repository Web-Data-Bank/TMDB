These works investigated the primal conditions of cinema itself. The films explore the relationship between screen image and spatio-temporal illusion â€“ the materiality of the screen in relationship to the image as representation. Ideas that each artist would continue to explore after collaboration. But further to these concerns, these films mark a vital phase in the process of both artists as they sought to create a body of work with intellectual rigour without sacrificing the imaginative and aesthetic qualities of art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Surface","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
