Beginning with the empty exhibition hall, the description is neutral and analytical. It progresses in ever larger circles, placing emphasis on all the important functional elements, from the electronic devices in the exhibition space, to the city's traffic regulation to the communication and information media and finally, to the climatic conditions of the London environment. The film concludes with six interviews regarding the big news item of the day: the future \"landing\" of the first men on the moon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Study of Relationships Between Inner and Outer Space","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
