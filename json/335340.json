In a recurring motif of Gérard Blain’s cinema, Pierre is taken under the wing of an older gay man, Hubert , who offers him work and financial security; but when Hubert makes advances to him, Pierre robs him and takes up with a group of radical leftists who are planning terrorist attacks. Without employment, Pierre loses Nathalie to child services and spirals into desperation, finally erupting in an act of horrific violence. An x-ray showing the largely undiagnosed sickness of its time, and a stern warning to ours.","popularity":0.96,"poster_path":"/plr2ab5BIRP15LjZJBUhpK1GSdy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50989,"logo_path":null,"name":"R.O.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rebel","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
