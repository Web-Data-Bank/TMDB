Particularly effective are a pointless search by goon-like policemen, and a caf√© conversation between Tunde's friends, both of which do more to 'explain' delinquency than all of your glib sociological theorising. Like all neo-realism, Tunde's Film has the authority of performers re-enacting lived experience rather than acting.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/hxWUIcQb1oyU3NzmjM11NrneJbO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basement Film Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tunde's Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
