He sang hits from the Guess Who, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, and his solo career, interspersing stories along the way, adding the biographical song \"Prairie Town\" as a framing device. This 2014 set  generally has a lower energy level than the original recordings but the relaxed vibe is part of the appeal: it's not a race, it's a nostalgic stroll with the amiable Bachman. If you're on the same wavelength as him, it's an enjoyable way to pass the time.","popularity":0.923,"poster_path":"/wzdk4Nfhb3ewgYnNFx94cQPE6hz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Music Canada","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Randy Bachman - Vinyl Tap Tour - Every Song Tells a Story","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
