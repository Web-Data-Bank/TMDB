As crazy as they are for each other, their relationship is far from harmonious. (The lack of money doesn't help matters, either.) In fact, their whole family is fraught with unresolved conflicts. Then Claude's uncle is arrested on a felony charge, and everyone rallies round. Ruby's mother Jewel and flirtatious sister Rose (Claude's ex-girlfriend) even fly in from Tennessee; but, far from being a source of support, Jewel seems only to want to break up Ruby and Claude.","popularity":3.41,"poster_path":"/7MfP7nCRhSYePUec86i31DDPNMd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-26","revenue":6718,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's hard to stand by your man... when your sister's sitting in his lap.","title":"Daddy and Them","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":32}
