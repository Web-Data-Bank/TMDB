Among those are the Practical Joker who will do anything for a laugh; the Party Entertainer who never stops singing; the Talkative Neigbor who forgets the time; the noisy neighbors who dance the tango all night; and women drivers, people who telephone at meal time, the friend you never saw before and amatuer medical experts. Much use of trick photography, montages, puppets and animation along with some adult Gallic wit and gentle satire.","popularity":0.857,"poster_path":"/slEkbEfgEbitwVXCksxR3coLKqc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alain Poiré","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1948-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spice of Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6}
