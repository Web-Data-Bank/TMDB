He denies all attempts to defend himself. Locked up, he waits for the arrival of \"Caleuche,\" the Ship (Nave) of Fools (de los locos), a mythical figure of his ancestral strength which \"made\" him start the fire. An appointed lawyer (a white woman) comes to the chief's defence, alleging the chief had acted in self-defense as the white man was building commercial structures on the sacred burial grounds of his ancestors, and continued doing so even after heated protests.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ship of Fools","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
