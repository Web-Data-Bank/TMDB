Centuries later in Jodhpur, India, the Hanuman langurs are fighting still. Comprised of 20 or more females and their young, and governed by a ‘Warlord, ‘ 29 langur ‘gangs’ have carved up the city between them. Warlords reign for three or four years before they’re overthrown. When a new Warlord comes to power he will purge the gang of young males, creating a society of ‘Lost Boys’ whose only chance is to violently displace another Warlord. Natural selection is harsh indeed, but what better way to build a culture of warriors?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8090,"logo_path":"/ktzmUmVCQPjQGblWfDPBLKsIWKA.png","name":"BBC Earth","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monkey Warriors","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
