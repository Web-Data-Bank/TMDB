Using simple illustrations, geologist Dr. Andrew Snelling examines these assumptions and equips viewers with information to counter their anti-biblical arguments.  Though this topic can seem intimidating, Dr. Snelling boils it down to laymans level and walks the viewer through a basic understanding of the process used to date rocks and fossils. Using simple illustrations, the assumptions used to arrive at dates are exposed as faultyâ€”and the evolutionary timescale along with them. Then, through several lines of evidence, including carbon-14 found in diamonds and fossils, the inconsistent nature of radiometric ages is revealed. Find our how creationists can turn this apparent foe into a friend by starting with Scripture as the ultimate authority!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qHPI0IGEXQqfLH5XcP12jNYtx1S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Turning foe into friend","title":"Radioactive and Radiocarbon Dating","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
