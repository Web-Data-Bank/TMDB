The Three Wise Men from the East follow the star to Bethlehem, but hostile spirits try to stop them on their journey. The King Herod fears the child in the manger, and seeks to kill it, but an angel prevents his evil intentions.  The film is an example of how Lotte Reiniger has her silhouette technique enriched by coloured acetate films. The backgrounds have the vibrancy of coloured stained glass windows.","popularity":1.181,"poster_path":"/egUPsKuH8pmLJlCkCHyEUh4bCr0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37779,"logo_path":null,"name":"Primrose Film Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":47512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cathedral Films","origin_country":""},{"id":15277,"logo_path":null,"name":"BFI Video","origin_country":""},{"id":115354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vision Video, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1956-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Star of Bethlehem","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
