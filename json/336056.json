In 1989-90, we filmed the last survivors of the Russian avant-garde movements of the 1920s and ’30s in Leningrad-Saint Petersburg, the city of Osip Emil’evic Mandel’štam – the author of the poem Journey to Armenia. The film is a fragment of a vast fresco recorded during the fall of the Soviet Union, with the portraits of the last witnesses of a great history that no-one had registered and who are now dead.","popularity":1.373,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes sur nos voyages en Russie 1989-1990","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
