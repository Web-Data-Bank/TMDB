And they defend their clientele, especially since their very existence is at risk. The safety precautions in safes and in banks are becoming ever stricter, making the working conditions for burglars and thieving magpies more and more difficult. Therefore, the interest group of property reducers - VDEI for short - made representations to the responsible minister and confronted him with a warning strike, which is intended to make it clear what economic function thieves and burglars have in society. The strike calls everyone involved in property security onto the scene: burglars and interest groups for guns, guard dog breeders and tank crackers gather. After heated discussions, an agreement can finally be reached - but the consumer has to pay for it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1966-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 Percent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
