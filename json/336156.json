And almost two years later, the families and the nation are left with few answers. In spite of a massive international investigative effort and a plenitude of theories, there is still no conclusive explanation of what happened to these 43 young men, raising the chilling possibility that the mystery of the students’ disappearance will never be solved. A Day in Ayotzinapa 43 is not a recount of the events, but an intimate foray into a community under siege, as it serves as the symbolic epicentre of a political tension that has erupted at all levels.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2015-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Day in Ayotzinapa 43","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
