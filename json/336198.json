Although reluctant to do so, island recluse Tess (Mirjana Jokovic) offers her home to Sam (David Thornton) and Nigel (Tomas Arana), a pair of tuxedo-suited (and blood-soaked) strangers who arrive via motorboat with an exotic animal in tow. Allowing them to heal their wounds but desperate to get them out of her home, Tess immediately hides her valuables and frequently makes for the cellar where she appears to speak with an unseen housemate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chiaroscuro Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Private Property","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
