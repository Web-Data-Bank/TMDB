Following the possibly real-life exploits of Josh Kornbluth, an autobiographical monologist, Love &amp; Taxes is a comedy that blends solo performance and scripted scenes to bring the subjective reality of the storyteller hilariously to life. A tale of procrastination, making movies and growing up, Love &amp; Taxes is a middle-aged coming-of-age story that is also, quite possibly, the first ever pro-tax romantic comedy.","popularity":1.471,"poster_path":"/kJwYUePVOA503HXMpa2Y4XHCGJv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95417,"logo_path":"/Q9YTXIe2ZGjWa1Ors6sqOpGrWp.png","name":"Abramorama","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love & Taxes","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
