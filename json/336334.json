Admittedly, he hasn't paid much attention to Petra, nor to their daughter, who's in full puberty, nor to their son, who craves his dad's attention. Petra agrees to give him one week to show them if he can change. And he's in luck: he meets himself, only cooler. Tom Senger is the name of the twin he never knew he had. Though Matthias and Tom look alike, they're completely different. Tom, for example, is a typical actor: arrogant, macho and broke. Matthias decides to switch roles in the hope that Tom can be a worthy replacement for a week. \"I'm playing you. Only better,\" says Tom, who sees right away what's missing in the Pretschke home. As the days go by, it gets more and more difficult to distinguish which one is which. And this may not be bad at all.","popularity":0.787,"poster_path":"/3QhrLvs0zJv89umo9DROlHyirCY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Two Twins","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":6}
