The shop only has one regular customer, aside from a lady who orders nothing but ice water and leeches off their Internet connection. As a result, Rico is having trouble paying off his mortgage. He now has just two weeks to raise 120,000 pesos to keep the bank from foreclosing on the property. He tries a variety of things to raise the cash, even going as far as considering selling his body. Luckily, one of his baristas Jek  accidentally stumbles on a solution to the shopâ€™s problems. A prank goes wrong and a special ingredient ends up making their coffee a real hit among a certain section of their clientele.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oxWtIKeoNAXOyKg4ef3Tbg6iKyt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2011-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Strong coffee from a macho man.","title":"Kape Barako","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
