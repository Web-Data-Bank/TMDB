This is a rambling, textured film about obsession. It is about the mythos of speed for its own sake, and it is about waiting. While waiting, The BLVD exposes community, inner-city landscapes and nomadic experiences of place. The film treats storytelling as a living medium for determining history. And it commands respect for those who transform cars, or anything else, through passion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7j4Sszv2F6ZXq1HiIvNb2tZhK0w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45492,"logo_path":"/d2W0LDHhQxPXTzfhJqRw3dWvdCv.png","name":"Pythagoras Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The BLVD","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
