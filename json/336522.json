This \"novelty act\" of the psychedelic circuit evolved into Hot Tuna. Jesse Block's concert documentary, 25 Years &amp; Runnin', celebrates the simple sustaining powers of blues, bars, and Tuna. Jorma and Jack reflecting on their influences and musical partnership since playing in a high school garage band while their fans explain the Jorma/Jack chemistry that's kept them tuned to Tuna for a quarter century. The documentary's subtitle, Live at Sweetwater (a Bay area landmark club), is the crux of this video with \"live\" performances of ragtime blues standards and Tuna originals that exemplify the free spirit that's kept Hot Tuna runnin' all these years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Tuna - 25 Years and Runnin' Live at Sweetwater","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
