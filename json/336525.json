And the brothers Garza do it with what remains rock & roll's most basic and reliable format: the rock guitar trio. True, there's nothing earth-shatteringly original going on here; guitarist Henry, like many others from Texas and everywhere else, is channeling Jimi Hendrix via Stevie Ray Vaughan, with a little Carlos Santana on the side (Jojo is the outstanding bassist, while Ringo--his real name, by the way--plays drums, of course). But Los Lonely Boys bring something else to the party: good singing (all three are capable lead and harmony vocalists), and enough other influences, from Tex-Mex to the Beatles, to forge a distinctive, melodically appealing sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hAX0ObDzIYgSLavS1YhU9kxW5u9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los Lonely Boys: Texican Style (Live from Austin)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
