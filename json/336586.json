But the Group A cars that followed provided their own surprises and in the 1990s, it all changed again as Group A evolved in the face of a restyled World Rally competition. We take a rare 'inside view' of the top rally cars of the early/mid Nineties - joining top teams in their workshops and testing; talking to drivers and team managers; and enjoying the culmination of their efforts with action footage from the international rally circuit.
