Desperate, but keenly aware of the answer's potential effect on the public, the programmer strikes a deal with his interrogators, agreeing to re-design the software in exchange for his freedom. As they search to understand why the program answered an ethical question and try to find a way to change its response, the faith and patience of both the programmer and his captors are put to the test. Suspenseful and darkly comic, S.E.R.P. is a film about coercion, innovation, and whether it is possible to do something good in the service of something evil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r1dEW4dKfo4k0bmG1uZaVtAW8bu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Even digital revolutions require sacrifice","title":"S.E.R.P.","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":3}
