These low-budget westerns usually featured three cowboy stars; this time, however, there are only two, Bob Steele and Hoot Gibson. Though neither star is a spring chicken, Steele is the younger of the two, so he's the \"Utah Kid\" by default. The plot, involving a gang of crooks who go around fixing rodeo results, was designed to accommodate yards and yards of stock footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5PdGRbdBXySwz39DJ78SWbA535g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SIX GUNS AND FISTS BEAT A TATTOO ON RANGE RATS AND RENEGADES!","title":"The Utah Kid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
