The film is based on 'the life and dreams' of Nini Sardlishvili, a sixteen-year-old Georgian girl. Nini tells about her life and dreams, speaks with two elderly women about past and future and walks among the ruins of a huge, burnt-out Soviet archive. She plays herself in the film, just like the other protagonist, Domestic Intelligence agent Gocha Ovashvili. He travels across the country in response to a remarkable appeal by a Georgian minister (appearing in a newscast), to ask people if they are criminals. During this futile and absurd quest, he meets mainly aged Georgians, including a shepherd and two monks, and admires the scenery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Geen Dank Produkties","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Light Behaves Differently Towards Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
