The appeal led to piles of reactions and a convoy of eager women. The impressive three-day party yielded a few marriages, but the frivolous action could not deliver Plan from the worrying exodus. The tough farm work still appeals to only a few women, no matter how imposing the view on the inaccessible Pyrenees may be, both in summer and winter. Director Carin Goeijers filmed the inhabitants during their daily activities at home and on the land and asked them about their loves and lives. She alternates the present with beautiful historical footage of the legendary women's convoy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b0Jm5VajRM9B6aZFDHlFSuEkbMW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51752,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jura Filmprodukties","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valley of Sighs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
