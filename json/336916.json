Alli Coates filmed performance artist Signe Pierce as she strutted down a busy oceanside street in stripper garb and a reflective mask. The pair agreed not to communicate until the experiment was completed, but never anticipated the horror that would unfold in under an hour.  The result is a heart wrenching technicolor spectacle that raises questions about gender stereotypes, mob mentality, and violence in America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jJ2X78A7SLYS1ivKxeN4KBoscMJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Reflexxx","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4}
