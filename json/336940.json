It asks, among other questions, is the Amazonian woman a rare strong female image or is she a figure derived from male phantasy? The film explores the complexities of such questions, but does not seek any concrete answers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bMqO54oQWmVYKIfqem2ESnqAf4b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laura Mulvey-Peter Wollen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penthesilea: Queen of the Amazons","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
