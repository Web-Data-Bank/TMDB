It displays impressionistic street spectacle and images of quotidian life, as well as excursions by train and ship, unfolding as a private visual journal and a sort of souvenir, but with refined framing, camera movement, and rhythmic editing. With his own perspective and artistic sensitivity embedded in this film, struggling between being a Japanese colonial subject and a Taiwanese/Chinese litterateur, Liu attempts to transcend geological, national, racial/ethnic, linguistic and medial boundaries, to establish a depoliticized, internationalist, cosmopolitan cinematic utopia, a pure cinema, and a fluid and contested identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4vBsIkJxBWkHdNNEUgeWwcDt4nX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1933-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Has a Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
