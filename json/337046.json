Sullivan regarded this operetta - a hit ever since its first production in New York in 1879 - as the best comedy he composed. He even said of his collaborator, \"The libretto is ingenious, clever, wonderfully fun in parts and sometimes brilliant in dialogue - beautifully written for music, as is all Gilbert does.\" Indeed, audiences will find the music every bit a match for the lyrics, with the genius of the score lying in its parody of grand opera. Filmed in 1985 at the world-famous Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario.","popularity":1.37,"poster_path":"/9o4zr8B4yeMs6Av9djNdIYMFIzi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":31092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stratford Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pirates of Penzance","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
