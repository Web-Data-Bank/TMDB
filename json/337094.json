To make sure that \"those out there don´t think two nuns no longer make a convent\", they try to keep up a full range of activities. The women´s headstrong character and their stubborn insistence on autonomy and self-dependency creates situations that are both touching and funny, and entirely unexpected in a place like this.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carmen Tartarotti Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Cannot Dream a Bright Blue Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
