Like Marjorie, he is an upper-middle-class New York Jew, but has fallen away from his roots, and Marjorie's parents object among other things to his lack of a suitable profession. Noel himself warns Marjorie repeatedly that she's much too naive and conventional for him, but they nonetheless fall in love.","popularity":3.461,"poster_path":"/GcFa930a5FJRxLs1bTGAscMxdM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17271,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beachwold Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
