She was sexually attacked and had no memory of it, until photographic evidence spread through social media. The resulting humiliation and bullying the Nova Scotia teen received led to her tragic suicide less than two years later. News of her death reverberated worldwide, a stunning demonstration of the power of images and social networks to amplify the extent of rape culture and effects of depression. Now, her parents and those who knew her reassemble the pieces of Parsons’s life in their courageous quest to make accountable the systems that failed to protect her. With the support of Anonymous, an online campaign and public pressure, they forced the Nova Scotian government and RCMP to address the case and bring the perpetrators to justice. Parsons’s story epitomizes the immense capacity of new tools in these nascent years of social networking.","popularity":0.68,"poster_path":"/uLHUrb4ZTZOADpGNUwuRBA0GIhC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Place to Hide: The Rehtaeh Parsons Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
