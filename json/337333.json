With the added bonus of previously unreleased footage from Arthur’s career – ranging from Desk Sergeant in Dixon of Doc Green, to the one time host of Ask The Family – and a rumour of a surprise start guest appearance, the celebration of Arthur’s illustrious career is a show not to miss.  As Arthur himself says, “Wouldn't it be wonderful if you could just turn the telly on after a hard day at the abattoir…or whatever it is you do… and there I was, smiling back at you, in my own programme again, again.”","popularity":0.898,"poster_path":"/8BDvJLDvr43Z5jPwKW8hmyKZxax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Komedia Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Count Arthur Strong - The Man Behind The Smile","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
