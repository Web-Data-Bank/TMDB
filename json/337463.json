Here, there are no big shopping malls, no tall buildings. There are only huge mountains and vast fields as far as the eye can see, and clouds that seem to be always embracing the mountains. Life is simple for the four boys. They are content and very happy if they could eat three meals a day and are able to play. All of them, except for Uding who is an orphan, have left their homes in the mountains because they couldnâ€™t bear the harsh treatment of their parents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3kBeToNowFqOxhdgFXnXqLGLkqE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57920,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinelarga","origin_country":""},{"id":19781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema One Originals","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":57919,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative Programs","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2011-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Skies and Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
