The film conceived, but never realized, by Rossellini took shape in his notes after a trip to Chile conducted in May of 1971, a trip made to conduct an interview-portrait of Salvador Allende, then actually carried out by the director of \"Rome, Open City\". October 28, 1971: Rossellini, back from Santiago, Chile, reads a newspaper reports of a beached whale on the Pacific coast near a poor village inhabited by fishermen. From this simple news comes a film script for a fable about wealth and poverty. A film whose shooting Rossellini would have been entrusted to the young student Claudio Bond√¨, just graduated from the Experimental Center of Cinematography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29202,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2010-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La balena di Rossellini","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
