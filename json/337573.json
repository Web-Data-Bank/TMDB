A mental patient (Serena Vergano) is escorted into an operating room, where electrodes are attached to her scalp. The doctors dissect his brain and we enter the brain with a loud, jarring cry. In this space detached from reality, a group of actors perform elaborate interpretive dances. They jump, land on top of each other, place their hands on their bodies and form various shapes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u8anzBtFGKKMG5LewMyg7e8r0eQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52174,"logo_path":"/6JSsVKvpHLNvcAzBlJzyjYDLCZ6.png","name":"Taller d'Arquitectura de Ricardo Bofill","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Esquizo","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
