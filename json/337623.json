It is the life story of the legendary musician, but it is not a biography, it is a fairytale documentary! The director followed Lee Perry for thirteen years and discovered an unbelievable story, a revelation, told about and with one of the major protagonists of contemporary music, the other half of the story that has never been told. The movie can be seen as a guide for how to change the world with music, with a positive attitude, mindset or, as Lee Perry calls it, vibration.","popularity":1.383,"poster_path":"/7Kh9NaPgU1vLiteCPwI6x9AIatJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schmid KoDeX","origin_country":""},{"id":1695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fufoo Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lee Scratch Perry's Vision of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
