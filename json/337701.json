With the unexpected death of both parents, the sisters are left to keep this dying farm out of foreclosure. But when Nancy finds that her sister’s commitment is not nearly as strong as her own, the inequality of labour causes tensions to rise, and Nancy’s conviction to keep the farm could cost her everything, including her family. In this powerful film on the peril faced by America’s farmers, Emmy-winning filmmaker Morgan Schmidt-Feng (The Next Frontier) presents a passionate tale of one woman’s commitment to duty, family, legacy and the lengths she will go to keep it all together. - Heather Haynes (Hot Docs)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Her Own","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
