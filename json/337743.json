The lawyer juggles millions of dollars every day - it should be easy for him to get grandpa's ailing tavern going with Western know-how. But the down-to-earth Ossis are not in the mood for tapas and Thai food. Marc only realizes this when he gets to know and love the young, single parent Carmen. When Marc's fiancée Lisa shows up, decisions are pending.","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/kpJ05WnOVLVPJQwGxKLrCVSmTAH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6187,"logo_path":"/gtC63XG8fkFxszIuZIogffM1oY8.png","name":"ARD Degeto","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Einspruch für die Liebe","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
