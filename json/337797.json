Share the fun as Doc teaches the toys to patch themselves up when they're down, and shows them how visiting the dentist, seeing an optometrist and even getting an X-ray can work wonders! Banish the blurries as you help Professor Hootsburgh choose the perfect pair of glasses, get soccer star Johnny Foosball back in the game, and fix a friendly bath-time shark's cracked tooth. Then, when Doc sprains her ankle, join the toys as they rush to her rescue. But don't worry -- with rest, patience, and plenty of cuddles, she's back on her feet before you can say, \"The Doc is in!\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doc Mcstuffins: School of Medicine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
