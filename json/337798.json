A late-night radio host takes in calls from citizens expressing their concerns, predictions and speculations on what may happen when—or even if—the sun comes up. Simultaneously, a crisis centre dispatcher fields panicked calls from people experiencing real-life traumatic situations in need of immediate attention. The voices of these callers are interwoven with an intimate therapy session and a wandering taxicab to build a profile of a place where citizens want to be heard. Never showing the callers on the other end of the line, the film creates an aural overview of a darkened city. As the night progresses, the calls continue coming in, revealing the various struggles people are experiencing in dealing with conceptual fears and current woes—all in a world that soon may be over.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/duQEp7xDGfOy1oV86qcGiqK5PEX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wajda Studio","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2015-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End of the World","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
