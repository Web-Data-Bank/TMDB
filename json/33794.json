A penniless ex-con dies a gristly death in a house he can ill afford. The detectives assigned the case are Min, newly reinstated after a suspension, and Lee, a new transfer from forensics. Min has nightmares: a sexual assault that haunts her. She and Lee work well together, but soon two more deaths occur - each mysteriously poisoned, both friends of the ex-con. A fourth friend, a newly married doctor, is a suspect. But what has all this to do with the salt storehouse, a death ten years ago, and a missing girl? Can Min and Lee get to the bottom of it, or is the supernatural beyond a cop's reach?","popularity":3.416,"poster_path":"/osSqqnw0LOWxhdCLkFt1klKG4rG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7819,"logo_path":"/ghFZAt4edln0M7BzDExyYMzUGX1.png","name":"Lotte Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":73258,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Dream \u0026 Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2006-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Her Spirit Will Be Avenged","title":"Arang","video":false,"vote_average":5.868,"vote_count":34}
