Acclaimed photographer Gillian Laub, whose photos first brought the area unwanted notoriety, documents the repercussions when a white town resident is charged with the murder of a young black man. The case divides locals along well-worn racial lines, and the ensuing plea bargain and sentencing uncover complex truths and produce emotional revelations.","popularity":1.434,"poster_path":"/bIbeNp5fXIMtTplrso2ypiO31iH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Group Effort Films","origin_country":""},{"id":39036,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atom Factory","origin_country":""},{"id":53215,"logo_path":null,"name":"Get Lifted Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Southern Rites","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
