Toss in a plot that has Weissmuller as a psycho-neurotic war veteran who, because he piled up his Navy destroyer on the rocks, now dreads returning to his pre-war occupation of a pilot guiding ships through the channels at the mouth of the Mississippi. Throw in icy Virginia Grey as a spoiled heiress out to take Johnny away from his job, his friends and the girl he loves (who knows why), and you have enough plot and action for two Pine-Thomas jewels.","popularity":1.487,"poster_path":"/wZbzwGkfeRMUTkJqxQtRYlrcATf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pine-Thomas Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"WILD SAVAGE LAW...Tough Flaming Adventure!!","title":"Swamp Fire","video":false,"vote_average":5.375,"vote_count":8}
