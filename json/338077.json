It pivots mainly around music, leaving software and movies completely in the dark. Main themes evolve around the judicial debate, but why not tackle this from a more philosophical (moral for instance) or cultural point of view ? Also from a technological point of view it declines to bring any interesting revelations. And what up with the disgusting musac layered all the time into the interviews ? It completely turns your attention away from the subject and gives you the impression of watching some cheap promotional video you might encounter on a late night tell-sell channel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Piracy: On Piracy & the Future of Media","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
