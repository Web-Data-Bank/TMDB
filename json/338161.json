Shankar is an undercover CBI Officer, a fact that was hidden from the rest of the family, until only recently. Vinay would like Pooja to get married to Deepak Malhotra, who works in his office, and is quite unaware that Deepak and Pooja have already met and are very much in love. Although Deepak comes from a poor family, and lives with his widowed and blind mother, Vinay does not foresee this as a problem. Then suddenly things change dramatically when Vinay suspects Deepak of accepting bribes from a corrupt builder named Shaadilal, fires Deepak, pending a police investigation. And to make matters worse, Shankar too is aware of Deepak - not as a groom for his niece, but as a suspect for murder!! But before he could arrest Deepak, he must execute a warrant for the arrest of none other than Vinay himself.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":"/pMAf0PfuZkp9nqHrdLKocefQG7a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paap Ko Jalaa Kar Raakh Kar Doonga","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
