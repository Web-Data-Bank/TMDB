That episode ends in a cliff hanger as Thunderbolt, in hot pursuit of Dirty Dawson, plunges into a river towards a treacherous waterfall. In this short episode that ties to the original, Thunderbolt escapes the fall down the waterfall with the help of the Sheriff, avoids an explosion triggered rock slide, and ultimately captures the horse thief, Dirty Dawson.","popularity":0.839,"poster_path":"/u86EIARGQFShu4nCzIEodLU566c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"101 Dalmatians: The Further Adventures of Thunderbolt","video":false,"vote_average":6.667,"vote_count":6}
