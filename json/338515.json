Olivia, an orphan from Afghanistan, is on the run and finds shelter with Bob Fagin and his gang of mercenary metal thieves. She is put to the test and challenged to fight for her freedom and protect her innocence. Against the backdrop of the 2011 UK riots, cross-cultural tension and the pottery tradition, the adaptation stays true to the gritty tone and social commentary underlying the original classic novel by Charles Dickens.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dVjUdE2ifqhHcauUiyK77ImZTad.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olivia Twist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
