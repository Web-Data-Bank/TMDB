A long way off from the front-line, at some God-forgotten junction, the Germans make an air landing operation in an attempt to get through to the Kirov railway and the White Sea - the Baltic Sea Canal. These aren't just ordinary paratroopers. This is a team of seasoned and highly trained infiltrators, the elite of the Waffen-SS, superhumans. The only thing in their way is an anti-aircraft artillery unit of corporal Vaskov and five young women in training. It may seem like a fight of local significance, but the countrys main strategic transportation artery is at stake. Can the corporal and his 'petite newbies' prevent Nazi sabotage and at what cost?","popularity":7.372,"poster_path":"/hPeYCHutYtsHibDiSDAfJ4SYedk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Реал-Дакота","origin_country":""},{"id":16079,"logo_path":"/6BF18oLINXIs1FZCZBAV1JOJx5h.png","name":"Star Media","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":11989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Interfest","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2015-04-30","revenue":5249225,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dawns Here Are Quiet","video":false,"vote_average":6.831,"vote_count":148}
