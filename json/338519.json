Filmmaker Luis Blanco Nazoa tagged along with them, and the documentary Alemania follows the often chaotic circumstances as the Hispanic-American reporters find themselves not only monitoring the play on the field during the world's most watched sporting event but the enthusiastic and often eccentric fans who traveled from all over the globe to cheer on their favorite teams. The reporters also find themselves dealing with a double culture clash as Americans abroad that don't fit the traditional stereotypes of Americans. Alemania received its North American premiere at the 2010 Palm Beach International Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alemania","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
