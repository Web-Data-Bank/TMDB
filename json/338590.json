Project 22 follows two combat-wounded Veterans on a mission to find hope. Riding motorcycles from San Francisco to New York, Daniel and Doc speak with Veterans about post-war challenges that lead to suicide and the healing Veterans are finding in alternative forms of therapy such as sailing, pottery, education, service dogs and more. During the 6,500 mile journey, our riders interview leading researchers, mental health clinicians and educators who specialize in Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress, as well as, a leading expert in Warrior Culture and Combat Stress. Asking hard hitting questions and opening up about their own struggles, Daniel and Doc will stop at nothing to reach tomorrow's twenty-two.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":"/skQGWlFyllS28Ym4CCNXdCoFXuO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Project 22 follows two Combat Veterans on a motorcycle mission to raise awareness and to search for hope.","title":"Project 22","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
