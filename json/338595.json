The school year is winding down and the Senior Prom looms on the horizon; Brittany (Jessica Weight) is head of the prom committee and determined that everything will be perfect, which turns out to be harder than she imagined. Would-be cool guy Miles (Michael Ward) is infatuated with Brittany and volunteers for the prom committee in hopes of impressing her, through his ineptitude only makes matters worse. Insufferably cute couple Shawn (Alan Garcia) and Shelly (Alix Deenin) have been an item since they were in fourth grade, and they're both looking forward to the prom, but there's a rumor afoot that Shawn has been seeing Natalie (Megan Gisler) on the side that could derail everything. And goofball Zach (Max Watson) has a serious crush on class cynic Lynsey (Lynsey Lorraine), but his idea of a good way to ask her out is to make a placard and carry it around.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Senior Prom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
