How can these disturbing trend be reversed? In recent years, the idea of a collaborative care practice where doctors and midwives manage women's care together has begun to gain traction in the United States. The Mama Sherpas is a feature-length documentary film about women receiving their maternity care through midwife-doctor teams. We follow nurse midwives, the doctors they work with, and their patients to provide an investigative lens into how midwives work within the hospital system.","popularity":1.345,"poster_path":"/sYiWS3hKkATIWScRfUX8YyKopVU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109218,"logo_path":"/e5wQmLhPlDenYHzINfGG0P25Wpa.png","name":"BOBB Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mama Sherpas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
