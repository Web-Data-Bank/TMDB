What started in a makeshift studio in a suburban loft grew into the biggest tour in Third Day's history, placing the band in front of over 300,000 fans throughout the United States. During the tour, the Come Together message was made tangible by a partnership with Habitat for Humanity that led to the construction of eight homes around the world.  Third Day: Live In Concert, showcases the visually and acoustically stimulating Come Together Tour, but also traces Come Together from its humble beginnings to the live experience on the road.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Third Day: Live in Concert: The Come Together Tour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
