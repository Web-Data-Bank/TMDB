It will make every viewer rethink motherhood and how we treat mothers. It is a film that will empower each woman to trust her body, her baby, and herself in her journey as a mother. It will make her laugh, cry, nod fiercely in agreement, get angry, and then get so inspired it will be impossible not to take action.","popularity":3.22,"poster_path":"/3qx94kK4Q8Iu931htlTTmcqSzug.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Milky Way","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
