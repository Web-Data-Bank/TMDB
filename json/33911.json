Berta is a single nurse raising her deceased sister's three teenage children in a Spanish port city. The two boys are neo-Nazis with a flaming hatred for African immigrants, and the girl has a boyfriend who runs an underground business smuggling illegal aliens from Africa. Into this time bomb comes a cop, Eduardo, who is investigating the vicious assault of a black man. He and Berta fall for each other and make tigerish love in scenes that are much hotter than you might expect from middle-aged actors.","popularity":1.036,"poster_path":"/2HscsQClBeidGmew1hpt78g7SQJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Savages","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
