His wife, Edie, is not happy about this. Their son Matt, is wrestling with a relationship in which he earns less than his successful girlfriend and daughter Rosa is wrestling with debt and the end of a turbulent love affair. Living on your own, it seems, may not be as glamorous as it's cracked up to be. Rosa is the first of the Boyd children to think she may have to move back in with her parents-just until she can make ends meet again. Set in Boston, Massachusetts, this is the empty nest, twenty-first-century style-with grown children coming and going just as parents are getting ready for their second honeymoon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Second Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
