Their only option is a desperate late night escape and evasion through a jungle filled with NVA soldiers.","popularity":0.825,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escape from Firebase Kate","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
