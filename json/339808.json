Ibu Masato frowns away as a proud, retired man with a bad back and a chip on his shoulder about his wife and daughter leaving him at home. He barely speaks out loud, but through narrative voiceover we hear his obsession with time, his grievances with being bored and alone, his concern for appearances, and his crabby curiosity about all the cats running amuck in the house. Through a small, ridiculous turn of events, he ends up stranded on his roof with no way down. The myriad helpless facial expressions the veteran actor rolls out during his attempts to get back down are absolutely hilarious. Who knew an old man on a roof could be so funny?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tiwoDQI7mQj5cCuypuYa7SBOGgl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neco-Ban: Cats in Your Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
