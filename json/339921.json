Unprecedented in its scope and bravery, it is the most ambitious nonstop tour ever attempted. $60,000 of credit card debt later, hilarity, chaos, and metaphysical crises begin to ensue as the band strays far from the tourist-trodden path into the homes, underground clubs, and hangouts of real and driven people from some of Earth's most exotic locales. Sleep deprivation and non-stop travel eventually take their toll, snowballing into an absurd and meaningless seven-and-a-half-hour climax of binge-drinking, fear, thoughtful reflection, hatred, literary criticism, severe depression, and infantile behavior. A modern day Heart of Darkness taking a decidedly frank, open, and honest look at the classic misgivings of a terrible life: What the fuck are we doing? and What happened to me?","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/5X9vjc0IA0eVsH6j21nk7w80DWc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":615,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An unprecedented experience that changed our lives forever & may now change yours.","title":"HORSE The Band - Earth Tour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
