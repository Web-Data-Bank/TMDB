Filmed in six countries over four years, this is the documentary that finally clears the smoke around the international prohibition of cannabis.  Over the last 100 years the US government has forced its drug control policies on almost every country on earth. 40 years since Richard Nixon declared the War On Drugs in 1972, 22 million Americans have been arrested for marijuana. Only one country in the world has higher arrest and conviction rates: New Zealand.  DRUGLAWED examines how New Zealand fell in lockstep with US policies, and shows how smaller countries can break out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pHZCAw6WZO75IkMXrvGjgBBHeNY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Section 18 Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How New Zealand Got Rolled Up In The U.S. Drug War","title":"Druglawed","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
