Their testimonies help us understand how the market economy has put the Hungarian population in an ambivalent situation. With a liberal left-wing dismantling the socialist heritage and a social right-wing reverting to nationalism, the traditional line between the Right and the Left has been blurred. What remains is an ideological confusion that we all have to face.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/5MYPAOz3fI71A6xNIKJ7zDEMWKM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"East Punk Memories","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
