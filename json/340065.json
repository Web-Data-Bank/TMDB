The undisputed toughest off-road single race in the world, a weekend full of rocks, mud and sweat. Held in Erzberg, Styria (Austria) every June since 1995, the Erzberg Rodeo and its special highlight - the relentless Red Bull Hare Scramble - has been legendary for quite some time. On Saturday, 1,500 riders start down the gravel track of the Iron Road Prolog. Then on Sunday, the 500 fastest racers fly up the iron giant flash - an ear splitting battle before more than 45,000 spectators. But the steep muddy hillsides, narrow stretches of forest and extreme rocky passes result in collisions and racers throwing in the towel en masse. The mountain takes its toll: not even 30 bikers make it through to cross the finish line after 35 km.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p9qwbW9QShShmBfjIfwWVovQthm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Bull Hare Scramble: Erzberg Rodeo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
