As Margaret Thatcher knew, her ideas changed how people thought and what they aspired to. Inequality was a necessary engine to progress, greed and envy emotions to be celebrated, capitalism could find its own solution to every problem. Tracing from the convulsions of the 80s through to the 2008 financial crisis and beyond, this film examines the spread of her influence and ideology.  -","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Generation Right","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
