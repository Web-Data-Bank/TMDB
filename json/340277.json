At the start of \"Perversions of a Young Bride\", aka \"French Blues\" (?) we witness a couple (Ghislain van Hove and Danièle David ) just finishing a bout of intercourse, only to find out they are just friends. In fact, she's the best friend of his fiancée. Turns out they had some time on their hands while the bride, Marie-Christine (the legend known as Brigitte Lahaie) is getting ready. So, the groom (already in his tux) and the best friend flip through Marie-Christine's scrapbook of love, a photo album featuring pictures of lovers and their private parts. Of course, each one has a story attached, and luckily Danièle knows them all. After all, every guy loves to hear about the sex live of the woman he loves.","popularity":1.295,"poster_path":"/klwgcxfUZwk3mlHQgkRcicgUkl4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perversion of a Young Bride","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":5}
