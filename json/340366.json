It presents diverse experiences of Black men through a video question-and-answer exchange, a “question bridge,” to break down stereotypes of Black male identity perpetuated by America’s white dominant culture. Thomas and his collaborators traveled across the United States, recording questions from nearly 160 men, bringing the questions to others to answer, and filming additional questions from those respondents that other participants, in turn, could later address. The project enables a large group of men to speak to each other across geographic, economic, political, and generational divisions.","popularity":1.343,"poster_path":"/gE23qeeMy7dPsIV53Xr0TkMvTmw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Question Bridge: Black Males","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
