After travelling by foot through a dark, woodland forest, a figure enters into a desolate, desert-like world. Its journey is intercepted by a looming structure – representing visions of society, memory and need – which is explored, but ultimately rejected, leaving the figure to continue on its quest towards an unknown destination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2011-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disquiet","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
