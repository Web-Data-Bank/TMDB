On another night at a club, upset with her friends, she meets the same fellow again — “Come on, we shall have a nice drink! Let’s dance… Just relax. Just take a chill pill.” She snorts coke, gets hammered; few days later, even moves out of her parents’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello Zindagi","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
