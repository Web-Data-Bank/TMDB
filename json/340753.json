We follow a group of four aimless, suburban teenagers - they skateboard the park, sleep in the sun, and rummage through the decaying remains completely unaware that this is where a lonesome teen is confronting a horrific past. Day turns to night, people disappear, and the secrets of Sunset Edge are revealed in a paralyzing finale.","popularity":0.632,"poster_path":"/w2FZnvvFv1Q6TLyg25mM60fXfRO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Son of a Gun Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunset Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
