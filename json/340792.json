In this society, The Equal Futures Academy for Girls and the Equal Futures Academy for Boys were formed to re-educate the two genders without the inherent biases of society. The Equal Futures Academy propels more girls into the arena of captains of technology than any other school in the world. Frankie, Libby and Sheridan of the Girls Who Code are a premiere coterie of students with brains, beauty and binary bravado. The expert hackers have found a way to interact with the boys from their sister school and trouble ensues. Code Academy is a peek into the inner world of adolescence, gender identity formation and the role of cyber space in this tumultuous time of growth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dYXqElbvX631OWSOidA66mmRP6P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":76517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mata Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FUTURESTATES: Code Academy","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
