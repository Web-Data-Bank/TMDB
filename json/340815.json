Dean, world-renowned climber, BASE-jumper and line-walker has been pushing the limits of outdoor arts for decades. When Dogs Fly tracks this untraditional family’s journey to make Whisper the world’s first wingsuit BASE-jumping dog. This offbeat film pushes everyone to question what’s right or wrong – and ultimately if “…this joy will lead to harm or death.”","popularity":0.879,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53700,"logo_path":null,"name":"The SC Group of Companies","origin_country":""},{"id":53701,"logo_path":"/x2DTMJXBRQY8UkhdKlISAupIzIU.png","name":"Whisper Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A legend in extreme sports, Dean Potter now shares his adventures.","title":"When Dogs Fly","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
