Their hunger for understanding and spiritual being leads them to a phenomena that has existed since the beginning of man. It is self evident that all men are created equal, yet some perform extraordinary achievements and others live a life of emptiness never reaching their full potential. There is a force that everyone is entitled to, that can bring the fulfillment their lives desire. That evolutionary force is Kundalini. Beyond science, beyond religion; Kundalini is the SOURCE of the FORCE. This untapped powerful resource available for centuries within every human body is still unexplained, mysterious and kept secret till today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3DjIR23euVjRMkOyY1Apv6EV5HI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kundalini","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
