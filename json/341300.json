A devoted father and an adoring husband, Dipak works as a security guard, while Saraswati happily tends to traditional housework. Their home is modest, and their two girls are happy. Life would be perfect for the pregnant mother if only she could give her husband a son. Desperate in her desire, on the advice of a stranger, Saraswati prays to a new spirit with miraculous results. When the blessing turns to tragedy, the distraught couple appeals to Gita, a jhangrini or healer, revered as a powerful spirit medium. Gita's own crisis of faith and, perhaps, her stunning beauty, forces all three to a dizzying climax, leaving the lines between secular and spiritual desires eerily blurred.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8G1wZpFyyx99PvnnhxvCvyNncpy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mask of Desire","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
