Her other piece, Nocturne, offers compelling evidence of her gifts as a filmmaker: her extraordinary compositional sense, her precise editing, and her uncanny intimation of the menace and beauty of cities at night. Based in London she is undoubtedly a major talent. — Shane Danielsen; 57th Edinburgh International Film Festival 2003, Black Box Activity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sgwKXPvSZA5ciayBJ7fMGCZMrvk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Redshift","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
