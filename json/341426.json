It was the year when Berkeley students rose up in protest, African Americans fought back against injustice in Harlem, and Barry Goldwater’s conservative revolution took over the Republican Party. In myriad ways, 1964 was the year when Americans faced choices: between the liberalism of Lyndon Johnson or Barry Goldwater’s grassroots conservatism, between support for the civil rights movement or opposition to it, between an embrace of the emerging counterculture or a defense of traditional values.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lMAUOAzkZHucAega3W2QwEUcdZ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4857,"logo_path":"/vgoXIqSerj6iCpDIE6ZGeiRAAwW.png","name":"Insignia Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The pivotal year that essentially ushered in the true 1960s is explored.","title":"1964","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
