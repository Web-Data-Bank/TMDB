In the first tale, a blonde woman with an unclear past arrives in a remote, male-deprived Andean town and offers piano lessons, only to become the focus of wild rumors and innuendo. In the second, a married college professor who is haunted by nightmares becomes obsessed with a beguiling woman who seems to be sending him an ominous message. In the final story, a couple vacationing at a jungle resort refuse to believe in the ancient myths of Ecuador, but are forced to confront the legendary Guasang칩.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grupo Equinoccio","origin_country":""},{"id":97062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grupo Alyaz","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"1999-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams from the Middle of the World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
