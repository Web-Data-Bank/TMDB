Malin is fatherless, angry, and in trouble. At 20, he's spent a year in jail for assaulting a lover of Lily, his mother. In her desk he finds a soldier's photograph and assumes he's found his father. He confronts the man, now a teacher, and gets nowhere. At home again, he mocks his mother. Finally, she tells him her grim story, from the year before his birth. We see a people's court, where Lily's parents seek justice for their grandchild to be. We follow Lily to a prison camp, to the city where she's told to inform on the only person who's been kind, to an asylum, and finally to her current poverty and loneliness. How will Malin respond to these revelations?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ka4qBjHDl5ejNtM7Jxb972tiOyT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana Film","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":64275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bulgarian National Film Center","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":73627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Творчески колектив \"Поглед\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1993-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canary Season","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2}
