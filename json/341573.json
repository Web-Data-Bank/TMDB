Several former state and party functionaries interfere in the filmmaking in the hopes of manipulating Katerina's confessions for their own purposes. Nikola, the director, and his friends have to make the choice - whether to compromise with their consciences and their art, (as normally happens here in the Balkans), or whether to preserve Katerina's message.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana Film","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":74701,"logo_path":"/tXlAkHJqG0Vf8fPnRPKwskEJlDK.png","name":"BNT","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":94673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Digitrop","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2002-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"},{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warming Up Yesterday's Lunch","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
