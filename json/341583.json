It further covers his marriages to Isabella Brandt and Hélène Fourment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1977-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":260,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rubens, schilder en diplomaat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
