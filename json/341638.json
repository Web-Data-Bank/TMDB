Naked City is John Zorn (alto), Bill Frisell (guitar), Wayne Horvitz (keyboards), Fred Frith (bass), Joey Baron (drums), and Yamatsuka Eye (vocals). Taking the band’s name and first album cover as a clue, I drew heavily on themes in WeeGee’s photographs (his major collection, Naked City, inspired the title of Jules Dassin’s great 50’s film noir classic which inspired the TV show of the same name, of which I obtained and employed a portion of an episode), recreating many of his pictures in their actual Lower East Side/Little Italy locations (a rare home movie shot of WeeGee--smoking a cigar--is also included.)","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/oFdcWMQ30vJraCF2GjhQJDtSjb3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gotham","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
