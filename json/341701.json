The story relates with a gentle melancholy and a slight irony the lives of  a middle-class family: the cafe owner, his wife and their son. Through their individual destinies we become acquainted with the social and historical background of a by-gone era; the social and national differences of pre-war Maribor, divisions among the wealthy and poor, and nationally minded Slovenes  and fanatic Germanophils. The first year after the war  introduced  the absurd characteristic cruel measures of the so-called revolutionary social transformations  in which calamity and coincidence intervene, resulting in events of  comic nature, of course, as seen from a safe distance of fifty years.","popularity":0.732,"poster_path":"/IJBwxZ3IQow0r6Z3RsMI8iGR8r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viba Film","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1989-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Café Astoria","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
