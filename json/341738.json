Melissa has always been on of my favorite performers, and her sultry beauty is even more enhanced in front of camera抯 of Marc Dorcel entertainment. Here she plays an evil governess for a wheelchair bound and porn obsessed Horst Baron. She enjoys nothing more than tormenting Regina Ice, Horst new and somewhat awkward nurse.
