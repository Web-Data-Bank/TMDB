Two vinyl records are turning on a turntable. On the one hand the soundtrack is heard of three decades ago, on the other the voices of musicians today. The turntable is mounted at the foot of a block in the Bronx. It is the end of a Block Party, a ghetto party centring on hip-hop. In the same image those artists are brought together who stood at the cradle of this musical genre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dZme9OmMAfXLazcsjJUstI3Sms8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54111,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pierre Huyghe","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Block Party","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
