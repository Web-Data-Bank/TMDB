A man (favourite actor Wang Shin-hong) meets a woman (standard actor Wu Ke-xi) on a moored ship, a sort of floating palace decorated like a Buddhist temple. The woman or her spirit struggles with her memories and the man takes on the form of a Buddhist monk in his next life. Complex and yet simple. The man, the woman and the camera move gracefully 'dancing' through the space. Only the thought of escape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r357gvqwKJlljx5DyN05nEjlOB8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Palace on the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
