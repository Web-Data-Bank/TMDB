In the closed universe that is his, a formidable sensory exploration begins. How does he perceive his world and ours? What are its learning and memorization capacities? What happens when he is born in our world of air and gravity, which is far different from the world of his gestation, where all his needs were satisfied \"to the nanosecond\"? This documentary explains with precision, and a certain wonder, what we know today about the experiences and faculties of the little man, before and after birth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28190,"logo_path":"/owxjMUpB2uvfF0sdGrT6gQo2GY4.png","name":"13 Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le monde selon bébé","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
