He uses his ingenuity to uncover the mystery. Cubby and his girlfriend go underground and create a crop of synthetic vegetables in their underground cave-factory, then force them upward through the soil. An evil clothes-wearing opossum conspires to steal the entire load of vegetables in his pickup truck, but Cubby's worm friend tips them off. Cubby bombs the opossum with a pineapple, blowing him sky-high. Beans, peas, and other assorted objects take on lives and personalities of their own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nlm1HnriLjUlmSHjnDJ75mE9iM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How's Crops","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
