Aldo pulled out of the bout and a interim championship bout between Chad Mendes and McGregor took place at this event.  The UFC received official medical confirmation from several doctors that Aldo did not have a broken rib as he claimed and the biggest problem was the weight cutting process being complicated by the injury. This was confirmed when a release of an Xray tied to an old injury was released by Aldo's camp.  The co-main event featured a 170 lbs UFC Welterweight Championship bout between current champion Robbie Lawler and top contender Rory MacDonald.  145 lbs: Dennis Bermudez vs. Jeremy Stephens | 170 lbs: Gunnar Nelson vs. Brandon Thatch | 135 lbs.: Thomas Almeida vs. Brad Pickett","popularity":4.216,"poster_path":"/ayWdGh66dtEp3pFAXCCaCHLnA8B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20529,"logo_path":"/5VmtlWl6dbREk3BWjtN7BoW73ot.png","name":"Zuffa","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":179,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where's Aldo?","title":"UFC 189: Mendes vs. McGregor","video":true,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":4}
