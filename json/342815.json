Due to a clerical mix-up (his police file has been confused with another McLaughlin) Bobby McLaughlin (Brendan Fraser) is wrongfully accused of a murder he didn't commit. Despite his pleas of innocence, not even his father (Martin Sheen) believes him. With a minor crime already on his record, and an incompetent defense attorney, Bobby is convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. But a suppressed lie detector test that could have freed him convinces his father that Bobby is indeed innocent. Now he begins a fierce struggle to free his son from prison. \"Presumed Guilty\" is a chilling indictment of a faulty judicial system and an inspirational tale of love and reconciliation between father and son.","popularity":1.961,"poster_path":"/vSH8H2nEiOP9NGk9uTYvG8u6FkR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sucks to be you.","title":"Guilty Until Proven Innocent","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
