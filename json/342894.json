It is confusing and concerning to be told your baby \"has colic\" because it sounds like it is an illness or a condition that is abnormal. When the baby is given medication to treat symptoms of colic, it reinforces the idea that there is something wrong with the baby, when in fact, the baby is going through a very normal developmental phase. That is why we prefer to refer to this time as the Period of PURPLE Crying. This is not because the baby turns purple while crying. The acronym is a meaningful and memorable way to describe what parents and their babies are going through.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f4fzIMwNhLC693niYbubyx3Faog.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A New Way to Understand Your Baby's Crying","title":"The Period of Purple Crying","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
