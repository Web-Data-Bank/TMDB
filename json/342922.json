The film tells the stories of those who have been killed by gunfire, whether from accidental violence, random shootings, family disputes or suicide. Hear those stories of those who have died, which is only a fraction of the 32,000 people killed in America each year, 88 per day, from gun violence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vFGEu4toCQV1cl6tZEsHR21zOfc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7429,"logo_path":"/6in9uMqxXEHx5XgYgkeRBpZ4rPw.png","name":"HBO Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story Of Shattered Lives, And The People Left Behind.","title":"Requiem for the Dead: American Spring 2014","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":4}
