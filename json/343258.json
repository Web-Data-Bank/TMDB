This film tells the story of their difficult relationship, seen from the perspective of the younger brother, who is not afraid to dish up a good share of self-mockery. “My brother thinks that once in a lifetime, everyone should take apart an engine block,” we hear him say in the voiceover. Next, we see Wout grapple with a towel and a pile of engine parts, while his older brother irritably lectures him from a distance. When Wout scales the slopes of the Himalayas with his camera, he comes to the point of making an important decision about his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":54890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nederlandse Filmacademie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Turn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
