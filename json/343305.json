For years I thought I had made a film-poem, without knowing how to explain it, until Gilles Deleuze created the concept of \"perception-image\":  A character acts on the screen and it is assumed to see the world in a certain way. But simultaneously the camera sees him, and sees his world from another point of view which thinks, reflects, and transforms the viewpoint of the character [...]. In short, perception-image finds its status, as free indirect subjective, from the moment that it reflects its content in a camera-consiousness which has become autonomous ('cinema of poetry').  (Gilles Deleuze, Cinema I: The Movement-Image).","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/aXHj5J8poQL9R4SXtB19QZf6SsQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baltazar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
