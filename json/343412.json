She struggles to get by with this teenager who gets deeper and deeper in violence and juvenile delinquency. Speaking sentimentally, things are not going better: the relationship with her lover has come to an end. It may seems depressing, but Marie doesn’t give up, even if love seems to be an inaccessible dream. But love, there is.
