The construction vocational school holds a name-giving ceremony, thus calling the attention of its supervisory organ to itself. The school-master distributes as well as receives presents from the sponsoring factory, and the pupils sit for a written examination of unheard-of material. The results are devastating, which the despotic school-master attempts to conceal by a staged disciplinary procedure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5nbUEnQ1bwsMF66BaxhEy8lErfo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8100,"logo_path":"/1HuVRo0SYPSzYvduxVf4baaWqOI.png","name":"Mafilm","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1976-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spider Football","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
