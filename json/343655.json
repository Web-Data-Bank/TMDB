Equal parts found-footage mash-up, verit√© investigation, and artful meditation, the film charts the lives of both humans and non-humans who have experienced animal testing first-hand, with hauntingly honest testimony of scientists and lab technicians whose ethics demanded they choose a different path, as well as the simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking stories of animals who have seen both sides of the cage. MTD aims to re-ignite the debate about animal testing by bringing these rarely-heard perspectives to the fore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":55024,"logo_path":null,"name":"Decipher Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maximum Tolerated Dose","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":3}
