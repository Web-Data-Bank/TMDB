Perhaps the most familiar, H. A. Rey's Curious George Rides a Bike, is a freewheeling misadventure involving a new bicycle, paper boats, a circus, a trumpet-swallowing ostrich, and a runaway bear. Margaret Mahy's The Great White Man-Eating Shark is a playful story about Norvin, a boy whose shark-like features allow him to scare away unwanted swimmers. Patricia McKissack narrates her book Flossie and the Fox, in which a clever young African-American girl visits her neighbor with a basket of eggs and outfoxes a fox.  This DVD contains three bonus stories, Louise Fatio's The Happy Lion, Michael Foreman's The Cat and Canary, and a Spanish-language version of Curious George Rides a Bike.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curious George Rides a Bike ... and More Tales of Mischief","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
