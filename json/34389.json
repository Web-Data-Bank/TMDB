American director James Longley spent more than two years filming in Iraq to create this stunningly photographed, poetically rendered documentary of the war-torn country as seen through the eyes of Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds.","popularity":2.467,"poster_path":"/snVhUvp5Cq8Vaxr19sPl33eeYX0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Typecast Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":108286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daylight Factory","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-21","revenue":202000,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iraq in Fragments","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":16}
