The imagery in the film is dense, wearying and beautiful, but ultimately hard to decipher, for, in contrast to his earlier, and more famous film Chelsea Girls, made in 1966, Warhol directed that two reels be screened simultaneously on top of each other on a single screen, rather than side-by-side.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/unmpkU6kCPv70EYRcFyFe84rCtM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andy Warhol Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"★★★★","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
