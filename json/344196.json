It is a tense and cleverly off-kilter drama, well performed and astutely thought-provoking. It makes great use of its Yorkshire locations, creating a tense and memorably intriguing atmosphere.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/eHILoeiYSXCRwqU5Vqcvmc32WXV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Incident","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
