It is obvious from their reactions, particularly the cook (Leo White) that whatever was said did not go down too well.  His animated arms knock down the man standing behind him repeatedly until all three servants simultaneously quit.  They storm off into the adjoining kitchen where a slavery maid (Blanche White) is on the floor scrubbing the floor.  The men all trip over her, moan briefly and then leave.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/29s9rDF6BDnPqXJV9Ogy7niR1MY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91633,"logo_path":null,"name":"King Bee Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chief Cook","video":false,"vote_average":4.375,"vote_count":4}
