Kurt Moll is a wonderful Gurnemanz, but compared to his studio recording under Karajan a decade earlier it has lost some of its original velvety body and luster. As Parsifal, Jerusalem is starting to show some wear and tear on his voice at the Met in 1992 as opposed to his prime form at Bayreuth in 1981, but is still quite good; only Placido Domingo could compete with him in the role at that time.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/aCTWSZ1vZNd55axOTsTC8LF6M5t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":264,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Wagner: Parsifal","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
