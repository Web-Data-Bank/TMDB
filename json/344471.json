It's a delightful and enlightening interview. This is followed by Wieder-Atherton playing 6 short pieces of quite different styles, from the heartbreaking melodies of Schubert and Brahms to Berio's more edgy modern sounds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6BaXnQ06Ulub85NbBALOPfGdE1f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Sonia Wieder-Atherton","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
