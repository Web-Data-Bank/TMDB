The film chronicles the journey of (fictional) misguided market researcher John Wooley (played by Second City alum Brian Shortall) as he attempts to sell ISPs' vision for what they call a \"faster, cleaner\" Internet. However, learning about net neutrality from several (non-fictional) people in the process, he ultimately opts to re-consider his standpoint.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Internet Must Go","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
