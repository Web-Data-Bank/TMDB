In February 1942, inking, painting and technicolor photography were completed for \"Clair de Lune\" as a short subject, but it was not released. In 1946 it was edited , reshaped and re-scored as the popular music sequence \"Blue Bayou\" in \"Make Mine Music\".  Previous attempts to recreate \"Clair de Lune\" were frustrated by missing animation and Stokowski footage. A nitrate workprint of the original version located in 1992 has allowed \"Clair de Lune\" to be completely reconstructed as Walt Disney intended it to be seen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hPUk47JzJVPWpJPcDLY77sENVNb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clair de Lune","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
