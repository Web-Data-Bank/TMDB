It's 1946 and the war is still hanging in the air even if the small community doesn't seem to have been affected that much by it. Even so, certain suspicions take root in the brigadier's mind. The hotel in the town was the setting for unexplained deaths and crimes that had been covered up. Gatta decides to investigate. Fragments begin to emerge, killers and their victims take shape and speak to each other from different times. There's the hotel owner, a grief-striken mother, a weak son and long-suffering sister, an orphan and two woman who were violently killed. Pain, indifference and shame cast a shadow over everything.","popularity":1.371,"poster_path":"/bpOqKWOY85taBx4kZuaryWCymOA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poetiche Cinematografiche","origin_country":""},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2004-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Follow the Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
