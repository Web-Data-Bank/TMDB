Dimi has to spend the vacation with his older brother by the Baltic Sea. On a country road he meets beautiful Isabelle. He is fascinated by her, but disillusioned when they arrive at the campsite together: Isabelle is in a relationship, and her boyfriend is Dimis’ older brother Steffen. But Dimi doesn't give up and keeps on struggling for her attention. He shares an inflatable mattress with her, scares her in the shower and takes her on a boat trip.
