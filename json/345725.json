The hook here is Chen’s amazing performance as the simple, slightly crude Latioazi, a goat farmer who has a son in jail. When a young mentally handicapped man follows him home one day and enters his life, it sets off a blaze and a chain of events follows, which bares China’s class divide raw. His random act of reluctant kindness invites a parade of strangers and grifters all intent on draining Latioazi of what little he has.","popularity":1.027,"poster_path":"/rd2h8efnjfVyDuPmh1eIUcJcKaT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Fool","video":false,"vote_average":7.342,"vote_count":19}
