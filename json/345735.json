A twenty-something punk fancies himself a total player, but the best job he can find is overnight clerk at a convenience store. The other clerk is a cute chick and you’re thinking “rom com,” but then there’s a robbery, a gangster, a shoot-out, and by the time a neighbor is pulling out a homemade bomb, you realize that this violent farce is all about the current situation in Hong Kong where nothing makes sense, the heartless wipe their feet on the hopeless, and you might as well burn it all down because there are no more better tomorrows.","popularity":4.455,"poster_path":"/nTm9bsrMr17Y5PonoGbAnGoirXW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sun Entertainment Culture","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2016-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robbery","video":false,"vote_average":6.985,"vote_count":34}
