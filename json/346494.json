He lives in the sticks with his mother, a non-stop nagger, in Faintville, a Canadian timber industry town. He has no father, no friends, not even a favorite meal. Basically, his sole wish is simply to vanish from the face of the earth. One day, Mike writes his own obituary and shoots himself. To his great disappointment he wakes up the in the local hospital. During a routine examination, the doctors discover a plum-sized tumor in his brain. Mike can scarcely believe his luck and keeps the illness to himself to avoid undergoing surgery that would save him. Staring death directly in the eyes, however, changes Mike's point of view and he re-evaluates his opinion of both enchanting and crazy Miranda. Somebody seems to understand him after all.","popularity":4.502,"poster_path":"/tXD87AbZz1R12gH5wyndAXaD6Vb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Six Island Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":24307,"logo_path":"/xJo66MG6C99FeO81ddXVswjEmSB.png","name":"UFA Fiction","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":9291,"logo_path":"/g6GYZXQrjB86Z5ocVliUZF1i3Tz.png","name":"HR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of Mike Tyson... not the boxer.","title":"Coconut Hero","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":56}
