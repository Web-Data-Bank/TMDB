Joe emotionally blackmails Luke to guide them there, hoping to escape on the way. The usual route must shortened from 6 to 2 months, so no danger can be avoided. Given Lucky's reputation, Crook decides to shadow them to add sabotage, just to be sure- or is it?","popularity":4.778,"poster_path":"/bP5i9zLWzMz2DJ9msmqB27w3GDP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17065,"logo_path":"/mqoS56YswPVBO3nriH2Qj6pWWbY.png","name":"Studio Xilam","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dargaud Marina","origin_country":""},{"id":7981,"logo_path":"/6Yv1gIAuGkHS5Vis4UjnqHhCPWV.png","name":"Pathé","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":856,"logo_path":"/z0vTTWBhZggM09oZWSY3hbXgPKv.png","name":"Wild Bunch","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Go West: A Lucky Luke Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":6.156,"vote_count":90}
