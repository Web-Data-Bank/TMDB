Based on the model of a natural woodland, a forest garden incorporates a wide variety of useful plants, including fruit and nut trees, perennial herbs, and vegetables. Robert Hart blends history, philosophy, anthropology, and seasonal gardening wisdom, which together comprise a remarkable testament to the pleasures of \"hands-off\" as well as hands-on gardening.  Practical features include:  Design guidelines for creating your own perennial food-producing garden\r Lists of recommended plants and varieties,\r An explanation of how plants in different levels or \"stories\" --from ground covers to full-sized trees--coexist and interact in a healthy and productive landscape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":65254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iota Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest Gardening with Robert Hart","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
