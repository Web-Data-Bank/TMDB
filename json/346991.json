The space is a camera obscura in which the cameraman's movements convert a line of light into multidirectional rays. Toward the end there are up to eight unique superimpositions and single frames. The music was added in 1989, with an anaogue synthesizer and digital delay.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ventana","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
