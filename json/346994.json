I found a film already conceived in the 1914 design; it was enough to follow the trajectories traced by Gaudi, imagine them as a labyrinth, reproduce the bursting of the mosaics through an analogous fracture of linear temporality. In the editing I tried to avoid showing passers-by. No human figure should get in the way of the appearance of that fantastic architecture. The stop-motion technique applied to the position and parameters of the camera still seems suitable for representing the undulating space of the park.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eNi7Z32xAZzcZO6CR8WFnLaxQQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film Gaud√≠","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
