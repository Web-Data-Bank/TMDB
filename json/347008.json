Stringing together the most common tropes and scenes of slashers, zombie flicks, slumber party massacres, etc. into a single meta-horror opus, Rivers not so much deconstructs the genre as provides a tribute that reveals its limitations but also its visceral power.  It’s films like this that explain why I do film programs like ‘Experiments in Terror’” – Noel Lawrence, Provocateur Pictures.","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terror","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
