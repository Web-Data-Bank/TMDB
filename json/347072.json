True feelings can change people and make them grow up. And love is a magical and pure feeling that can awaken courage in hearts.","popularity":0.934,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":56989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victoriya","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2013-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Mermaid, My Lorelei","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
