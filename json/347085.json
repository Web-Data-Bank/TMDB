Technically and conceptually astonishing in their own right, these films are also as remarkable for their philosophical consistency as for their frequently mind-boggling imagery. This package also includes a bonus short, Johanes Doktor Faust (1958), the longer cut of 'The Cabinet of Jan Švankmajer' with a new introduction by the Quay Brothers, the documentary Les Chimeres des Švankmajer (2001), interviews with Jan and Eva Švankmajer and examples of their work in other media. There's also a chance to see some Švankmajer special effects, created when he was banned from directing his own films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Khe9H6YuhnZZfu1sNDP3puL9nw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":313,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jan Švankmajer: The Complete Short Films","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
