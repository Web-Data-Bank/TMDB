But in the meantime here's Volume 2. Volume two of the Jackass series contains a random, haggard selection of segments and bits that aired on our crappy little television show. Remarkable moments in this half-ass collection include Chris Pontius masquerading as an American werewolf and creating panic in the streets of London, Johnny Knoxville sticking his arm right up a cow's butt, Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo taking the hockey gloves off and brawling in the middle of a caf√©, Ehren McGhehey falling flat on his pink face while skateboarding blindfolded, and a bunch of other absurd stunts, pranks and queer misbehavior from our bumbling cat and crew of idiots.","popularity":3.429,"poster_path":"/ecWKuDYMK5qMVylooX3cBw4uJeG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dickhouse Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jackass Volume Two","video":true,"vote_average":7.214,"vote_count":42}
