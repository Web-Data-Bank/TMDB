Aguirre that was in production from 1979 to 1982, being released in theaters in Mexico City in 1983. However, the end result was apparently of really poor quality, so much that the movie was pulled from theaters only two days after its premiere. The movie was never broadcast on TV nor released on home video, and information about it or its creators is almost nonexistent. The only surviving visual information is a promotional poster containing both original art and a black and white still from the movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g1ZBPiHhiJebN7pJ8HTADIo4In6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aguirre Valdez Productores y Distribuidores","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1983-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roy del espacio","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
