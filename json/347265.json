Dalisay struggles to journey from the Philippine countryside to New York City to marry Dean, a disillusioned ex-merchant marine. She's hoping to buy a cure for her dying sister and, ultimately, a future for her debt-ridden family, while he hopes to escape his disintegrating American family through love and a family of his own. A powerful, controversial film that quietly builds to a shattering collision of aspirations and cultures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fTkMPJR8b1rroUq8F3mfuN1Vn57.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elibon Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"At What Price Family?","title":"Closer to Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
