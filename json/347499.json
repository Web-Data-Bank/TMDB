Questions that have been asked since our early existence. However, throughout history we have apparently never recognized the many signs we encountered on our path, and which could have provided answers. Why?  The answer is... we ourselves are the problem! We limit ourselves by our limited way of thinking. And if we than do discover certain directives, we start to distort these so that practically nothing of these remain. It is also the reason why prophets and great oracles, when they revealed their knowledge and wisdom, were misinterpreted by our own limited way of thinking. Yet... answers and explanations are closer than we would surmise. The only thing we have to do is expand our way of thinking, after which we come to the conclusion that our universe and our consciousness consist of many layers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i1RuqA2R2JkfLMPkd9ILPbGyIQg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Find the Book of Knowledge","title":"Staya erusa","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
