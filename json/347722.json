The privileging of local produce over imported goods is ever present regardless of whether or not the groceries actually are better, this follows to lines of argument â€“ that by buying Croatian produce they are supporting Croatian agriculture and that domestic produce is familiar and tastier, although it is not the origin of the goods but the method of its production that counts.
