In Daylight Moon, he reaches even further back, to try to recall the moments in which a small child configures the world out of patterns of visual fascination, a mode of seeing that relies on touch and the feel of things rather than deep space. One of his most abstract films, Daylight Moon rarely reveals a human figure. Instead of characters, Klahr gives us the play of enigmatic spaces and empty sites that promise both the invitation of desire and the discovery of crime\" Tom Gunning","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AtF8tUxHypN5SInKxKvHbT6D0xU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daylight Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
