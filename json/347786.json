They moved to Moscow many years ago and have become successful. Olga is an actress, Katya works for a large-scale PR agency, and Andrey is a political analyst. They buy cars, take mortgages, build country houses. Just like everybody else. But their lives bring them neither happiness nor content. The feeling of \"something's not right but I can't put my finger on it\" underpins the lives of today's thirty-year-olds. Their childhood took place during the Soviet era, when kids dreamed of becoming heroes, believed in spy stories and a bright future. Yet nobody expected that the dream of becoming a hero would be replaced by the dream of stable and predictable existence. People have stopped dreaming of truly grand things. They just play their roles.","popularity":1.025,"poster_path":"/kItaVNUJwAN6yPrzqKgs4QJA3Hs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":318,"logo_path":"/q0UG4oZERwIywJdDPF4lRlvdYGW.png","name":"CTB Film Company","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":57510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Masterskaya Seance","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2015-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pioneer Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
