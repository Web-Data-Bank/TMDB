Over the next 40 years, they build a self-governed community with the hope of becoming legitimate.\r Finding it politically unpopular to evict the settlers, the Danish government declared Christiania a \"short-term social experiment\". Following 40 years of tense relations with the government, much of it focusing on the open hashish trade, Christiania is on its way to becoming a legitimate community.\r Christiania was born in 1971 when youthful idealism and a severe housing shortage incited hundreds of young people to occupy 85 acres of deserted brick buildings, woods, ramparts and canals as their home.","popularity":1.095,"poster_path":"/gBJ6Qgxr8op4S0bUdmEOW0E99pB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"40 Years of Occupation","title":"Christiania: 40 Years of Occupation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
