The storyline is a scaffolding on which Rudy Ray Moore's standup humor can be unfolded. Beginning life as the afterbirth to a watermelon, the young Wheatstraw becomes a martial artist, but is unable to best the evil comedy team of Leroy and Skillet, who also indulge in wholesale murder. Satan restores the comedians' victims to life, and charges Petey with the task of marrying his clock-stoppingly ugly daughter to give him a grandchild. When Petey attempts to default on the deal, he is pursued by the devil's henchmen.","popularity":3.112,"poster_path":"/bQFFMMMupaCAdWcgnBjVVlbK5wq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comedian Intl Enterprise Productions (C.I.E.)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Have No Fear, It's the Comedy Smash of the Year!","title":"Petey Wheatstraw","video":false,"vote_average":5.296,"vote_count":27}
