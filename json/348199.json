Costa finds, just in time to save stealing uniformed cop Manolo's kids, that this was a collateral killing, because he was in the way for another murder by poisoned dessert at Arrabal's wedding to gold-digger Carmen. Arrabal leans on his fiend the police chief to close the case, but Costa rightly suspects more crimes and digs on for possible motives concerning restaurant rating blackmail, infidelity and old grudges.
