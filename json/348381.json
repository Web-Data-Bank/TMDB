From national icons like Gardel, Evita, Che, and Maradona the film dialogs with recent Argentine history and it does so with extraordinary energy, supported by a rarely seen use of all kinds of archive material in an almost Dionysian state of sampleadelia. The film arrives to a surprising reflection on nationalism, demagogic governments and delusions of unanimity; problems that are common to emerging societies that cannot find their ways to a freer and more egalitarian society.","popularity":1.374,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olympus vacuum","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
