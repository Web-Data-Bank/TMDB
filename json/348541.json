After living in New York for a year, Beth returns on New Year's Eve a changed girl, willing to mend her ways and grow up. Milena and Carina, however, are not happy about their friend's change - Keen on stopping Beth form becoming \"respectable\" at all costs, they show up at her house with dozens of friends to celebrate the New Year. Before dawn, secrets will be revealed, friendships will be tested, hearts will broken, and tears (and other bodily fluids) will be spilled. As the night unfolds, we also witness past events in a seedy nightclub, which changed the lives of those three girls forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/25bGubPrf6vrYyLjifrlhXbymP2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53105,"logo_path":"/rn9sEaA8cXurMyd8HnWkhv8KLqi.png","name":"Paris Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":17680,"logo_path":"/7RtrfAVWgne5MRgXl8O3oD6Ncom.png","name":"Accorde Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":7764,"logo_path":"/6YQPMXHq7juxomK9Sy3zBqbalsD.png","name":"Telecine","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":181196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aramefarpado","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2015-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"#Thosegirls","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":3}
