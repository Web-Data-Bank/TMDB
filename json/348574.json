Jump ahead ten years: the dad is dead, the mom is gone, and the son, Luke, is raising his now grown sister, Annie. He's overprotective, and she seems blood simple, a coquette and an innocent. He runs the diner in town, and one day, Lisa, a callow writer-to-be, comes through from Manhattan, keeping a journal, looking for interesting people. She takes a shine to Annie and then to the muscular and well-read Luke. But what is their secret, how many of the townsfolk are in on it, and what will Lisa do when it all becomes clear?","popularity":0.926,"poster_path":"/7RxFvdeTEIYW1cvVaIzJp1KnjW5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58073,"logo_path":null,"name":"JLM Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annie's Garden","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
