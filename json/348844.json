Knowing nothing about plumbing, they answer Mr. Skunkem's ad for plumber's assistants, and are sent to the Dinwitty estate to recover a diamond ring from a drain pipe. In due course they destroy the bathroom, and switch the gas and water lines, disrupting Mrs. Dinwitty's bridge party, Vanillia's dinner preparation, and the gardener's lawn watering.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9lTsTG17f3Yn96ghjoCIi0Ew1Fk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pick a Peck of Plumbers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
