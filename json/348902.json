Never seen in her lifetime, they were found by chance in a Chicago storage locker and auctioned off cheaply.  Now Vivian Maier has gone viral and her magical pictures sell for thousands of dollars. Vivian was a tough street photographer, a secret poet of suburbia. In life she was a recluse, a hoarder, spinning tall tales about her French roots. Presented by Alan Yentob, the film includes stories from those who knew her and those who revealed her astonishing work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e8QtjA5tL9U7kSY0ZwTTVsFZuw5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivian Maier: Who Took Nanny's Pictures?","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
