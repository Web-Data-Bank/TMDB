Before the concert songs kick in, this set begins with a studio recording of a previously unreleased song, \"Aime\", exclusive to this album.

Some had to be entirely reworked to fit the concept of this live show. In addition, Fabian delivers a tribute to her idol Barbra Streisand by performing \"Papa Can You Hear Me\" and \"A Piece of Sky\", both from the soundtrack of Streisand's film tour de force \"Yentl\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mdH56BV0yS8GfxrT53GOeAZWLHj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polydor Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":139875,"logo_path":null,"name":"9 Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":13245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elf Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un Regard 9 Live","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
