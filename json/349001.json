The group originated in the late 1950s via the innovative efforts of Jacques Loussier, founder of the Play Bach Trio, then reformed some thirty-five years later (c. 1985) with Loussier, bassist Vincent Charbonnier and percussionist Andr√© Arpino, and an emphasis on stringing together an entirely new repertoire. This concert release presents an extended set by the second incarnation of the group. Selections include: Pastorale in C minor, Gavotte in B Minor, Fugue No. 5 in D Major, and Gavotte in D Major.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4hmxU81NKUA6ocWilPZBnL53P8a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124843,"logo_path":"/aX6ufVP7tTY5XNLygICUEPxw6UV.png","name":"Productions Loft","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jacques Loussier Trio - Play Bach - The 1989 Munich Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
