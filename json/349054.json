Director Nicole Ma spent more than a decade documenting Putuparri's journey, travelling with him and his family on numerous occasions to Kurtal, in the Kimberley's Great Sandy Desert region – traditionally a site of great significance as a place where people ritually make rain – as they fight for their native title claim over the area.  Set against the backdrop of this long fight for ownership of traditional lands, the MIFF Premiere Fund-supported Putuparri and the Rainmakers is an emotional, visually breathtaking story of love, hope and the survival of Aboriginal law and culture against all odds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eITuVbORQ65V7XQSxOxNXBOlzh8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105801,"logo_path":"/3rh9RoodRlCw3urr21LG0gYZvSs.png","name":"MIFF Premiere Fund","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Putuparri and the Rainmakers","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
