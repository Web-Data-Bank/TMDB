A former militant woman who now devotes her time to feminine soccer; a young woman who is active so no girl has to go through what she went through and a lesbian mother who recounts how hostile the laws are regarding the rights of lesbian women. In spite of the difficulties their characters go through, the stories have a lot of humour, some soccer and a tour of the city.","popularity":0.771,"poster_path":"/383QCahyBgLJy0sVc58dbwDfLoZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lesbians of Buenos Aires","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":4}
