Then the rain started... No matter what people tried, nothing could stop the water. Soon, disease spread, robbing people's abilities to speak; the endless rain killing all other forms of communication with its acidic torrent. This was a time when dialogue became a new challenge. When everything we knew had to be reinvented. This was also a time, in the midst of a chaotic, decaying environment, when a man tried to cope with the loss of his former lover.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tyjKPBQPngXH1cDzRGu8eYWW0xI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screen Machine/La Machine Écran","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2002-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The City Without Windows","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
