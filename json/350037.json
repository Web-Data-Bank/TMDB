The shepherd children own the mountains and, although no adults are around, they know the rules; they know that boys and girls are not allowed to be together. The boys practice with their slings to fight wolves. The girls smoke secretly and play at getting married, dreaming of finding a husband soon. They gossip about Sediqa; she’s eleven years old and an outsider. The girls think she is cursed. Qodrat, also eleven years old, becomes the subject of gossip when his mother remarries an old man with two wives. Qodrat roams alone in the most isolated parts of the mountains, where he meets Sediqa and they become friends.","popularity":0.667,"poster_path":"/AgfyY4UGEmVGPeqrGHOb3goMgHv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64935,"logo_path":"/8Ra3mFEHfEDh89PQGWoJHE9lSkr.png","name":"Adomeit Film","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":78021,"logo_path":null,"name":"LA FABRICA NOCTURNA PRODUCTIONS","origin_country":""},{"id":12219,"logo_path":"/cU5xtXF1NbOEdtwQNJTGC1IlHBS.png","name":"Cinereach","origin_country":"US"},{"id":77292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinéfondation","origin_country":""},{"id":135828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danish Arts Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":118,"logo_path":"/AiBorgNTCS1lT1FdFPYheax9jfF.png","name":"Det Danske Filminstitut","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i Väst","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":135829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmwerkstatt Kiel","origin_country":""},{"id":135830,"logo_path":null,"name":"French Embassy in Afghanistan","origin_country":""},{"id":10875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hong Kong Asia Film Financing Forum","origin_country":""},{"id":135831,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institut Français d'Afghanistan","origin_country":""},{"id":2588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministère des Affaires Étrangères","origin_country":""},{"id":25220,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Danish Screen","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":135832,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schleswig-Holstein Film Commission","origin_country":""},{"id":47437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robber's Dog Films","origin_country":"NZ"},{"id":46983,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Swiss Agency for Development \u0026 Cooperation","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":12381,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visions Sud Est","origin_country":""},{"id":135834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wolf Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":24488,"logo_path":"/qR7gDm9nMYdrqnVpksmNMhwI1ZI.png","name":"Women Make Movies","origin_country":"US"},{"id":135835,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wouter Barendrecht Film Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":8288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zentropa International Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":100886,"logo_path":"/4WZMpUq2FoiRbcHGcfjN8ZklYZr.png","name":"MEDIA sub-programme of Creative Europe","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolf and Sheep","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":10}
