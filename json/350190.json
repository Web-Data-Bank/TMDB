Dong-gi, Ho-tae, and Jae-ha go to Chairman Kim of an electronics company to get the funds to make it. They experiment the 'snooze machine' on their younger brother, Dong-seok. Once at the bottom of the class, Dong-seok goes to the top but he is ostracized by his classmates. They reject the snooze machine and shout, 'Let us live like human beings!' Ho-tae gets into an argument with the other two over the development of the snooze machine. He moves out but later is persuaded back by the great burst of laughter stemming from solid friendship. Arm in arm, the three face a brighter tomorrow together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g0Ds6AwmgZBOxHI1QApn3rMEroV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1989-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Love, Don Quixote","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
