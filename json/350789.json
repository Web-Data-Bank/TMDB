That's the question Jason Reynolds and his classmates are assigned as a topic for speech class. But when Jason watches his best friend fight a life and death battle with leukemia, the question becomes far more than an academic endeavor. This powerful video dramatically presents the good news of the gospel in the context of the love that sent Christ to the cross. As Jason comes to grips with the realities of life and the consequences of sin, viewers are challenged to answer for themselves the question of life's ultimate priority. An excellent program for outreach events, for evangelistic invitations in your youth group or in homes, or to inspire believers to share their faith.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/8ETQKgqFeVoynHFmKhs5jdu8XGU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crossing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
