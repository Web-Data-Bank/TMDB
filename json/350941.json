The Goddess Of Mercy is a good example of her strong empathy and noble presence. The youngest daughter of a brutal king, the princess openly disapproves of the floggings and cruel treatment her royal family heaps on the peasants. As a result, the heartless king turns on his own daughter forcing her into exile. This humanistic tale will inspire and hearten even the most cynical viewer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/exheMlvcfzvwwaB3NLujWLbrTRo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":43979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shin Films","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1967-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Goddess of Mercy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
