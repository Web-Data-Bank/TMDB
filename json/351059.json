Also known as \"jump training,\" this technique emerged in Eastern Europe in the early 1970s.  Coined by American track coach Fred Will, the term derives from the Latin plyo+metrics, or \"measurable increases.\"  Plyometrics training relates to any activity that requires speed and strength, as it improves your ability to run faster, jump higher, and maneuver in multidirectional sports.
