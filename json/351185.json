Their mission was a fast daylight raid to kidnap lead terrorist Mohammed Farrah Aidid, who had been killing U.N. workers delivering food to starving Somalis. Aididâ€™s goal was to control the country by controlling all the food.  The mission abruptly changed to a rescue operation. Surrounded by Somali militia, a fierce firefight ensued that left American troops trapped and fighting for their lives. The ordeal left 18 American men dead, 70 wounded, with 3,000 Somalis casualties.  This brilliant documentary tells the true story of \"Black Hawk Down\" through the memories and voices of the American Special Forces survivors. Also included are Somali militiamen as they recount their harrowing experiences of battle.","popularity":1.759,"poster_path":"/d1vCGfo7wzwA0ubxsuJET1ubGzg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48042,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Eyes Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":24026,"logo_path":"/gOevBiBuzH8Oy4E3FnjBoIm30G9.png","name":"44 Blue Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"},{"id":18441,"logo_path":"/rJmXT9sgCKG8uSUO1T93kOTfAzm.png","name":"A+E Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The True Story of Black Hawk Down","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":8}
