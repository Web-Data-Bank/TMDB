As Brookshire writes, \"The subject of the work is duration, and color is the medium through which we experience it. The converse is also true: the subject is color and duration is the medium. The effect is a direct experience of time and vision.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color Series","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
