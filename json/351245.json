Typically referred to as the 'budget' or 'budget report', a one-year presentation document; the discussion is framed to avoid any reference to the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the CAFR, the same local Government's Statement of Net Worth that shows the wealth that has built up over decades. This is the biggest shell game played in government finance. Selectively created budget reports are presented to the population and the CAFR is never mentioned, hiding the true wealth held by local cities, counties, states, universities, and enterprise operations.
