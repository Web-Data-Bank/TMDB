What mysteries are hidden in his roots, gnarled over time? Does he remember the serpent and the lost Paradise? Our body remembers more than we can expect and imagine. It remembers the sorrow and pain of our predecessors. It keeps alive the stories of our parents and grandparents as well as their ancestors. But how far back is it possible to go in your bodily memory? The stop-motion animation BODY MEMORY takes as its central concept the idea that our body remembers, not only individual experiences, but also the sorrow and pain of our predecessors. A powerful visualization of subconscious processes and the hidden horror of deportation. Inspired by historical events: the Soviet deportations from Estonia in the 1940s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9XpLP2kHSDnCL15Ls702sbh3S8H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69851,"logo_path":"/eRkN7XGL7KmMYe8vUmtTuM4oSLP.png","name":"Nukufilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2011-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body Memory","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
