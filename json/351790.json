Punk morale was higher than ever before. Punks were fused together not by fear, but by a surging spirit of revenge, immortality, and the courage never to submit or yield. This proved that punk won't go away and that punks themselves are becoming younger and nastier everyday. They have no time for the precarious thrills of nostalgia nor for its trivial rules.","popularity":0.71,"poster_path":"/tyUXK5IxUzmovBPZ7a2WsMUGuaD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kendon Films Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":3147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyd's Company","origin_country":""},{"id":70465,"logo_path":null,"name":"GTO","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1979-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Punk Can Take It","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
