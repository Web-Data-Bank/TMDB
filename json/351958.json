In a beautiful collision of minds and media, Project Re: Brief is a grand experiment whereby Google partnered with five of the brightest “old-school” legends from advertising to re-imagine their most iconic creative work from a half-century ago for the modern web. Directed by Doug Pray, and the same team who joined him to make the Emmy-Award-winning film and PBS hit “Art &amp; Copy,” Project Re: Brief is a film that aims to shake up the ad industry and inspire new ways of thinking. While shifting formats and media platforms is one thing, as we learn from our heroes of the past, the basic tenets of human storytelling haven’t changed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Film About Re-imagining Advertising","title":"Project Re: Brief","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
