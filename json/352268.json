Often referred to as “a typical Aussie bloke”, Dave Hughes is actually an unusual success story. From working class roots, the university drop-out and former abattoir worker has risen to become one of Australia’s most popular and successful stand-up comedians. His honesty and laconic humour have led to several long-term hosting roles on television and radio, most recently on The Project and Nova 100. However in 2014, Hughesy has returned to his first love – stand-up comedy – and is the hottest comedy act touring nationally and internationally.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5S77BbANydbVORyMwe81NGun56U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pointless is Dave Hughes 2014 Comedy Show.","title":"Dave Hughes - Pointless","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
