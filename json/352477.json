Adults don’t usually believe in talking dogs, but Max is certain that the tip from the would-be assassin’s pet dog is a sure thing. As he and his human and animal friends set out to put a stop to the sinister plan, his parents, the police, and even his bodyguard discredit his suspicion. When Agent Clyde finally begins to catch on, time is running out, and they must act quickly to save the president’s life. The story reminds us that doing the right thing isn’t always easy, and heroes come in all sizes.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/93rwwqWD3OsL5eM86igzOYdtabT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Undercover Kid","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
