Back then, the only way for a film to be seen was on television or in the theater. Donald threatened to sue any broadcaster or distributor that took on the film. In effect, it was suppressed. It was screened twice in back-to-back standing room only showings at the Bridgehampton Community House on July 3, 1991, the same day that Donald announced his engagement to Marla Maples.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/yGp7a0GGFBS6qTRhZhpF9MzNSYG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59828,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Deadline Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"New Trump, Old Trump, Same Trump","title":"Trump: What's The Deal?","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
