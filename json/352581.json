San Francisco Opera's co-production features two of the greatest voices in bel canto together for the first time: mezzo Joyce DiDonato and soprano Nicole Cabell. Their compelling duet is one of the finest marriages between two voices in many, many years. The production, directed by Vincent Broussard and featuring costumes by Christian Lecroix, is captured in brilliant HD.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y0tC6e6i1mVHFp0d8SND0yi2ytY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20863,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Capuleti e i Montecchi","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
