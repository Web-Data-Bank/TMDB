The rear-view mirrors reflect the faces of the people in the front very well. The instructor is never complimentary to his pupils and always makes the same nasty jokes. The camera keeps close to the dour man. But when at the end of the day he knocks down a boy, his frame of mind is turned topsy-turvy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corona Pictures B.V.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ten to Two","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
