The sounds and glances produced by the leading character, the cow Anna II, are telling enough. Her mooing and smacking minutely convey her displeasure with her farmer's budding conjugal bliss. When, on the morning after the wedding night, he enters the cowshed but does not pay enough attention to his prize cow yet, Anna II has had it. The cow's sultry gaze registers how the bride brings the farmer a cup of coffee.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hqvn15fxzEf0kyJKtfN4DGnB1LO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59909,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmprodukties de Luwte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anna II","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
