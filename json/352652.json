The man immediately moves in. The only thing he brings with him - hidden under a cloth - is a large cage. Acting against the man's express warning, the couple goes up to his room when he is away. Their curiosity costs both them and the tenant dearly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ventus Film","origin_country":""},{"id":12023,"logo_path":"/97tVKGqnkjn0hwTGGRDPRgYWbrE.png","name":"Nederlandse Programma Stichting (NPS)","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Geluk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
