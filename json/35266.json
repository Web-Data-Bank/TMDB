It is a film which highlights values like freedom, fun, friendship, and unity, rather than the riders' technical skills, all in a magnificent scenery where Mother Nature has the leading role. A cinematic feeling has been produced with the introduction of an unusually unique soundtrack, producing a perfect symbiosis between the original filming sounds and the music. While acting as editors, riders, cameramen, sherpa porters, and so on, six Italian friends have conceived, planned, and created a real-life film which remains closer to the everyday rider and his lifestyle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magmatic Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clorophilla","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
