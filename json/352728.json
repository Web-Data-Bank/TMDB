It's a quirky comedy about missing persons, \"accepting the bizaare and discovering the nature of the people close to you during stressful moments.\" \"Siklo,\" on the other hand, is an inspiring tale of optimism. It tackles domestic violence, with the victim joining a support group whose leader the victim becomes close to, sharing her heartaches and desires with her. A striking twist will make the victim realize that her life need not end in despair, knowing that after each love lost, life goes on. \"Kulam,\" is a mystic and intriguing story about love and black magic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8237,"logo_path":"/8GxGenlMmEDS1Z6vmZA5PDqA3p6.png","name":"GMA Pictures","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":59953,"logo_path":null,"name":"GMA Artist Center","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2006-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puso 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
