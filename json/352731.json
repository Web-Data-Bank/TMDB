Mark Cousins's bold documentary looks at death in the atomic age, but life too. Using only archive film and a new musical score by the band Mogwai, the film shows us an impressionistic kaleidoscope of our nuclear times - protest marches, Cold War sabre-rattling, Chernobyl and Fukishima - but also the sublime beauty of the atomic world, and how x-rays and MRI scans have improved human lives. The nuclear age has been a nightmare, but dreamlike too.","popularity":0.645,"poster_path":"/bzXe1Dm9ej7VqkGWqwr59BTNSfi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atomic: Living in Dread and Promise","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":10}
