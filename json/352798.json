Lives are kept to themselves; problems are not shared; questions are not entertained. The people living inside it have become used to leaving everything unstirred especially Margaret, the mother of the home. Margaret's desire for cleanliness and order alienates her from her family. She cannot confront the problems of her life and so she confronts dirty dishes, ugly stains, and disorderly appliances. To get to know her family, she snoops around - entering rooms, opening cabinets, reading journals she is not supposed to read. But everything changes when a journal entry of her daughter's makes her unravel, stirring the unstirred life that she has held on to for years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":57619,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Commission for Culture and the Arts","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":15808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemalaya Foundation","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2006-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mudraks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
