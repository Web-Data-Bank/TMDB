Experienced Claus Eriksen sits behind the fly rod and demonstrates materials, tools and tying techniques. He ties 15 good flies that contain all the most important tying techniques. Salmon flies, streamers, coastal flies, nymphs, wet and dry flies. There is a pattern description of all the flies. A total of over 2.5 hours of intensive fly tying film. Use the film at the same time as you tie the flies - you will discover how easy it is! The film is built around the book \"Gott i gang - Fly Tying\", and shows the same flies and techniques as in the book. The film is therefore a very good supplement to the book.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alt om Fluebinding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
