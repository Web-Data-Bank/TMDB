The anonymous, humble, painstaking everyday care required by a structure such as the Cathedral, over the years and still today, reveals the magnificence of human action that spans time and generations, holding within itself a grand humanist sentiment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":117903,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montmorency Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Never Ending Factory of the Duomo","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":5}
