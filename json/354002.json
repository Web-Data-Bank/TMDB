But ice-climber Will Gadd knows that the technically challenging mixed route on the rear wall of the 141-metre waterfall can only be mastered at sub-zero temperatures, because that’s when the loose rock is literally frozen up by the spray. However, what works for the route doesn’t necessarily help the athlete. The centimetre-thick layer of ice which Will has to remove from his safety rope at regular intervals doesn’t really make it easier for him to warm up to the route.","popularity":0.844,"poster_path":"/bjDbAv0aUADcz4ryJ2agS4MGTfQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Frozen Titans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
