All are caught in their own isolation and are fearful of the menace that has to be met. The film, as a personal interpretation of Beauty and the Beast, enciphers concerns, beliefs and desires in seductive images that are themselves a form of camouflage, making it possible to utter harsh truths.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A6saSL3k8z65eDoTKOiSyQTGfbM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sun and the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
