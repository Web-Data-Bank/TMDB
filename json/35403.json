It was a sad day for Swiss history when the airline's fleet was grounded on 2 October 2001. \"Grounding\" is set during the last days of the doomed airline, and tells the story of manager Mario A. Corti's unhappy fate, the last, unlucky CEO at the traditional airline company, as well as of all those nameless people who lost almost everything in the maelstrom of Swissair's downfall: their job, home and their belief in Switzerland.","popularity":0.923,"poster_path":"/rmRkwXxqXUSFUVMlPr6uc78Evir.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6663,"logo_path":"/gVL9spqQwwCQPly6moVVWuofouy.png","name":"C-Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2006-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grounding: The Last Days of Swissair","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":8}
