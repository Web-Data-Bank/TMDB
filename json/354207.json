He is face to face with the viewer, his head close against the video screen, lying cozily on the floor. Acconci writes, \"The scene is a living room — quiet, private night — the scene for a come-on — I can bring my legs around, wrapping myself around the viewer — I'm playing songs on a tape recorder — I follow the songs up, I'm building a relationship, I'm carrying it through.\" Smoking cigarettes, he begins a seductive monologue as he plays \"theme songs\" by the Doors, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Kris Kristofferson and others on a tape recorder. The songs are a starting point for his come-ons; the tenor of his monologues shifts with the lyrics. \"Of course I can't see your face. I have no idea what your face looks like. You could be anybody out there, but there's gotta be somebody watching me.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theme Song","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
