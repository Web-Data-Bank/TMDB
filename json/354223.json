Like Bruce, the hero has even given his ma a promise not to fight! But that vow is forgotten when a quaint coastal Taiwanese town is terrorized by Japanese sadist and their insidious collaborators. Then our temple-trained champion uses his Shaolin long-armed style to break bones and take names...not necessarily in that order. Many a samurai sword swinging killer with Hitler mustaches are dispatched under his fingers and feet of fury but when he must face a tiger clawing traitor for the soul of the village and heart of the girl he loves all bets are off.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/cRzUCVSUKNG2uSfRLflYUfUcyUr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaolin Long Arm","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
