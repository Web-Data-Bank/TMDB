Held for decades in a psychiatric institute, Quick's confessions emerged after years working with a group of touchy feely therapists, convinced that the recovery of memories would cure patients of their criminality. In a country with a low crime rate, the nation watched with horror as Quick's confessions mounted, accounting for many of the country's unsolved murders. With testimonials from a range of people whose lives have been dominated by this story - including Quick himself - and dramatic reenactment, Brian Hill weaves a stylish noir thriller that works a treat on the big screen. What appears at first to be a tale of unimaginable evil evolves into something much more layered as Hill digs deep into the motivations behind those working closely with Quick.","popularity":0.88,"poster_path":"/5BMTaKhJbOuIs61mtaQlEuOCoUm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4284,"logo_path":null,"name":"Century Films","origin_country":""},{"id":11486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Picturehouse Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/e8EXNSfwr5E9d3TR8dHKbQnQK4W.png","name":"Film4 Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i VÃ¤st","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Confessions of Thomas Quick","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":15}
