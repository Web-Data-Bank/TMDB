SLEEPY HAVEN materializes fantasies of an erotic daydream; the film is a cocktail that merges M端ller's own shots and found footage like a love act. Nude bodies of sailors are flaring up in flickering solarization effects; they are given an ardent aura of physical desire by this tattooing of the film emulsion. M端ller only gradually changes his material metaphors to metaphors of love. But it is not only FIREWORKS the film is alluding to; there is yet another classic shimmering through M端ller's imagery: Jean Genet's Un Chant d'Amour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6XwCfNMZJFJNnSxbQvujZgQAqor.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleepy Haven","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
