Starting in 1994, my personal web site Justin's Links from the Underground has documented family secrets, romantic relationships, and my experiments with sex and drugs.  overshare: the links.net story is a documentary about fumbling to foster intimacy between strangers online. Through interviews, analysis and graphic animations, I share my motivations, my joys and my sorrows from pioneering personal sharing for the 21st century. In 2004 the New York Times referred to me as \"perhaps the founding father of personal weblogging.\" I hope this documentary reveals that I was a privileged white male with access to technology who worked to invite as many people as possible to join him in co-creating an internet where we have a chance to honestly share of our humanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"a movie about a web site about a guy","title":"overshare: the links.net story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
