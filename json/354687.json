That's why he decides, as a testament destined to his retired father, to have himself filmed in the places he and his parents used to go to for their Sunday escapades when he was a kid. But, after leaving Bastogne, he hears on the radio that Marc Dutroux, the pedophile-torturer-murderer has just escaped the police forces. Totally upset, Didier decides to fork off to Grâce-Hologne, a little village close to Liège, to protect a potential victim of Dutroux.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11796,"logo_path":"/tx6LOQcTSqgW8ffKxovuJHjlYVw.png","name":"Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel de la FWB","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":127671,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Fondation Joseph Jacquemotte","origin_country":""},{"id":127672,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latitudes Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":127673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Amis du Travelling","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1999-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travellinckx","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
