A small suburban town is practically in marshall law because of a serial killer who can’t be caught. Police have the streets under constant surveillance, but nothing, no sign of them.  Home Sweet Home throws us right in the middle of a night where the killer has chosen a new family of unsuspecting victims. This little horror-thriller packs quite the punch with an ending you’ll never see coming.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Sweet Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
