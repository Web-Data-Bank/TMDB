The first two take place during the Great War, one in the summer of 1916, when allegiance still reigns, the other in the winter of 1916, when a convalescent soldier and his young cousin go for a walk in the woods. The third story, set in the present day, accompanies two young French soldiers, marked by the violence of the fighting in a distant and blurred war that no one seems to care about, during a July Fourth ball.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loin du front","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
