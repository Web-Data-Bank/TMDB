Bach","overview":"Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) lived his whole life in Germany and in music. This is his story, unfolded from the very places where his key life events took place.  Born into a musical family, Bach's life was almost predetermined to be in the field of music. But from a child he internalized the art and passionately pursued the development of his skills. It would result in a legacy that has enriched the world and continues to inspire, engage, and touch souls across diverse cultural boundaries now close to three hundred years later.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glory to God Alone: The Life of J.S.
