It moves through a circle of five interlocking episodes that describe the phenomenon of interruption in contemporary communication through various forms and modes, investigating causes, consequences, and side-effects. Genres shift along the episodic path of this circle, moving from documentary to essay, through collage, simulated live-coverage, and silent film. As the phenomenon of interruption is seen to be a pervasive part of these genres, the film attends to the act of watching moving images. At the center of the film is a documentary segment on the origin of the biggest upheaval in communication history: the invention of the telephone, initiated by the \"man who contracted space,\" Alexander Graham Bell.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kahIoO3yOZyPckn3jhsUZrGVZH1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circle's Short Circuit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
