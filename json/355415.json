He does not consider it a part of his filmography. For its creators, it was just a TV program, and the people who worked on it most often were being given no distinction in the credits. This document of the very origins of Sokurov gives us a notion of his \"pre-stylistic\" period, where the personality of the future great filmmaker reveals itself in spite of means and circumstances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":61304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gorkovskoe Televidenie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1974-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Automobile Gains in Reliability","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
