The film consists of a series of simple camera movements that are rendered \"diachronically\"- several different aspects of the action are presented on the screen at once. By playing with time delays between these images, new kinds of space, action, gesture, and temporality have been found. Generated from structural principles, the film is both lyrical and sensual and provokes a new understanding of time and cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z7GGCGeNvj9fkxNPQUQI2KMV6Vh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Analogies: Studies in the Movement of Time","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
