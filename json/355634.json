We follow three characters on a journey of self discovery and transformation through dance. Through the dancers’ journeys,  meetings with Contact’s founder and devotees, as well as an exploration of the underlying psychology and neuroscience, we come to see that Contact is not just a dance.  It suggests a different way of living — mindful, connected, generous, and in touch.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dancers explore the art and science of connection.","title":"An Intimate Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
