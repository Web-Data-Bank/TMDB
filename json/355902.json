In this cycle of nine films created from 1989 through 2003, Kentridge addresses the doubling and contrary sides of the self, personified in the entrepreneur/capitalist Soho and his foil, the poet/ lover Felix.  In this most recent work, pin-striped Soho Eckstein moves through a series of collisions of circumstances and recollection. In the film, the city of Johannesburg – inconstant, desperate, desiring, impenetrable – appears not so much as context as it does subject, in images of streets, facades, landscapes, and people. Familiar and recent attributes of the city appear, with one image not just suggesting another image but indicating a connection to displaced emotions and displaced histories. There are references to the street corner civil wars of daily life, and to the xenophobic violence of the last few years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zr2JMLmZAJalL4C2FUpkYAGIXtc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Other Faces","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
