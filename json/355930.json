His talents and devotion are envied by all. One evening, following a self-imposed fast, Haim-Aaron collapses and loses consciousness. The paramedics announce his death, but his father takes over resuscitation efforts and, beyond all expectations, Haim-Aaron comes back to life. After the accident, try as he might, Haim-Aaron remains apathetic to his studies. He feels overwhelmed by a sudden awakening of his body and suspects this is God testing him. He wonders if he should stray from the prescribed path and find a way to rekindle his faith...  The title means \"Rectify\" in Hebrew; nevertheless the movie is called Tikkun in the English-speaking world.","popularity":1.452,"poster_path":"/dhAcVYLsIFPcMUhRQs7HKPhaSU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plan B Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":62486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mouth Agape, The","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2015-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tikkun","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":19}
