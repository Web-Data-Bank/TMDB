In an early role, Carrie Ng leads a Thai police task force and issues a lot of orders while posing in a rather striking paramilitary uniform! Moon Lee and Yukari are sent into the jungle as undercover operatives running a sting operation. Eventually they run the gang to ground, ambushing a river opium convoy amid a string of double-crosses. Although hundreds of rounds are expended throughout the movie, the gun play tends to be formulaic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rsr1wVhw2ZYmV2rQ2IC6q2UcEi7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joe Siu International Film Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":6920,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.S.
