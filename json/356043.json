This film, narrated by George Manuel, president of the National Indian Brotherhood, presents the view of spokesmen for Canadian Indian and MÃ©tis groups. There is a sharp contrast between the official celebrations, with Queen Elizabeth II among the guests, and what Indians have to say about their lot in the Company's operations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3tfkP1iaUdngbksSszezv4bE4Rh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Side of the Ledger: An Indian View of the Hudson's Bay Company","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
