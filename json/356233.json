During the 1970s dictatorship, he broke sexual taboos with a \"strange\" behavior on stage and became one of the most famous brazilian singers. Inspired in Cassiano Ricardo's concrete poems and the experimental music of Ney's repertoire, \"Bird-Man\" explores a sound and visual lyrical aesthetic of high contrasts that approximates man to nature's feelings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a8g3txR6a4K80vgko7LhKsbXcrc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bird-Man","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
