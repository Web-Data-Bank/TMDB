The film opens with the sextet humiliating a respected painter's portraits of them, driving the man to a sus­picious suicide. Later, while celebrating his son's impending marriage into a wealthy family, Ibaragiya releases six pigeons from a pleasure boat, each with a rolled up drawing of one of the beauties tied to their legs. He offers a cash reward to whomever recovers the pictures, but they instead become death notices of which of the six are next to die.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hbTXkt1qvJGwOA1Aq3b4lLRUzvU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shintoho Pictures","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1956-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Casebooks of Dandy Sashichi: 6 Famous Beauties","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
