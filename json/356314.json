The Noon Gun sends a rattle through the old wooden homes of the North End. Within one of these homes, an elderly woman dotes over her graffiti writer grandson. An interracial couple walk tensely down a side street. A recovering alcoholic cop lectures his street-wizened young partner as they walk the beat. On one day in particular, the Noon Gun blast ties these groups into a sequence of events. As these events unfold, each group’s perspective grows, obscuring reality and ultimately effecting each other’s lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pQAWRjvqYWu1eQDfU2UD4EXcKMH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noon Gun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
