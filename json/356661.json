Sound like the mantou scenario from would-be blockbuster The Promise? No, it's not another video spoof of Chen Kaige's stinker. It's the beginning of The Jimmy Hat (Xinjiekou), a movie about young ruffians in the hutongs 20 years ago. Is it another version of Wan Zhu, Wang Shuo's paean to hooliganism? Or is it a reproduction of Zhang Yuan's Beijing Bastards? First-time director Xue Cun summarizes this movie in three words: baozi, women and condoms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pu2ZoWs8Qw3XwZnKytPPCfOKiD0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jimmy Hat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
