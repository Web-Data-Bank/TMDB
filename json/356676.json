Paddling into waves was out of the question and the Billabong Pro was given a layday. In one of the most talked about sessions of the decade, history was made as a handful of international chargers whipped into some of the most nightmarish waves ever surfed in Tahiti. The swell proved to be so immense that the Tahitian government issued a \"Code Red\" warning, banning the surrounding seas of boats and watercraft. The lineup at Teahupoo, it seems, was an exception.  See the historic day through the eyes of two surfers -- the young gun Laurie Towner and the veteran Dylan Longbottom -- as they catch some of the biggest, most dangerous surf ever recorded, much of it captured with the super slow motion Phantom Camera for never-before-seen imagery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The heaviest wave in the world, just threw a temper-tantrum","title":"Teahupoo: CODE RED","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
