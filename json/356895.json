None of them takes action or calls the police. 37 tells the story of a few of these people and what led up to the night when they unexplainably remained passive observers. The film is a convincing portrayal of a borough in change and a time characterized by racism, the Civil Rights Movement and political shifts. The actual event that inspired the filmâ€™s plot has been called a symbol for the moment when America lost its innocence. The director Puk Grasten skillfully weaves into her feature film debut various fates, dreams and family conflicts by leading us through an apartment building that comes to bear a collective failure.","popularity":3.364,"poster_path":"/im8VaD4tu7lChxF9tUOG1H9sFzp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regner Grasten Film","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":35798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Game 7 Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This Poster will Be Seen But Not Heard.
