Pieter and Sonja (played by Reynard Slabbert and Juanita De Villiers) still love each other, but question their relationship. Sonja feels the fact that they can’t fall pregnant is a sign that the relationship is in serious trouble. Pieter had a vasectomy because he chose to focus on his career as a successful lawyer but keeps this dark secret from Sonja. A dream holiday in paradise might be the answer… but an accident along the way sends them on an unexpected adventure.","popularity":0.905,"poster_path":"/rvdGaKKLpyklTtWZgrRt0772weO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62094,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afrikaans Film","origin_country":"ZA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2015-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome in Paradise","title":"Summer Sun","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
