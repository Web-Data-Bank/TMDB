Long desiring to help the weak, Kensuke Okochi gets a job at an attorney’s office while he and his wife, also blind, look forward to their first child. When a plaintiff in a divorce case decides to withdraw from litigation, Kensuke worries at first that it has to do with his own perceived inadequacies as a lawyer, but a few days later, he is visited by the female plaintiff, Satomi, showing injuries to her body. While it appears an open and shut case of domestic violence with an audio recording as proof, Kensuke detects a “certain scent” coming from the plaintiff which gives him pause as to her real intentions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lRTHfFLAqyumrNJNHw8buRA0Zox.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73591,"logo_path":"/1y1nlmPPWqFwGkTSoKMVvwjNzBr.png","name":"TELEPACK","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":1393,"logo_path":"/lUACMATs6jcscXIrzNCQzbvNVN5.png","name":"TBS","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Justice is Blind: The Moving Tale of a Vision-Impaired Lawyer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
