Just before the last few reach the other side, the East German border guards notice the escape and open fire. Remarkably, all the refugees and their escape agents make it out of the tunnel unscathed, but one border guard is dead: 21-year-old officer Egon Schultz.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fb3UpWAZlkxDY7XIWMoG8yELhDn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ziegler Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hero's Death","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
