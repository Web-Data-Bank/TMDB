Having regained his sight he does not make this known to his household, but quietly observes them for a time and sees how his servants rob him and even his daughter imposes upon him. Discouraged at his findings he goes out upon the highway where he again meets Christ, but this time He is carrying His cross and being led to Calvary. The sight of the suffering Savior teaches him to forgive his offenders.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/hLDNy2IX1lBVqyOa1jOi9yu4zmd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1909-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blind Man of Jerusalem","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
