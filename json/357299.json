After a saxophonist starts playing at a particular nightspot, a thug from the Yakuza adopts him as a special friend for no greater reason than he plays one of his favorite songs well. As the dangerous life of the gangster intertwines with that of the musician, it brings harm to the musician's girlfriend, who is raped. This changes the young saxophonist's attitude about his patron, but his Yakuza \"friend\" is still too embroiled in his own problems to worry about anything else.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/swzKeG8GNjbsUDJtFAGweCu0sta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2073,"logo_path":"/6FlTZGliYTN2HaS9Qq6tCdZItWc.png","name":"KADOKAWA","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cabaret","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
