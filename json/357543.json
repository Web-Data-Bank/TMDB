Its semi-animated graphics format conveys more than a little of the whimsy and infectious spirit in the eight-string guitarist's music, even as the bios of the individual band members and production credits thoroughly cover the academic side of this project. The segment featuring Charlie solo is a great opportunity to see how he plays his custom-designed guitar. You have to marvel at what a self-deprecating musician this Bay-area native is, but never more so than on \"Recess,\" where he refuses to show off or flaunt his technique in any way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Vn4a8t9AfTcfp6PP7TAcn9mk8u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charlie Hunter Quintet - Right Now Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
