All Padstownians participate in the event, which has now become a tourist attraction drawing over tens of thousands of annual visitors. Folklorists Alan Lomax and Peter Kennedy and filmmaker George Pickow collected footage at the festival in 1951, producing a pioneering work in the use of sound, low-light photography, and conversational presentation of narrative. A favorite of Margaret Mead, who used it in her classes, the film circulated widely and continues to have influence today, especially in the neo-Pagan community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ajb5QVhQvyvqnWzMKYbQHbA0LEM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80719,"logo_path":null,"name":"Folk Films","origin_country":""},{"id":80720,"logo_path":null,"name":"English Folk Dance and Song Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1953-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oss Oss Wee Oss","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
