In 1987, a 19-year-old youth, Julian Knight, took two rifles and a shotgun, and walked out into Hoddle Street, a main thoroughfare of Melbourne. Forty-five minutes later six people were dead, one was dying, and 19 were wounded. This is the story of what happened the night before the massacre, what happened on the night, and what happened afterwards. It tells why the killer did it, and asks what can be done to prevent others from doing it again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hoddle Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
