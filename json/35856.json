When Herzl (155 kilos), the main protagonist, loses his job as a cook and starts working as a dishwasher in a Japanese restaurant in Ramle he discovers the world of Sumo where large people such as himself are honored and appreciated. Through Kitano (60 kilos), the restaurant owner, a former Sumo coach in Japan (who is supposedly hiding from the Yakuza in Israel), he falls in love with a sport involving \"two fatsos in diapers and girly hairdos\". Herzl wants Kitano to be their coach but Kitano is reluctant - they first have to earn their spurs. \"A MATTER OF SIZE\" is a comedy about a ‘coming out’ of a different kind - overweight people learning to accept themselves.","popularity":1.674,"poster_path":"/ruyB1RYgumzscnr8P8IEx9UPzgo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23437,"logo_path":null,"name":"K5 Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2009-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Matter of Size","video":false,"vote_average":5.789,"vote_count":19}
