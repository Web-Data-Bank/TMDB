To this green centre of a great industrial area, the first of the National Parks, holidaymakers come throughout the year to enjoy a wide variety of scenery and of pastimes. Some visitors come to glide, others to go 'caving' or climbing, boating or fishing. The lovely surroundings vary from the windy flat tops of heath with their rocky outcrops to the lush sheltered dales of the Manifiold, the Derwent and the Dove; from the simple stone cottages of the quiet villages to the historic architecture of Ashbourne, Bakewell and Buxton, and the great houses of the past like Chatsworth and Haddon Hall.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Peak District","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
