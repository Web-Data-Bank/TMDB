Ryan Duffy went to Colombia to check out a strange and powerful drug called Scopolamine, also known as \"The Devil's Breath.\"  It's a substance so intense that it renders a person incapable of exercising free will.  The first few days in the country were a harrowing montage of freaked-out dealers and unimaginable horror stories about Scopolamine.  After meeting only a few people with firsthand experience, the story took a far darker turn than we ever could have imagined.","popularity":0.933,"poster_path":"/xBTT7UrKp2gaMAnclEHrgVhuZbh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17209,"logo_path":"/khOQX3iJuSmaFWrL3w4LijbtnJZ.png","name":"VICE Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World's Scariest Drug: The Devil's Breath","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
