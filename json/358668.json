Crammed beyond its capacity, imperfectly fastened, inadequately and confusedly labelled, the railways transport it from station to station, seeking its true abode. Finally, one of its owners comes to the nightmare tribunal where those who maltreat their luggage are dealt with. Did it happen? Was it a dream? Be warned. See this film. Avoid making yours 'a desperate case'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jAWNliP7aPdDRz86LBQxCnsrfuO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52835,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Transport Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1958-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Desperate Case","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
