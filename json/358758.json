A young journalist, Arvid, falls in love with a girl but won't commit himself to marrying her. She marries an older and richer man and he's pushed into marrying the girl he's been sleeping with.  He meets his first love again, and she leaves her husband to have an affair with him, but he still cannot bring himself to leave his wife. Although Anja Breien has changed the character of the girl to make her less of a femme fatale and more of an emancipated woman, the film's central concern is the young man who cannot make up his mind what to do with his life.","popularity":0.697,"poster_path":"/cJtqv4q3pyeWcqOk3YLH0uL4qbj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norsk Film","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":1728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandrews","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1977-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Games of Love and Loneliness","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
