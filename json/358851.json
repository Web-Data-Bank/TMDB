The man is out of work and spends his days walking the streets, without so much as a cent in his pocket to buy food. He’s so weak that he collapses in front of a store window. The store’s owner, an elderly man, comes to the man’s aid and offers him a job. His new job requires him to spend all day sitting and keeping watch on the small room at the end of a corridor.","popularity":1.083,"poster_path":"/v02Kn7crOzj3wvYPg1gFWNIowY7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Conseil Général de la Drôme","origin_country":""},{"id":8212,"logo_path":"/pkWt7XNwx5GssnXmTsXLKNpalaH.png","name":"Folimage","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":73885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Film Bilder","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":311,"logo_path":"/TNGvZ8zOklntjPP3EcsHtrR8Rc.png","name":"PROCIREP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":309,"logo_path":"/eVdJe4ha50lW1Eop1tq93TMh1XW.png","name":"Angoa-Agicoa","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":73886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ville de Valence","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le couloir","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8}
