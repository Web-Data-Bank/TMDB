Each gets their close-up and the many choreographed incidents happening together, and impossible to sort out, are given time out of the welter of events to shine. While it seems a mistake to break apart the wonderful muchness of the original, it's fun to see one action centered while others we've become familiar with repeat around it in the grand clockwork mechanism that is cinema. Actions made familiar take off into abstract permutations, veering in and out of recognition. God appears, centering the commotion, but splits when the crowd deserts his act to go after Tom.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n6YdhvoLWSiXZe4dckkEx53rqp9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to the Scene of the Crime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
