Duncan Renaldo and Leo Carrillo return as Cisco and Pancho, roles they'd carry over into a popular 1950s TV series. Once more stumbling into a dangerous situation, Cisco and Pancho risk their own necks by saving an innocent man from hanging. Eventually, our heroes learn that a corrupt political machine is behind the killing. Leading lady Kippie Valez is cast as \"herself,\" which must have meant more in 1949 than it does today. Unlike the subsequent TV series, Daring Caballero does not end with the leading actors reciting their standard mantra \"Oh, Pancho! Oh, Cisco!\"","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/y0OiAVbqBQwNxHB4xZumHanqDm2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62906,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inter American Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Thrill After Thrill!","title":"The Daring Caballero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
