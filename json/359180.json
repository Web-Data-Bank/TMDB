This also extends to the protagonist of the film, a head on a foot without a body or arms who pads wearily through the depressing surroundings. Upon seeing various figures in the sky, he begins to copy their movements. To his surprise, he himself manages to grow wings and takes to the skies. But his attempt at flight ends in a sobering manner however, as it is revealed that flying creatures are just restricted in their range.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/pxgnSsVe5wy41wwcGQcPqTY9Q2C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55763,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEFA-Studio für Trickfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Einmart","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
