Absence, in this case, refreshes their memory of the love they have shared, and they take to meeting one another furtively in hotel rooms for sex and affection. One summer, as each of their daughters families takes them on separate vacations, they have had enough, and elope, finding contentment as lighthouse keepers off the coast of Sicily.","popularity":0.955,"poster_path":"/8sjse1cuMnMFEJ7e8zSxUxzGvYn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":641,"logo_path":"/w8flpSJntsxVCMkIU1qeg1kJcJh.png","name":"Titanus","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":7811,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cit√© Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":96667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Videoschermo","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1989-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merry Christmas...
