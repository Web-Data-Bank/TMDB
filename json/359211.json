Action: Study depicts Kerr’s daughter playing on the shores of Georgian Bay, but could easily be mistaken as a work of abstract animation. Kerr combines innovative hand-held techniques with the ultra-sensitivity of the film stock to create a startling wash of jagged, erratic, and constantly dynamic compositions of black and white. Indeed, at times reality seems to melt in front of us.","popularity":1.342,"poster_path":"/ejPHq0SxnTO78Zk28IjSuUWxTwt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Action: Study","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
