Like every night, the audience take their seats and the play begins. Suddenly, the lights on stage go out. A group of young people, dressed in black and carrying guns, come up on stage. They apologize for the interruption and invite people from the audience to participate on stage. The play resumes with a main difference; life imitates art and not the opposite.","popularity":1.187,"poster_path":"/kk7IziEgknDoahwLgAvy0MizPCW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6773,"logo_path":"/thh8BxybjvOoI618djeXzwhGfh4.png","name":"NOVA","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13833,"logo_path":"/bZCoxiXwO6VibQREGuFc88ermO2.png","name":"Homemade Films","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":27336,"logo_path":null,"name":"EZ Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":63063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinephase","origin_country":""},{"id":63064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Digital District","origin_country":""},{"id":63065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Post Faust Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":63066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prosenghisi Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":63067,"logo_path":null,"name":"Squaredsquare Films","origin_country":""},{"id":123751,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pan Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2016-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interruption","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":18}
