He convinces the governor to stage a musical in an old chapel next to the prison's outer wall. He rounds up volunteer actors and puts his escape plan into production. Two other barriers, besides the wall, confront him: the arrival of a nasty inmate, John Toombes, who insists on joining the escape, and Jimmy's feelings of attraction for Anabel, a social worker who agrees to appear in the play. Opening night approaches: is this Jimmy's breakout performance?","popularity":4.428,"poster_path":"/vnhG3TQdHpOT0ZNQljhEl0RDSGC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucky Break Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":2651,"logo_path":"/rmfShgOyHdGSljYXcvZsbVGSRGV.png","name":"Fragile Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/e8EXNSfwr5E9d3TR8dHKbQnQK4W.png","name":"Film4 Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":191,"logo_path":"/d5tPJd8jGLtJC5cp9NG0HeoTyoe.png","name":"Senator Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":14,"logo_path":"/m6AHu84oZQxvq7n1rsvMNJIAsMu.png","name":"Miramax","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucky Break","video":false,"vote_average":6.207,"vote_count":29}
