Within this hypnotic urban hell, what starts as an unstable and hesitant apprenticeship evolves into a struggle for self-control.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kkz5RLi9d2QftOLsYxM4bZyWhVB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27336,"logo_path":null,"name":"EZ Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":80308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cassis Films","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2015-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
