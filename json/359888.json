As they join forces with the likes of a pregnant woman, a moronic arms dealer, and a mentally challenged man, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombie mayhem. While this uprising of zombies has overwhelmed the city, Mr. Roberts, the CEO of R2 Pharmaceuticals, has sent in a team of mercenaries known as the S.I.E.G.E into Cyrene City to recover the only known antidote for his own financial gain. Not Another Zombie Movie... About the Living Dead is a hilarious twisted tale about survival versus morality during a zombie apocalypse. Watch as these survivors discover there is no such thing as a hero when zombies are trying to eat your face off.","popularity":1.032,"poster_path":"/onpSYutLPlGiUzJaC96AgbwVMET.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diesel World Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":105044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jay Davis Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-31","revenue":15000,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Another Zombie Movie....About the Living Dead","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
