In a blend of land art performance and road movie, artist duo Bigert &amp; Bergström travel to the US tornado belt with their special machine-sculpture, the Tornado Diverter. The goal: To stop a tornado. Along the way, we see historical examples of how the science of meteorology developed in symbiosis with military goals and how these visions evolved into modern ideas of geo-engineering. Controversial ideas with socio-political consequences, spotlighting the big question of who is really entitled to modified weather.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2012-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weather War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
