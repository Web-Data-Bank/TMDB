The property had recently been left to rot, held in lien by a bank. Hurricanes washed away the sculpture. I learned about the artist who created this landmark, Lewis Vandercar (1913-1988), who began as a painter. His practice grew along with his notoriety for spell-casting and telepathy. Inspired by Vandercar’s interest in parallel possibility, I combined these images with text from local newspaper articles in a haunted-house film that both engages with and looks beyond the material world.”—Mike Stoltz","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5vw0cIh6H4fY2Afgg0qztifa4su.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Half Human, Half Vapor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
