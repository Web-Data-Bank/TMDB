It stuck in my mind. Now that I think about it, Brakhage may have meant this as a joke. He said, “Someday Hollywood will probably make a film about us,”  ‘us’ meaning the experimental filmmakers  “and I wonder which actors will play us?” Think about that first of all: the idea that Hollywood would make a film about experimental filmmakers is totally ridiculous. The fact that one would think about which actor was going to play me at some time in the future, I think that’s very funny. Eventually it germinated in my mind and I thought it was an interesting idea… A film about experimental filmmakers, especially in the very formative period, approximately 1968 to 1972.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nZD9u4ZMk40RRhyPBM8B77aT6DB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Excerpts from a Work in Progress (Undesirables)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
