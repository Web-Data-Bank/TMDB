Mats Bigert &amp; Lars Bergström's film “The Last Supper” focuses on this discrepancy between historical “meaning” and contemporary use of a tradition that has lost its connection with the past. The main character is the former death row chef Brian Price, who reconstructs one of the 200 final meals that he prepared during his time as inmate in Huntsville State Prison, Texas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Supper","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
