They live in the selva, in a region that has been preserved from modern influence for many centuries. Today, however, as modern civilization is penetrating the forest to exploit its wealth, Guarani culture is fading. For the past decades, large industrial groups have been threatening the flora and fauna. The Guarani are one of the last traditional tribes of South America, with only 87 members left. This film paints the intimate portrait of a people struggling to preserve their traditional ways.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Guarani","iso_639_1":"gn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guarani, People of the Selva","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
