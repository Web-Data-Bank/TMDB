Every summer, this particular colony of penguins returns from an intensive spell of deep sea fishing to its breeding grounds alongside the post office, trekking nearly two miles across sea ice and snow to get there when the weather is especially bad. They rush to find a partner, build a nest, lay eggs and protect those eggs from predators, and then finally get down to the task of raising their young. We see their four-month drama unfold against the backdrop of their lives - primarily, the comings and goings of cruise ships, bringing enthusiastic tourists to photograph the penguins and their chicks, and to buy postcards to send to friends and family around the world - from the Penguin Post Office.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dyM72ZbUMIrQmoryQTUKi8puE6a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penguin Post Office","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
