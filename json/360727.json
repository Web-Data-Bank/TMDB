He tells Susan, a recent divorcée who is disenchanted with love and men, that the only way she is going to get over her ex-husband is to watch him have sex with some other woman. When she acquiesces to her shrink's suggestion, Poon insists that he also be present for professional reasons. Meanwhile he coerces his Mainland-born nurse Siu-ying to attend these swingers' parties posing as his wife. There Siu-yang meets Lee Keung, a love-starved divorcee, who falls for the comely young nurse. Soon the two long to flee the soulless, bacchanalian group with which they have become intertwined.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Mani3IN1RBrhVojTZMz7bFliyi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lotus Cinevision Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1993-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Wild Party","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
