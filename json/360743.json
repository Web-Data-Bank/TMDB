In this film writer/director Peter Tammer explores the FEAR OF THE DARK through the person of the actor Robert Ratti, holding together the hopes and fears of the performer who is facing survival on a day-to-day basis for the opportunity to work in the future. This visual fantasy confronts a level of consciousness we've all touched, reminding us that we were not alone in the dark, facing a reality we dare not imagine.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fear of the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
