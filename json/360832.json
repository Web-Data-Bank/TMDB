We follow narrator Amy Eldon on a personal journey to find meaning in the death of her older brother, 22-year-old Reuters photographer Dan Eldon. Dan was among a group of five journalists attacked by a mob during the Somali famine in 1993; he and three others were stoned to death. As she interviews other journalists and the sole surviving witness to Dan's death, we see her attain the peace she sought.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dying to Tell the Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
