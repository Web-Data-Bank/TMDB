But what happens when our bodies and desires do not behave?  A handsome couple saves their first kiss for the altar; a gay son comes out to his famous family; a transgender man searches for authenticity; and a feminist confronts double standards. While the control of desire is universal, the salvation of these people depends upon it.  Since the 1990s, the Purity Movement has been at the center of a national conversation about sexuality that extends from the pew into the Oval Office. Give Me Sex Jesus invites you into the pleasure, shame, and humor at the intersection of faith and sex in America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4gEm47Xner8YiXgJm97bDgg2V96.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47112,"logo_path":"/uMmoG3iU693MFYHWV1n6sjIed7s.png","name":"Kickstarter","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What happens when our bodies and desires do not behave?","title":"Give Me Sex Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
