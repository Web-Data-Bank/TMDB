Four-year-old Violet, teenaged Nicholas and adult Paula occupy different positions on the autism spectrum, but they are all at pivotal moments in their lives. How they and the people around them work out their perceptual and behavioral differences becomes a remarkable reflection of the \"neurotypical\" world — the world of the non-autistic — revealing inventive adaptations on each side and an emerging critique of both what it means to be normal and what it means to be human.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8ppG5dUpIbUcKpX8CeyrzdK1qUH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Normal is a cycle on a washing machine","title":"Neurotypical","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
