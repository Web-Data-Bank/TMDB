One of the dads is their manager; we hear from him and one of the moms at whose house they rehearse. The lads talk about their playing, singing, and song writing. The gig is a success and all the CDs sell.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/drtdqYS1C1ljjeuxP2JrR1nDWj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Metal Jr.","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
