However, the initial happiness that Kaoru finds in the company of her beautiful sister-in-law is frustrated by her brother Mitsuo, Miyoko's husband, who intervenes in their budding passion. Full of unspoken words, deeply suggestive mise-en-scène, and forbidden glances, Fukujuso is a compelling melodrama that surprises us with its potent homoeroticism, especially considering its year of production.","popularity":1.121,"poster_path":"/bEz9i6R31LcNGRJKwiwyN8rxfSe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shinkô Kinema","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1935-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scent of Pheasant’s Eye: An Episode from the Tales of Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
