The film traces the evolution of Norma's career from Broadway actress in the '40s, through her ground-breaking work in creative movement with disabled and mentally retarded children in the '60s, to her present work as a dance therapist with adults. Utilizing drawing, music, theater, and dance in the context of other modes of therapy, her work has proved extraordinarily beneficial for handicapped individuals, as well as providing cathartic healing experiences for those with deep emotional scars; And her work with children who were blind, deaf, or autistic has became a model.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64168,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bushy Theater, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Time To Dance: The Life and Work of Norma Canner","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
