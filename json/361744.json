Feeling out of place amongst the tight-knit group of other parents at the park, doubted by her husband, and judged by her newly hired nanny, Liz is drawn to factory worker Rosa, a plain-talking single mother she meets at the swings one day. Despite Liz’s liberation upon finding a bold new confidante, the friends’ increasingly apparent class differences, along with swirling rumors about Rosa’s motives and muddy family situation, feed Liz’s suspicions that her new pal might be a sinister influence on her already fragile life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5J4ch5gBDcuXPrq2m4cEnMaa1sY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6517,"logo_path":"/hFeSHlwvkYkN4sGbKdRmjqhZshQ.png","name":"Campo Cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":53766,"logo_path":"/bxhF6lhto38us6TVa3dba79HtdW.png","name":"Mutante Cine","origin_country":"UY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2015-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Friend from the Park","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":14}
