It began in 1998 as a proposed showreel piece, but then escalated into an unstoppable monstrosity that continued to absorb my life (and savings) until 2006. I created all sound, music and vision for the film. Running time is 7 minutes.","popularity":1.202,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passenger","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":12}
