Many Eons ago, the Orichalcum was split into three and landed on Earth. The metal then took the form of three relics: Skanda’s Vajra, Jew’s Cross, and the Sword of Alexander. Anyone able to re-unite these three Orichalcum relics would then obtain the powers of a God. Now two rival aliens are in a heated race to reunite the Orichalcum. They land in Edo era Tokyo where the relics are thought to exist.","popularity":1.412,"poster_path":"/wsTKW8hkC0OzZKZH3SRvpmbx1KY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4868,"logo_path":"/3ExeT4zGXBFU7ei1crOvuzKnc1z.png","name":"Asahi Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":6954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enterbrain","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-04-07","revenue":1723861,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sword of Alexander","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6}
