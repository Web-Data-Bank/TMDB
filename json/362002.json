Using fire as a metaphor for technology, the film looks at the advances of our civilization and how the recklessness of unchecked technology is now choking out the environment and poisoning our bodies. Interviews with the biggest names in the health and green space create compelling context and arguments for how we can better coexist with nature. \"Origins\" shows how man, technology, and nature can walk together in balance.","popularity":1.452,"poster_path":"/dVf5yCofaLRsKWG6XIv8JbYqIJm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vital Origins Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Our Roots.
