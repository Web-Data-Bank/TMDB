The film tells a great “thriller” story of the ideological madness which characterised the totalitarian psychology having left multiple consequences felt up to our very days. It stresses similarities between totalitarian regimes defending their taboos on the example of the persecution of the most important Yugoslav film authors. Those film authors have, however, made world careers and inspired many later authors. The film is the beginning of a debt pay-off to the most significant Yugoslav film authors.","popularity":0.61,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28394,"logo_path":"/uayh0bscJCf5StAz27R0XRyZKuj.png","name":"Art \u0026 Popcorn","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2007-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Censored without Censorship","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
