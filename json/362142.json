Dessa, a 16-year-old girl and a victim of child molestation, is being relentlessly bullied by three of her classmates as she tries hard to improve on herself. Amy, a junior high school student on the other hand is a social climber trying her best to please everyone but ended up being hated and despised. Gelo, an elementary pupil with average skills suffers emotional pain after a series of physical and mental abuse by his classmate and former basketball teammate. One final incident of bullying sends him over the edge and leads him to almost commit an act of violence that stunned the entire school community. The whole story is presented comically, highly amusing and entertaining for minor audiences but the message of bullying is emphasized and addressed.","popularity":1.714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64558,"logo_path":null,"name":"Exogain Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Larong Bata","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
