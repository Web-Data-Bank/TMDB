Retrograde Premonition looks and sounds like floating mind, the vicissitudes of thought, feeling, and the senses. Not limited by the portrayal of actual events, this video works to encourage a roaming consciousness through images and sounds that may or may not be present. Pierce shoots these videos with a digital still camera hand held at long exposures and then weaves the stills into video shots. Each individual image bears the mark of time from motion blur, a blur that may in fact contradict the apparent motion of the frame. He composes the entire sound scape once picture editing is complete.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Retrograde Premonition","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
