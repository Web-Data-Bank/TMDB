Four hundred years later, however, this treaty – among many others – has not been honoured and a strong Indigenous mobilization is rising across North America in reaction. Maracle’s formidable documentary revisits this agreement and examines the Indigenous response to this broken agreement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grandfather of All Treaties","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
