Young Carlos faces the forgetfulness of old Carlos, who doesn't recognize his own appearance. They get a package. But the package seems odd. The knot that ties, the smell, the handwriting on the envelope: this could only be sent by his father, Ernesto, who has been dead for many years. A father who always created unusual situations. In this time warp, Carlos is split in two: one Carlos remembers and the other forgets the moments he spent with his father.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cUe78tCYn26SJKvSSSopXMNz2XV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinossaurus Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oblivious Memory","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
