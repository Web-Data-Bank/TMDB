The revelation of this habitat creates a visual serenity rarely found within the quivering feedback lines previously employed in Ratté’s work. The simplicity and exactness of the vertical lines that dance across the screen in Habitat suggest a kind of transcendental arrival at a near-perfect modular frequency where the input and output harmonize. These lines are pulled back like stage curtains to expose once more the gleaming horizon, this time delicately tinged with a rainbow spectrum created from gamma ramped signal saturation.\"  - Nicholas O'Brien","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Undervolt \u0026 Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Habitat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
