In all three pieces – Littoral Zones, Landfall, and Habitat – Ratté uses her signature modulator technique to intricately layer a series of moirés and checkerboards that bring depth to the otherwise flat surface of the video screen. Where others create depth through recording or simulating hallways and tunnels, Ratté bends the signal of the video itself to carve out corridors of an undetermined distance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eKNeV7dmjzMEV4G8HLMn6Qa5A0L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Undervolt \u0026 Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
