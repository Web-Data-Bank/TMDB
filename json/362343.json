It tells the deeply moving story of a young boy who must learn what heroism and courage are before he rises from lowly peasant to shining knight. Based on the bestselling books by Kirsten Boie.","popularity":1.849,"poster_path":"/zhMjA9MetWql9jsp6Wun3NkpIzM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Eyes Fiction","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":36357,"logo_path":"/zdhANDGx0iptVURkRu6kaq2CRu4.png","name":"WunderWerk","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":608,"logo_path":"/dD2Do4GHXAql5c4LjXCbEOvxbFg.png","name":"Dor Film Production Company","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":12372,"logo_path":null,"name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trenk, the Little Knight","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":10}
