When Charlotte was only 3 months old she went into a violent seizure lasting around half an hour. Charlottes parents rushed her to the hospital where a full work up revealed nothing about her condition and within only a week she began to seize on a regular basis up to two hours at a time. Charlotte had been diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy. When she turned 2 Charlotte had begun to seize hundreds of times in a single week and her cognitive function was rapidly declining. Charlotte finally found a treatment in the form of a special breed of marijuana plant that was low in THC while high in CBD. This has completely changed the Figi familyâ€™s life and Charlotte suffers from only one or two seizures every week or two which are much less severe than those she experienced prior to treatment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vgDvB6EDbj0ALJvM0RPsY6QpgCo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weed: A Dr. Sanjay Gupta Special","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
