I've always been curious about his shooting scene. All along the winter I've followed Wang Bing with my camera from the psychiatric hospital in the nameless suburb city to the jungle near the border to Laos. There are the zona folded in wind and fog. This documentary is the record of that winter, the essay about the people of China, and the adventure-action movie done by friendship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mjChEAPnBNh4yOkVQHcFp0wTViw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122340,"logo_path":null,"name":"KINO","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":20250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mountain Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2018-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":235,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night and Fog in Zona","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
