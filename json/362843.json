The DVD discusses the process of recreating the partially lost opera for its first performance in nearly 70 years. Director Robert Benedetti narrates the film as a documentary on the recreation process and as a guide to the surreal plot of the opera itself. A stage performance of the opera (translated into English) comprises the bulk of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Victory Over the Sun: A Recreation of the 1913 Performance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
