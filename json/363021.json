The Host sets out on its own exploration, to decipher signs from the fragmented images buried in the BP archive. This journey through the past interweaves a number of stories drawn from both personal memory and the records of an imperial history, which builds a picture of a 20th-century colonial encounter. The Host is a personal essay film about the stories we tell about ourselves and others, the facts and fictions we live by, and their consequences. Followed by a discussion with Miranda Pennell.","popularity":2.545,"poster_path":"/qqEpczHJfvSH2mgglMqvsw41VBH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Host","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
