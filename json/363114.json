Their mission is to cover 4,233 miles in one enormous stage race, traversing through ten states in a transcontinental adventure of epic proportions.  Inspired To Ride follows closely the journey of a handful of these cyclists as they prepare, compete and experience what riding 300 miles a day feels like with only a few hours sleep. They will rely solely on their fitness, meticulously chosen gear and mental fortitude to get them to the finish. And to make it even more interesting, they’ll be self-supported – no crew, no follow vehicles and no prize money waiting at the end.","popularity":1.744,"poster_path":"/csFOHvwSmCVpadINAnRwRLiHPaF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Odyssey Across America","title":"Inspired to Ride","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4}
