One of the largest pelicans in the pelican family, with a light skeleton and a wingspan of over eight feet, it can be airborne all day and deep into the night, riding far and high on rising thermals. When rare weather systems bring heavy rains, huge numbers of Australian pelicans abandon the sea and coastal waters and embark on a mass pilgrimage to a place a thousand miles inland. Itâ€™s the last place you would look for one of their kind, the Australian Outback, one of the driest, hottest places on the planet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15964,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outback Pelicans","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
