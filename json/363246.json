Afree-form take on the current trend of cosmetic obsession and the immortal quality of painting, the film searches for \"whats on the inside\". Topical news stories (such as the US military offering free cosmetic surgery) and musical film sequences are created with paint-on-glass animation, found footage and documentary techniques. The music was commissioned for the film. Selected musicians, including New Zealands Hip-Hop artist, \"Coco Solid\" and \"Half Japanese\" founder Jad Fair, wrote and recorded humorously cynical songs about the cosmetic craze. Also included is a rare appearance by the Dutch Ambassador of Cosmetic Surgery, Marijke Helwegen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/77PvJjPxtldENNpg0iotPbwH9Eo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cosmetic Emergency","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
