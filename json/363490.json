It is an elegy. The photograph is connected with images that are part of our collective memory: extracts from newsreels of World War II that have been reworked and transformed through various optical and electronic processes. World War II was a condensation of violence (biological and environmental destructions, racism, ethnic clearing, and persecution of people who are different…) and ongoing wars perpetuate that violence. This work is a metaphorical representation of all past, present and future wars. Constructed on the dramatic tension between the violence of wars and the presence of the intersex hermaphroditic “Angel”: Their eyes are bandaged; they are a symbol for difference, having an ambiguous position: observer, witness, victim or judge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":98567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eikona","origin_country":""},{"id":98568,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.S.T.A.R.T.I.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem for the 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
