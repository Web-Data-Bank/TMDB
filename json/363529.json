Despite their social limitations, both dream of getting married, but straight identifying John refuses to tie the knot until transsexual Martine gets a real vagina. The only problem: no doctor in Canada will perform operation because Martine's obesity makes her too great of a surgical risk. Will Martine and John find the happiness together that they deserve? Transfixed is a deeply human story about love, freedom, and self-actualization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d5XF1uMQDGMlD2FZmp4ReGDSt5w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What happens when two people are so unique, so different, that they break every possible convention?","title":"Transfixed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
