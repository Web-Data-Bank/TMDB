After those events Edward Gierek replaced Władysław Gomułka as party first secretary and promised redical change in style and methods of ruling. Kieślowski shows the skepticism of workers and their attitude to party members. He also pictures conflicts inside the party (PZPR) and usual work in shipyard. The political criticism of this movie made it a target of censorship – it was suspended and cut against the will of director.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9vD1cqahjr22RJ7fb87SvpQw8g2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Workers '71: Nothing About Us Without Us","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
