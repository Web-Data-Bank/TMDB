Cavell had been arrested for sheltering Allied soldiers and aiding their escape. Directed by and starring former circus performer Percy Moran, with Cora Lee in the title role, what this film lacks in completeness (only 11 of 80 minutes survive) it makes up for in sheer drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2qRC8TnYygdOb9bNKptR0FId4Di.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phoenix Film Agency","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1915-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nurse and Martyr","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
