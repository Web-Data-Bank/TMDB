Painted Land weaves seamlessly the experiences of  Lawren Harris, J.E.H. MacDonald, A.Y. Jackson, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, Franklin Carmichael and A.J. Casson – with the adventures of three modern day sleuths. Historian Michael Burtch, and the writer and photographer team of Gary and Joanie McGuffin are determined to track down the precise locations of these famous paintings. Archival film, letters, journals and photographs of the artists – some of which have never been seen in public – take the viewers back in time.","popularity":0.875,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28800,"logo_path":null,"name":"White Pine Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painted Land: In Search of the Group of Seven","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
