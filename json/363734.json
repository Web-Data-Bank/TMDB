They bound him in chains and take him from one village to another, torturing him in public so he could tell the names from his movement. Bewildered by his resisting power, the Germans tend to break him down and destroy the pride which is his answer to their torture. Frenzied of powerlessness, they ultimately choose the most horrifying death - they buried him alive in the sand that will cover the last trait of him, but he died victorious: He died for his thing.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/jfWLFGcqYLuk99kMfPJ9XQ4j52o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kino Klub Pančevo","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1970-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zarki","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
