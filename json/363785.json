Passages of blackness sporadically dissolve under the fitful internal illumination of sparklers, which light up to reveal Sulilat’s unorthodox temple populated with a fantastical concrete menagerie of beasts and figures; the sculptures range from the broad, whale-like contours of a frog’s face, to a cavalcade of dogs on mopeds, to a pair of skeletons partially embracing as if sitting for a double portrait. These images are interspersed with those of an older Thai couple mysteriously wandering around the temple like wraiths, the woman’s plodding progress hampered by the use of crutches.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cM9k2yzQcvI45ugQgL1NfxphM7r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65411,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kurimanzutto","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2014-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fireworks (Archives)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
