I used animation with poetic comment to analyze my emotions and vexations. I used pencil drawings in translucent frames to show a state of lightness.

I did so because our mental states are built from what we can see and what we remember or imagine in abstraction.”—Wojciech Bakowski","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Analysis of Emotions and Vexations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
