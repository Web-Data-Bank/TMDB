Traces/Legacy uses a device called a film recorder to print a series of still digital images onto 35mm film. The 35mm projector can only show a portion of the image at a time, so the viewer sees alterations between the top and bottom half of each frame. The images also overlap onto the optical sound area of the film, generating their own unique sounds.”—Scott Stark","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Traces/Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
