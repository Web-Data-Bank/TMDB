This theory used to upset Einstein. In his theory of relativity, no transmission of information could occur faster than the speed of light, therefore he couldn’t understand how the two particles could be simultaneously connected.”—Riccardo Giacconi","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entangled","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
