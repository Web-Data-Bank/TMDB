Long before the term \"fusion\" was coined, Lenny was melting musical boundaries to produce original pieces that borrowed from styles as diverse as jazz, classical and flamenco. Through a combination of never-before-seen archival footage and interviews with family and colleagues, viewers are offered a close-up look at a sensitive, selfless but flawed musical genius who redefined what the guitar could do.  - Telefilm Canada","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qmgnk29BwjHLJpOOFhD6su0EUgi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Genius of Lenny Breau","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
