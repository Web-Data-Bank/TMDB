The tribe looks forward to Tar and San's succession, for both are amiable and magnanimous to them; but since the chieftain's evil nephew Sabukot also stakes his claim on the throne, the Agatao chieftainship becomes a prize the claimants have to win. Adventuress Jessie and her team enter the scene, declaring Tar and San to be the long-estranged grandsons of rich philanthropist Gerardo Elizondo. Tar and San are taken to the city to learn the ways of the place they are meant to belong, but no matter how hard they try to adapt, the two cannot resist the call of the wild.","popularity":0.877,"poster_path":"/hdDKIPYY1CHw3rXoRz3axdiOPd7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4676,"logo_path":"/fu7gOKwS2l2fiFlEQFamITFEWDk.png","name":"Star Cinema â€“ ABS-CBN Film Productions","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1999-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tar-San","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
