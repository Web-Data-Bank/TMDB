Stefano Calvagna’s third feature is inspired by the real events in the life of Luciano Liboni, aka \"The Wolf.\" A freewheeling interpretation of the character, here renamed Franco Scattoni (Massimo Bonetti), the film highlights the ups and downs of a rough and violent man, whose behavior borders on madness and is worsened by epilepsy. Il Lupo feels he has nothing to loose. Diving headfirst into a life of crime, he ends up killing a gas station attendant in Perugia in 2002. He then kills a young \"carabiniere,\" and becomes a wanted fugitive. A case study in human behavior’s violent patterns framed as a psychological thriller and police story, this controversial film has been praised for the uncompromising realism of its disturbing narrative.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/49EvuU0YUDHOxKgeRddLDtQLHnC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poker Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2007-03-23","revenue":30033,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Lupo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
