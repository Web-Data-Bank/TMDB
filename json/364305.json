In this fictional tribute to Pasin's legacy, what begins as a small boy's over-scheduled, over supervised, boring day with Grandpa turns into a larger-than-life journey, narrowly escaping wild monkeys and battling aliens to save the universe. Through the power of imagination and epic adventure, a boy learns to be a kid, a father learns to be a dad, a grandpa reminds all of us what childhood is all about.","popularity":0.615,"poster_path":"/wMqhCsSSzByM1WuV7jkyvfhejYO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moonbot Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taking Flight","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":6}
