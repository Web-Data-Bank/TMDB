Far more than just an expose on the \"evils of rock-n-roll\", this powerful eight-part series uncovers the \"war of the worldviews\" - the epic struggle between good and evil, sin and redemption for the souls of men and the destiny of culture.  Covering a wide range of styles over almost a century of music, Hell's Bells 2 looks at hundreds of artists, videos, ideas and issues as it takes the viewer on a journey into the \"soul of rock-n-roll\". Fresh, vibrant, and wonderfully compelling, this is one documentary series that can illuminate as well as educate - change hearts as well as minds!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":370,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The power and spirit of pupular music","title":"Hell's Bells 2","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
