It was both true film notion and demonstrated an ingenious association with the film-process.  It is the procedure and conclusion of a piece  of film logic using a brilliantly simple device; the manipulation of the light source in the  Film Co-op printer such that a series of transformations are effected on a loop of film  material.  From the start Mike Leggett adopts a relational perspective according to which it is neither the elements or the emergent whole but the relations between the elements  (transformations) that become primary through the use of logical procedure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a9JEBc1gIN7dJv6xQesH2MqH0PY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shepherd’s Bush","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
