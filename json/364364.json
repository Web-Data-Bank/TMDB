An image on the borders of apprehension, becoming more and more abstract.  The surfer surfs, never surfs anywhere, an image suspended in the light of the projector lamp.  A very quiet and undramatic film, not particularly didactic.  Sound: the first four minutes consists of a fog-horn, used as the basic tone for a chord played on the organ, the rest of the film uses the sound of breakers with a two second pulse and occasional bursts of musical-like sounds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xoaDWu4OH5dlHeEyEY4Tq5xs7qf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1972-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silver Surfer","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
