One December evening a small car, barely the size of a shoebox, pulls up in front their house, and a teensy-weensy family gets out; it's the McTiny family. The family has become homeless after a road roller smashed their home. Planning to live with the girls temporarily, the family moves in with Jill and Joy but soon finds out that not all big people have good intentions towards them. Jill and Joy's Winter is based on a beloved book by the same name, written by a Finnish writer named Marjatta Kurenniemi.","popularity":1.404,"poster_path":"/pdM84qjEjOZFvXehjGcCqetGmI0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33392,"logo_path":"/fGssrRK2bkiH9TvgaSziBwmq42v.png","name":"Zodiak Finland","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2015-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jill and Joy's Winter","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":5}
