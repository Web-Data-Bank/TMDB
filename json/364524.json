Being a wonder child, a star of Yugoslavian cinematography, a sex symbol, and urban legend of the eighties generation, a fighter against establishment, Sonja Savić had always attracted attention. Simply put, she always looked, spoke and thought differently from others, she was entirely autonomous, an authentic phenomenon of Serbian culture. In the documentary SONJA, friends and colleagues of Sonja Savić testify on many aspects of her life and work, and a special emphasis is put on Sonja’s libertarian, rebellious, Don Quixote type of nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":65866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bastards Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2012-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sonja","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
