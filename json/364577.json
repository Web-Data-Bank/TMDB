Men who belonged to civic or veterans' clubs gathered together late at night while a \"roadshow operator\" would bring several hours worth of films and a 16mm projector. For a price, the audience would be treated to short films of gorgeous, naked women. These events were called \"stag parties.\" Films in this collection include a 1960s tattooed beauty and a creative use of stuffed animals. All of them showcase the types of luscious ladies who made the average working man a little happier to go home to their wife that night!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/MMTZvBwVjLgN2PX3OR5UElIPqa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alpha Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden Cinema: Volume 11 - Ultra Rare Blue","video":true,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
