We gain a sense of intimacy with them and nature. Suddenly we leave the worries of our scattered lives and begin to remember the primal elements of existence: earth, wind, fire, water, people, and creation. This epiphanic process demands patience and an almost meditative state, but it is so worth the effort â€“ just as a journey a mountain meadow requires some effort in order to find its treasures.  We leave the traditions of narrative for a more open approach to cinema. There are suggestions and onsets of a storyline, but almost everything remains a mystery for our encountering. This is a film that will allow you to observe and exist, without anxiety, without demands, and it allows you a rare glimpse into the life of things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n4zjAk93AcTyRFz1clXvS4tJjvG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136367,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Pilz Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":224,"logo_path":null,"name":"wega film vienna","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1990-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feldberg","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
