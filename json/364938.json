The film further  strengthens the reputation of veteran documentarian Schreiner, who's quietly and steadily established himself among Europe's most respected practitioners  of non-fiction cinema. But the film is by no means an example of an ‘auteur’  imposing his individual vision upon the world. Instead it's a remarkable example of intense collaboration between artist and subject, one so close  that such traditional distinctions and labels seem inappropriate.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/evL2ZqCYl1KKmT8GEoi3CENot7Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2006-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bellavista","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
