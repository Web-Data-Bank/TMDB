His use of colour through water and sky to convey his emotional state has had a great influence on me. Whether it was the first rays of light glinting the water's edge or the magic time just before nightfall, Monet's sense of colour and colour conveyance has always been perfect. I have used my techniques of alchemical film to translate onto film my impressions of Monet's sense of colour, water, sky and his most powerful icon the water lily. Using my toning, liquid emulsion, reticulation, dried crystal bleach formations and stacking techniques to just name a few I have translated the Monet experience onto the surface of my film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eNivSm7hG0zwqxZLt1LjbgCXVYo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Monet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
