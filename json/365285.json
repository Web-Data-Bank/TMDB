The Weird Girls - “an extraordinary art event for ordinary girls” - is a one day performance, but actresses are not allowed.  From it’s conception seven years ago by Kitty Von Sometime, The Weird Girls Project has quickly become a national phenomenon in Iceland and every episode is covered by the national TV and print media. Between a pop event and feminist activism, performance art and a goliardic action, the project gives voice and space to woman to freely express themselves in a fabulous and unique carnival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4HrxiZzUbnMQhxDMqXEQgp2OZEs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2015-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An extraordinary art event for ordinary girls","title":"I Want to Be Weird","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
