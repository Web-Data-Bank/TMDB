Notable facts and characters of his songs takes us through the story, a portrait of São Paulo city in the 50's, a place full of music, love stories and gentrification (poor people getting evicted from their places in order to build great buildings), subjects often explored in Adoniran's work, always with a good touch of humor. This way he became the 'poor people poet'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4u0daODBddHPt3hGHkREPFTgaIn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66416,"logo_path":"/bWSK7vS3AQI3JAakfmVysr1ag7I.png","name":"Latina Estúdio","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2015-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dá Licença de Contar","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4}
