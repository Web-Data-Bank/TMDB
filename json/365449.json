Running became his medicine, and that outlet grew into a community where people support and encourage the success of others. Inspired by a Spanish professor's groundbreaking scientific study proving that drinking a beer after a run can hydrate the body better than water, David founded the 'Fishtown Beer Runners.' The Philadelphia based club runs five to ten kilometers every week, ending up at a different bar, where they have a couple of beers and toast to 'The Professor.' David's journey has not only helped others turn their lives around, it has influenced an international beer running movement in Spain, promoting responsible consumption and exercise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beer Runners","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
