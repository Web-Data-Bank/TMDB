However, I ended up doing a feature film with many links to documentary. I wanted to know what made Brazilians want to emigrate to Portugal. I chose working with amateur actors and non-actors in both cities, so their own life stories and experiences could be in the film. I did the other way round from the writer. He found these people and made them characters of his book. I looked for people who had similar stories to those described in the book, and made them characters of my film. When I read the book, I was seduced by its \"false documentary\" characteristic. The book was all written as if it was the transcription of an oral interview the writer had done in Lisbon. I decided to keep this narrative in the film, by a narration with the main character talking to the camera. It's a film about emigration. About dreams and disappointments,\" says Barahona","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wXXbuTFF9KKB4kiXFFYXhQbtTba.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16582,"logo_path":null,"name":"David \u0026 Golias","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":125568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mutuca Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":101884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Refinaria Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2015-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Estive em Lisboa e Lembrei de Você","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
