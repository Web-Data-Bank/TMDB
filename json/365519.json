Simultaneously Nesher documented with his cinematographer David Gurfinkel the Russian-Israeli belly dancer Elina Pechersky during her preparations for an ambitious performance together with five Palestinian-Israeli musicians. Nesher weaves the two strands into one cinematic narrative, juxtaposing history and mythology, reality and imagination, questioning the unbearable communication failure between the \"major\" and the \"minor\" conflicts between Palestinian and Israeli cultures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oriental","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
