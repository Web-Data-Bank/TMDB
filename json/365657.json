It is about a rescue of Catherine's lover, whom she saves by posing him as her brother. This story, as a parable, flies throughout Ukraine's history and reconstructs its dramatic and heroic episodes. Every challenge, including the Chernobyl accident, leaves Catherine without her home.  But she is stubborn, as many generations of Ukrainians, in rebuilding her house out of pieces. The story is not only about Catherine's redemption, but also about Ukraine's survival throughout the centuries that is reflected in a folk tradition called Toloka.","popularity":0.784,"poster_path":"/fjyZKC3m1dZPeQzG8U7soDqIt3F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illienko Film","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toloka","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
