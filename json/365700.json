Instead, it presents 20 different short films (back-to-back) on the general theme of Danish women, directed by filmmakers including Krzysztof Zanussi, Monika Treut, Gustav Hamos, David Blair, Vibeke Vogel, Dusan Makavejev, Morten Skallerud and Lars Norgaard. Some dramatic vignettes mix with other comedic ones, but all are offbeat and experimental. The picture includes one animated sequence (by Norgaard).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7ePEYGyzOoYYkHdjS4YT7cvaKIP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42263,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marianna Films","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":1052,"logo_path":null,"name":"Darkfibre Entertainment Ltd.","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":93651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Holland House","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Danish Girls Show Everything","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
