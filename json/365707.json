Created by Rory O'Neill, Panti is also an accidental activist and in her own words 'a court jester, whose duty is to say the un-sayable'. Over the last few years Rory has become a figurehead for LGBT rights in Ireland and since the recent scandal around Pantigate, his fight for equality and against homophobia has been recognised all around the world.","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":"/usbWqVpj9NEZccs414rvQK3Jq7Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9225,"logo_path":"/7P0jOFlckSJ2HRijCcP8IspQc37.png","name":"Blinder Films","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2015-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen of Ireland","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":7}
