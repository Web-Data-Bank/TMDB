Those who know Attell's misanthropic stage persona from his series won't be disappointed by his material here, though he functions mainly as host for his three co-headliners. Rouse takes the easy route with jokes aimed straight for the heart of the rowdy audience (sex, booze, drugs), Giraldo mixes gags based around fatherhood with some political humor, while Cook, whose status has blossomed to near-superstardom thanks to tours like this, is broad and fairly foul-mouthed, but gives an engagingly manic performance, which is well received by the heavily lubricated twenty-something crowd.","popularity":0.697,"poster_path":"/4EXnMe1daIgpO9VC15qwcmkRw2h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dave Attell's Insomniac Tour: Uncensored!","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
