After the fall of the Soviet Union, Alex's personal fortune was confiscated by the Uzbek government. Alex now runs a small 24-hour restaurant, \"Tashkent\", in Ansan, South Korea. Alex’s story brings forth a more complex history of mobility and migration across Asia - the story of the survival and revival of Soviet Koreans over the last 150 years. They came to South Korea, for better opportunities, but life isn’t much easier here either. Through the life of Alex KIM, a 3rd generation Korean running a restaurant in Ddet gol village, Ansan, the director brings the issues of the Korean diaspora to our attention.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart of Snow, Heart of Blood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
