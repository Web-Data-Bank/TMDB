Inspired by the dusty days of VHS, LAKE NOWHERE is preceded by original trailers &amp; commercials, replicating the experience of watching a long lost bootleg tape. When a group of friends arrive at a desolate lakeside cabin, they are stalked and murdered by a Masked Maniac, whose lust for blood transcends our world. This age-old tale of senseless slaughter quickly spirals into the realm of supernatural horror and classic monster movies, as we learn the true power that lies within LAKE NOWHERE.","popularity":2.148,"poster_path":"/uwCiR4G10XqaeK52MezZHlEEKXi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67086,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ursidae Parade","origin_country":""},{"id":67087,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Ravacon Collective","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You Won't get Out Alive!","title":"Lake Nowhere","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":11}
