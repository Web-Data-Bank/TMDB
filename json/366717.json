Sir Howard Morrison (as himself) and Rotorua are the stars in the tiki-flavoured tale. Moving from Sydney to a Rotorua music festival the plot centres on a romance between a young drummer (Gary Wallace) and his girl Judy (Carmen Duncan) and the hurdles they face to stay true. But this is only an excuse for a melange of madcap, pep-filled musical fun. Made by John O’Shea’s Pacific Films, it features Kiri Te Kanawa, Lew Pryme and Aussie star Norman Rowe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2zgz8mi5UG6eyYvTcI8UFG1bPw2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pacific Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1966-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Let It Get You","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
