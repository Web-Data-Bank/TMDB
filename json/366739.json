Claire is hostile to most people but manipulative and sweet to her pain management doctor who prescribes her the pain medication she needs to survive. Claire's husband, Jason, has finally left her, but she's assisted by her devoted housekeeper, Silvana, who has become both caretaker and chauffeur and who selflessly looks after all of Claire's needs. Because of the accident, Claire refuses to sit up in the car, and lies down while being driven everywhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g5nqwnmZz1FE8k4oAqS7tKQmX5w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Awesome Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2013-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every moral has a price, as long as the price is right.","title":"Cake","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
