A young enemployed, unskilled worker walks through the streets of Copenhagen, sustaining himself partly on the dole and free soup-kitchen meals and partly on day-dreams. He spends time at a cemetry studying headstone inscriptions. Mild-mannered and of poetic bent, he understands little of an intellectual friend's advice and shies away from the love of a woman who shares her bed with him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fZaiODGc1fqDoUIdoFVJrNfM3Lu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dagmar Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1978-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Did Somebody Laugh?","video":false,"vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":5}
