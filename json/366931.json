When he leaves to New York, she cannot bear what has been left for her. Even though the return seemed unthinkable, she goes back to the North. The burden of failure and the crossing of a legendary river, lead her to an ancient tale: once you cross the river of forgetfulness, your own past will also be forgotten. Alex returns while she is searching for a new setting for herself. He no longer believes in this country. She has gotten closer to the place where everything has started for her. He will leave. She will not return.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yh7gGHTVgt4bkssJsDFryCG73P9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9047,"logo_path":"/a0oCybecb96ieZY4139hb9uqYs1.png","name":"Terratreme","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2015-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Girl of Her Age","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
