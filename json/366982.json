Thanks to a combination of outdated technology, a worn and possibly oft-copied videotape, and the perfectly imperfect shadows and sunspots that only nature can provide, the footage is unintentionally, unbearably poignant: a surviving materialization of the blurred memory of lost youth, still tangible but beginning to erode, and all the more beautiful for its apparent fragility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Holidaymakers: A Film about The Clientele","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
