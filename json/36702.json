The last film in the series, Cremaster 5 represents the moment when the testicles are finally released and sexual differentiation is fully attained. The lamenting tone of the opera suggests that Barney invisions this as a moment of tragedy and loss. The primary character is the Queen of Chain (played by Ursula Andress). Barney, himself, plays three characters who appear in the mind of the Queen: her Diva, Magician, and Giant. The Magician is a stand-in for Harry Houdini, who was born in Budapest in 1874 and appears as a recurring character in the Cremaster cycle.","popularity":1.235,"poster_path":"/cugY47OHyyg6Wuq0UuEmeJ9KZkA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cremaster 5","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":19}
