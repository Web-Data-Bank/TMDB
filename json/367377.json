As they have the same blood type, her rapist asks her to donate blood for his operation claiming this will lengthen his life and will give him ample time to seek redemption. The woman refuses to do so as she rediscovers she is still a victim of unrequited love towards her rapist. Told in two separate perspectives, the story revolves around how the woman and man pick the pieces of their broken lives after the rape, meeting every so often at places that remind them of their past. They are confronted by the fact that they are both victims of each other: THE WOMAN struggles with loving no one but the man; THE MAN, struggles with his guilt knowing he can't love the woman the way she wants him to.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":66494,"logo_path":null,"name":"Outpost Visual Frontier","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":67461,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Grit Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2011-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Natural Phenomenon Of Madness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
