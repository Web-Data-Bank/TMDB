They reach the point where they can't go on. Escalating pressures force them to hatch a wild get-rich-quick scheme in a last ditch attempt to solve \"all of their problems\". The far-fetched scheme involves one of them being bitten by a rat in a major supermarket with the fantastical hopes of winning an outrageously huge settlement. What transpires is a perfect example of \"the best laid plans of mice and men\" where reality trumps delusion and, in one comic turn after another, depravity gives way to humanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rat thing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
