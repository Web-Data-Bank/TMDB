The sight of a beautiful call girl stirs a ripple in his stagnant heart, and he becomes determined to win her love -- and lose his virginity along the way. But, more than just sex, he wants love and understanding. Between his minister father and drug-dealing friends, the only person who really seems to empathize with him isn't the call girl, but her transvestite brother. Unfortunately for Chris/Crystal, Sam doesn't want her affection and so the nightmare begins as a random act of violence towards her sets off a chain of events. From the salvation of a killing bully, to an awkward encounter with a virgin suffering an epileptic sleep disorder, to a transvestite's reunion with a past she left behind as a reckless man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":25886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Outpost Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Ripple in the World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
