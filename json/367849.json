The dictatorship in the country is followed by democracy, but the bright light of it blinds Fermin: he is displaced. At the police station, his anonymity is complete and he doesn't remember his own name. He is fitted with a past of 13 years of illegal political opposition from the police archives. When he keeps silent about the crimes of the dictator regime, he will be a free man. The woman he promised to marry, doesn't recognize him anymore, and thinks he is dead.","popularity":0.92,"poster_path":"/rgIfJm0qhT4J2u1lhtVOLSY2XyT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allarts Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1989-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":7}
