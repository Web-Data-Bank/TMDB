[...] One of the subjects that Lauste briefly filmed was children on the island of Marken. We see the children passing by in a rowboat, and dancing in a circle. The traditional costumes and the watery environment looked very exotic to foreign audiences. The footage jibed very well with the perceptions that people had of the Netherlands in those days.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6XU068X81ArRSACeuKVnKZDxMZp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nederlandsche Biograaf en Mutoscope Maatschappij","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1899-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island of Marken","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
