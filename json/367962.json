In a community deep with tradition, where female genital mutilation (FGM) is still a rite of passage, these young Maasai express their frustrations at inequality by smacking cricket balls on the plains of Kenya and dreaming of life beyond their own village. Thus begins a journey all the way to England; the home of cricket. It is a journey which gives the Warriors the courage to face their elders in the hope of ending FGM.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/hB2aarW2unO4ARh2ByaCP4QTpgR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warriors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
