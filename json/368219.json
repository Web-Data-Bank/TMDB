Now it's believed that he sought out sanctuary in the house of a man (Hughes), and that the man threw him out. And it's also believed that the boy being Hispanic was probably part of a gang and that the whole thing was gang related, so the police don't consider any need to investigate the incident. But a teacher (Kelly) doesn't believe this, and sets out to find out what happened that night by talking to the man, but he doesn't want to talk about it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7RL779RegWnpGRPQVlya1diiWI7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97056,"logo_path":null,"name":"Herbert Brodkin Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":149153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theater Center","origin_country":""},{"id":15131,"logo_path":null,"name":"Titus Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night of Courage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
