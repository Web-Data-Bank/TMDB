Performed in its entirety, the oratorio provides a narrative of Christ’s nativity, passion and resurrection juxtaposed against images of absurdities and abuses against the human species across the world. The film reveals a wide array of worshippers from the Bodybuilders of Christ to the Lavender Light Gay and Lesbian Interracial Choir to the Dallas police choir.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/hfyYXDn8xd8nyKyv1v37GTci7rX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55216,"logo_path":"/pyDDOSzQdVQU5F69qBOgtCn8q9J.png","name":"Kuiv Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Messiah","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
