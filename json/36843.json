Wendy clerks in a shop, leads aerobics at a primary school, jokes like a vaudevillian, agrees to waitress at a friend's new restaurant and dotes on Andy, a cook who forever puts off home remodeling projects, and with a drunken friend, buys a broken down lunch wagon. Natalie, with short neat hair and a snappy, droll manner, is a plumber; she has a holiday planned in America, but little else. Last is Nicola, odd man out: a snarl, big glasses, cigarette, mussed hair, jittery fingers, bulimic, jobless, and unhappy. How they interact and play out family conflict and love is the film's subject.","popularity":5.989,"poster_path":"/zdkKNQzzwyciP9vAohAPFZdujlA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9210,"logo_path":"/ruUf9qymJ1gKLmerDKO8pgq1CYM.png","name":"Film Four International","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":10100,"logo_path":"/nmx8lrRBeXk5ZLnUKazDUx4PYVf.png","name":"Thin Man Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-11-15","revenue":1500000,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Is Sweet","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":136}
