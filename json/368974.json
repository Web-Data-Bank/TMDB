Explosions. A woman and a man meet. And they lose sight of each other again after spending a night in a hotel room. Surrounded by a desolate and polluted universe where night never seems to end, these lonely souls are on their cynical quest for a lost world. But in the longed-for, world there cannot be any reality. In the other one, which is existing, life has ended. It needs to cross the wasteland and go beyond the horizon to find the starting point of something new.","popularity":1.12,"poster_path":"/iqAr0eR6tiyLgsry45ibtHJM3y1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":41751,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poco FIlms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kalyi: Age of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
