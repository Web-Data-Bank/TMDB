Fifty years later acclaimed filmmaker Emiko Omori asks her older sister and other detainees to reflect on the personal and political consequences of internment. From the exuberant recollections of a typical teenager, to the simmering rage of citizens forced to sign loyalty oaths, Omori renders a poetic and illuminating picture of a deeply troubling chapter in American history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":68057,"logo_path":null,"name":"wabi-sabi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rabbit in the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
