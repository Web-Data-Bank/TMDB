In this season of Villmarksbarna we get to be with Runa (9), her siblings Narve (5), Ida (12), and Guro (15), and her parents Inger and Lars on many new experiences. They leave for a summer ski-trip, an alternative 17'th of may celebration on a beach far from the city, on a glacier -trip and they help with tagging of reindeer calves. They build nesting boxes that they set out early in the spring and we get to participate in an adventurous trip to Alaska where we meet both mountain sheep, chipmunks and maybe also a grizzly bear?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2skJC7zHcPA8m5b7irJI3zWujtZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Villmarksbarna 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
