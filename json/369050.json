The young man has to learn again how to eat, walk, wash himself, do simple housework, and even how to look out of the window without seeing anything. All connections to his previous life are broken. In this new life blind Zuev encounters an exceptional woman capable of seeing more than other people. Her name sounds symbolic – Nadezhda (translates as 'hope' into English) and she works at the local hospital. Nadezhda will help Zuev find his strength and a new sense of existing. These equally strong but otherwise different people spend together what, perhaps, will be the best days of their lives; but everything has an ending.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ql97s7Np9KQ9LoEAIAvh8CCM8Uj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Пан-Атлантик Студио","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insight","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
