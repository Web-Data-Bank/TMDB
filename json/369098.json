But after 20 years of living on display and constantly being photographed in a tourist village in Thailand, the rings are becoming more a trap than a source of pride. When a chance meeting with an Australian filmmaker puts a video camera in her hands, she decides to turn the lens around and make a film about what it means to live in a ‘human zoo’. The process turns her life on its head and forces her to choose between tradition and rebellion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2013-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I want to show people the truth about having a long neck","title":"My long neck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
