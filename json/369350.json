Numerous artists speak of their conceptions of the underground as a movement, a way of perceiving reality, a way of social engagement, and even a way of living. The specific socio-historical condition in the '90s resulted in intensive artistic activity as a response to the totalitarian regime.  This film is a collection of the personal experiences of artists who were involved in the underground scene since the '90s until the first decade of the new millennium.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94038,"logo_path":null,"name":"trayectos.org","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(On the Quest for) Belgrade Underground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
