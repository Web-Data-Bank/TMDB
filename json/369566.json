She recognizes the woman who gave her life and lost her husband and sons due to the war, but cannot call her mother. Meetings on the collective farm with interesting people make Tanya think a lot and experience a lot.  She discovers for herself a completely new, largely alien world to her. It does not immediately penetrate the sense of inner kinship with this world, its people, so unusual for her.","popularity":1.334,"poster_path":"/iOVUB2KwUaDcSIRSEMeF3RqM9Oc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21978,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1959-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Home for Tanya","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
