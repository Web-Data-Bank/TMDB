Of course, with this comes the added novelty of having money for the first time and Kevin shares his views on that, as well as musing on politics, and the ever-topical Scottish referendum. The razor sharp wit on show here proves he is one of the UK’s brightest young talents and really makes this the DVD for any comedy fan this Christmas.","popularity":0.924,"poster_path":"/45zDP2grqN99yRjzGgxny12OnLK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Pictures UK","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live In Glasgow","title":"Kevin Bridges Live: A Whole Different Story","video":true,"vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":9}
