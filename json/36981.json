He dupes Vivian into bringing it to the Pentagon to exact his final revenge on the government, rigging it so it will explode before its count-down if Vivian's pacemaker isn't within fifteen feet of it. Medusa arms itself in the air aboard Scott Nash's 737 cargo plane, and with Hurricane Sigrid about to hit the coast, nobody wants to let them land. Based on the novel by John J.
