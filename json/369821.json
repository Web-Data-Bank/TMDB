It is time to return to the itinerant path from which all things in their uncommon lives come; beginning and ending on a remote dot in the Pacific. They nomadically trace continents to places where waves meet their edges, envoys of aloha. It is what they will learn, what they bring others, what they will pass on to their children in the hyper-expanded classroom, the lab of direct being; a legacy passed from a father to his family.","popularity":2.764,"poster_path":"/jsrX650umhno3p2j9nvUlAP4F0Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avocados \u0026 Coconuts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Given","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":28}
