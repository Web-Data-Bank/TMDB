Now and then the phone rings and shortly thereafter a visitor arrives; the old man dutifully prepares rice cakes for them. The cakes are the last meal these visitors will eat before embarking on the seemingly long journey to the next world. The first to arrive is an angler, then a rat, and the last a teacher and two students.","popularity":0.957,"poster_path":"/iKACdb9Hyso9qRZTgpp15XzC6Hr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jinjin Pictures","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":199280,"logo_path":null,"name":"Japari Film","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2018-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eyelids","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
