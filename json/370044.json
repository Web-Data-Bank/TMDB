Stuart Blackton was intrigued by the idea of a film about the history of the movies as early as 1915. He finally released a 52-minute feature called The Film Parade that was shown in New York and favorably reviewed by \"Variety\" in 1933. He continued tinkering with the film for the rest of the decade, and later filmmakers and distributors used Blackton's footage for stock or to produce their own variously titled and truncated versions.  -UCLA Film & Television Archive","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2514,"logo_path":"/zEyrFF8Nn325PXG0Q9j7my0JqIJ.png","name":"Alliance Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1933-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Film Parade","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
