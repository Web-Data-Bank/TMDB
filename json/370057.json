Depicting the resignation and nihilism of the postwar generation in the years following the Anpo Treaty conflicts through a coming-of-age narrative, Yamagiwa offers sharp criticism of the prevalent characterizations of Japan's new youth offered by Nikkatsu's taiyozoku (“Sun Tribe”) films and the New Wave at large.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lkrjih3ON0BJANJbNMZj5Hc1mFk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sagawa Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1961-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
