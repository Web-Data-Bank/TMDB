In front of the camera were Christallo Parmakis and Bob Di Matteo. At this time I worked with images and narrative in, one could say, a musical way – in the sense that we did not use a previously set script. What interested me was what the film itself needed, going from one scene to the next, the imagery and what could be achieved with that landscape and the combination of those two people. This way of working involved editing in the camera, hard work and dedication.
