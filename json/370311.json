States McCarthy: \"[The piece] is a reference to art now, to a resurgence of the 1970s and an interest in youth in the art world. There are also references to Hollywood 8 movies and soft porn made in the Hollywood hills... In Fresh Acconci, the New York art scene is sandwiched with Hollywood. Two kinds of aesthetics overlap. The tape itself crosses lines of what is politically correct, exploitation and softening or obscuring the meaning.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/psVzg6jWFJJn9AStVi9YlMZjgFh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fresh Acconci","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
