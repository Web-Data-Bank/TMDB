It presents a seemingly desultory time period to tell the story of two generations. A young girl who’s confused about what lies ahead is sent to England to receive education from childhood. She indulges herself in cyberlove and cannot get herself out of the hurtful affair. A middle-aged father who’s perplexed about death left his hometown for Beijing when he was young. He feels helpless about the status quo of the state-owned film studio. Tortured by terminal disease, he gives up the hope to live on.","popularity":0.906,"poster_path":"/mRsWJKscbMUfcjGOstCJBjMksJR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85736,"logo_path":null,"name":"China Movie Channel (CMC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2015-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Simple Goodbye","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
