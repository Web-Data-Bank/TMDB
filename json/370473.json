In this version, instead of a web of lies and agendas, we get a web of desires, perversions like incest, and occult phenomenon like an oracle-demon, hallucinations, and human sacrifice. Once again, the story starts with a detective trying to unravel the story of a man and a woman encountering a bandit-rapist in the woods, but the real story keeps turning out to be unfathomable as layer upon layer of strange motives and events keep turning up.","popularity":0.966,"poster_path":"/sO8F097mu94TsJYG7FJr5r5fyDM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Image Factory IM Co.
