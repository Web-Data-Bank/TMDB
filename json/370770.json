My teacher taught me all these things about evolution and eventually, I accepted them. Then in June, I saw the YouTube video of “100 Reasons Why Evolution is SO Stupid!” I watched that and realized that nearly everything my teacher had taught me was disproved lies. It was so entertaining as well as informative and educational, that I stayed up nearly all night watching more videos. You got me to realize that Genesis is true! I can EVER repay you for saving me! When we see each other in Heaven, I will be standing along with the hundreds of thousands of people you won to Christ! I myself have already won a friend to Christ with your material! I want to save more people. God bless you!–Eric June 2013","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creation Science Evangelism","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Reasons Why Evolution Is Stupid","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
