While prior to the Crusades different groups coexisted more or less peacefully, the trauma of the European invasions shaped today's familiar dichotomies—East and West, Christianity and Islam, Shi’ism and Sunni’ism. At first sight a history lesson for children, the project ultimately raises important questions about the historicity of identity and consequently the role of history itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cabaret Crusades Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
