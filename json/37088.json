Interviewing an increasingly mentally unstable Wuornos, Broomfield captures the distorted mind of a murderer whom the state of Florida deems of sound mind -- and therefore fit to execute. Throughout the film, Broomfield includes footage of his testimony at Wuornos' trial.","popularity":5.782,"poster_path":"/a77VTxHWxuraYUPlvdSG2idI0Dj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lafayette Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The 2002 Interviews.","title":"Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer","video":false,"vote_average":6.809,"vote_count":109}
