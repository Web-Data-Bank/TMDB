Who are these gorgeous young women from the big city strolling on the village square under the watchful eye of a chaperone as beautiful as she is authoritarian? Scandal arises when it’s learned these dreamy creatures are none other than the employees of a Marseille brothel come to enjoy the good clean air of the country. All hell breaks loose as the villagers take a stand for or against the presence of these \"ladies of pleasure\". The mayor is called on to relay women of the moral rules of the region to the women. But the fact remains, they can’t be forced to leave: while they have no intention of plying their trade, no law exists to bring their country retreat to a premature end.  Different mentalities are revealed, passions unbridled, love kindled... and doesn’t love always solve everything in the end?","popularity":0.986,"poster_path":"/dTujiotFpz7lqIxX661NfL3oSVC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6849,"logo_path":"/AjdOGHRLAhWbP1aAga85A9EOfD2.png","name":"SFP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flach Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cocottes","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
