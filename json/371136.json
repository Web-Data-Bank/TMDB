But the blockbuster comedy writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel has been making television and film audiences laugh for decades. In the early '70s, Ganz was writing for The Odd Couple while Mandel was receiving his first paychecks for work on M*A*S*H and Busting Loose.  In total, Ganz and Mandel have written an astonishing 18 produced feature screenplays, including City Slickers, A League of Their Own, Mr. Saturday Night, Forget Paris, Where the Heart Is, Robots, and Fever Pitch, while also maintaining a \"secret career\" of un-credited rewrites on studio comedies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sKdZZ8lK9M2NT0EJwRATuGDnIbk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An interview series that gives unprecedented looks into the lives of working screenwriters.","title":"The Dialogue: An Interview with Screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
