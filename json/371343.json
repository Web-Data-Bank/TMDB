K (section a)","overview":"The video revolves around an unending \"meeting\" - a busy, aimless meeting that goes in circles to evade a traditional narrative arc. The meeting is essentially a party, and the entire company bumps and grinds with itself everywhere from in boardrooms to airplanes. K-Corea INC. K processes ideas of automation and containment, embodied by these hyper-controlled locations and by the seemingly looping actions that take place in them. Meetings, where discrete parts of a corporate body come together to attempt to \"get on the same page,\" display the futility of corporate unity, and of individual purpose or voice remaining intact within a corporate culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3Z7iYyCDLESDIe2uHx9xhiFskMh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K-CoreaINC.
