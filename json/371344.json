The director plays four sisters named Ceader, Britt, Adobe and Deno, the boundaries of whom are indistinct. It is difficult to tell where one sister ends and the next begins.  The sisters' questing—for identity, for romance, etc.—leads them on an episodic series of adventures, several of which are defined as \"premises.\" A Trecartin premise plays out as a predetermined situation where the character initiating it has already set the tone, terms, and trajectory of the experience in their mind. The actual, lived event serves only as the shading-in of the outline.","popularity":0.988,"poster_path":"/y0vQ61gWqDmE5bavRQcUR5akxmb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sibling Topics (Section A)","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
