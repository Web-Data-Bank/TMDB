This year, the musicians released their first studio album in 9 years, titled Toto XIV. However, the group had already resumed touring for a few years. The albums Toto and Toto IV, and the single Rosanna won six Grammy Awards. In 1982, the groupâ€™s flagship year, Rosanna came second in the US charts and Africa even took first place. Their hits continue to air regularly on the radio and are still popular with the public. Guitarist and singer Steve Lukather is the only Toto member present since the band's inception. He is surrounded by 13 permanent musicians and 31 others recruited specifically for the tours. During the 2015 edition of Baloise, Toto, at his best, performed classics such as Hold The Line, Rosanna or Africa, but also extracts from his new album.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/90wkGufCc7NYdKXxLWE0TaxzrL0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2015-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toto - Baloise Sessions","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
