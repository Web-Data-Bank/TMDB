Over the course of her career, she revolutionized modern dance, generated what later became known as performance art, and changed the basic tenets of experimental filmmaking - all during a time when women were largely ignored in the art world. Today she continues to push forward, creating vibrant, courageous, unpredictable work, inspiring a new generation of artists to question, overthrow, and generate possibilities of their own. Feelings Are Facts: The Life of Yvonne Rainer is the story of this remarkable artist and the equally remarkable times that shaped her creative practice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cRDpvqpnjIRHlf3kmco2yvbyj0a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feelings Are Facts: The Life of Yvonne Rainer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
