Iryna miraculously survived after an accident. Facing death changed her forever. From time to time, Iryna started to see visions. They were short fragments episodes, fragmentary images. She couldn't understand it, and how does this relate to her. Over time, she learned to analyze what is happening in her head, and it started to bear fruit. Iryna began to solve the crime scenes. This is a story that is dangerously balancing on the edge of life and death, reality and dreaming, white lie and killing truth.
