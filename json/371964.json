In addition to magical concert moments (both acoustic and electric), we get to meet the band in the tour bus, at sound check and at Youngstorget, Oslo during the demonstration against the war in Iraq. The film has very strong emotions and gives a very good insight into what it's like to experience this band live.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kCWSFHRRbDeZruEJOqg2vgIMp08.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69719,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Music Norway","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bigbang: Radio Radio TV Sleep","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
