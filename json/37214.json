We follow the training of a platoon under the rueful command of Lt. Mike Grayson who shares common prejudices of the time. The 442nd serve in Italy, then France, distinguishing themselves in skirmishes and battles; gradually and naturally, Grayson's prejudices evaporate with dawning realization that his men are better soldiers than he is.","popularity":1.355,"poster_path":"/1GPB0qO9GJ9HYDGXwPBX20jgInJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of Japanese-American soldiers who fought in Europe during World War II","title":"Go for Broke!","video":false,"vote_average":5.763,"vote_count":20}
