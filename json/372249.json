The party’s great success is generally regarded as a result of its leader’s demonic charisma. But this film doesn’t focus on Jörg Haider. Instead it gives a face to the people who make Haider’s election victories possible, taking a clear stance, yet refraining from commentary or judgement. It is up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oYfS14tdgNLVdU5Dw5RjWG6HItM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allegro Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1993-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Election Campaigners","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
