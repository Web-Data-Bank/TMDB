At Chalvet, in the north of Martinique, one hundred laborers on strike are sprayed with tear gas, surrounded by fourteen trucks of mobile guards, grounded by a helicopter shooting at sight. The versions differ and are discussed. This strike is suspected of being led by leftists, who, usurping the place of the unions, are treating the economic and political stability by manipulating the peasantry. One dead, four seriously wounded by gunfire and dozens injured put an end of the story of the strike.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chalvet, la conquête de la dignité","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
