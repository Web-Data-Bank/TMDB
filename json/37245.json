Laurent loves his roommate Dan, who's straight and a playboy. Laurent can't bring himself to tell Dan, but is content to share a flat and to party with him. Then Camille comes along, Dan falls hard, and Laurent is beside himself: he tries to sabotage the relationship, but each effort backfires. After Dan moves in with Camille, Laurent enlists the help of Sam, his new lesbian flatmate, and Nick, a long-time gay friend. As the lovers head toward marriage, Laurent becomes more desperate. His efforts may be having an effect, if not on Dan, then on Camille.
