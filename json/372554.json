The period of mourning comes to an end at a temple-like funeral chapel. The final visitors are not mourners, but want to buy off their guilt. The mother wants to see a real confession. And money.  The intense emotionality the death of a child evokes is, as it were, sculpted in space while the tension between the mother and the visitors is captured more subliminally by a roving camera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2012-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
