After spending a few days cementing the good image of Santa Claus, their generosity became increasingly radical. Among other things, the Santas climbed a barbed wire fence surrounding the recently shutte red General Motors assembly plant with the purpose of giving jobs back to “their rightful owners.”  The week-long performance reached its crescendo inside one of Copenhagen’s biggest department stores when the Santas started handing out presents to customers directly off the shelves.  The performance exposed the radical implications of the myth of Santa Claus’ boundless generosity, demonstrating that true generosity is impossible within the narrow terms of capitalist society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/44Mi4kRNcGfet5hb3chKILPZUMQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solvognen","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1975-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lovely Is the Blue Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
