Along with his business partner Eric Glomski, Keenan has managed to transform an arid stretch of Arizona desert into a lush vineyard that yields some particularly tasty grapes. Through unguarded conversations with Keenan and Glomski, Pomerenke and Page discover just what got the pair interested in winemaking, and why they chose such a hostile natural environment to serve as the site of their winery.","popularity":2.803,"poster_path":"/frbuHxu3vkoykAJvwDbjAuOSBZY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6000,"logo_path":null,"name":"SemiRebellious Films","origin_country":""},{"id":6001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Twinkle Cash Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Into Wine","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":18}
