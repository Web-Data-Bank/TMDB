From their dominating defense to their swaggering offense and their firebrand of a head coach, the Bears of that vintage team were a force to be reckoned with, and itâ€™s easy to see why their legacy has remained strong. Big personalities like Mike Ditka and Jim McMahon, combined with the ferocious attitudes of players like Mike Singletary and Steve McMichael made for a volatile mix that ended up carrying the Bears to a 15-1 record and to an emphatic victory in Super Bowl XX.","popularity":2.267,"poster_path":"/kvaDvizAOlQpyvc5HBiN2jwOO8W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The '85 Bears","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":13}
