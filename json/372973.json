This was a swan song of sorts for the band, at least from a live performance standpoint and at least for a while if not forever, and it seems that the boys wanted to go \"out\" on a high note of excitement. Mick is in a lather from virtually the get go here, strutting and posing in his inimitable way through a set that draws largely but not exclusively on the then recent Tattoo You.","popularity":0.607,"poster_path":"/uvMjLlzjy1vzBP0B21APAptAsar.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rolling Stones - From the Vault - Live in Leeds 1982","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
