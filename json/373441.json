Foley wore an orange jumpsuit as he knelt beside an ISIS militant dressed in black. That image challenged the world to deal with a new face of terror. And it tested one American family.  Seen through the lens of filmmaker Brian Oakes, Foleyâ€™s close childhood friend, Jim takes us from small-town New England to the adrenaline-fueled front lines of Libya and Syria, where Foley pushed the limits of danger to report on the plight of civilians impacted by war.","popularity":3.016,"poster_path":"/ng7aABnVoUp9dUHv92E3Uo5nqul.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72946,"logo_path":"/bnK0eEBYKv7bf5m030ID30IoHRE.png","name":"Kunhardt Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jim: The James Foley Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":33}
