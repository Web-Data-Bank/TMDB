Nariman needs young recruits for his flying school—a goal made darkly comic since he just survived a plane crash—while the illustrious Helly collects Kalashnikov rifles and a sea of Kurdish flags to produce her music video. In the midst of another war against the Kurdish people, Nariman reminisces about a long-lost love, and Helly finds herself connecting with Kurdish children at a refugee camp near the Syrian border, who are in urgent need of inspiration and hope.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":"/iYA3qn5yGadBsQcac7GNC9PhfMZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2440,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mij Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"}],"release_date":"2015-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Flag Without a Country","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
