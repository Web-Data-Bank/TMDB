Monte has a long-term relationship with prostitute Martine Bernard, while Chet has fallen under the spell of the widow who owns the hardware store. Camaraderie and competition with the other cowboys fill their days, until one of the hands, Shorty Austin, loses his job and gets involved in rustling and killing. Then Monte and Chet find that their lives on the range are inexorably redirected.","popularity":9.208,"poster_path":"/5zQ4b28cAvV8sUNl40kBq6relH6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brandman Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":12014,"logo_path":null,"name":"TWS Productions II","origin_country":""},{"id":678,"logo_path":"/AbIc38dGx4b8dhKS7oeRL6aXFDv.png","name":"Turner Network Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monte Walsh","video":false,"vote_average":6.083,"vote_count":36}
