A film collaboration between Kiki gatekeeper, Twiggy Pucci Garçon, and Swedish filmmaker Sara Jordenö, we’re granted exclusive access into this high stakes world, where tough competitions act as a gateway into the daily lives of LGBTQ youth of color in NYC. The new generation of ballroom youth use the motto, “Not About us Without Us”. Twiggy and Sara’s insider-outsider approach to their stories breathes fresh life into the representation of a marginalized community who demand visibility and real political power.","popularity":1.805,"poster_path":"/8zduTqlE1BKIFDwp5hxR4Ajcbwm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Story AB","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":110994,"logo_path":"/Vb6ZSuCtUiKh0rDpQl6YJ5PnQd.png","name":"Hard Working Movies","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i Väst","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":77440,"logo_path":"/dCT5rOH3IEAFHQk6LVpfsG29eUg.png","name":"Film i Västerbotten","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":12478,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Swedish Arts Grants Committee","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":32040,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York State Council on the Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live your truth","title":"Kiki","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":19}
