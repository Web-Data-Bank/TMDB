Fontana makes his entrance on this beautifully produced show in a hot air balloon surrounded by large toy airplanes that drop from the ceiling as the Choir opens with the number \"The Candyman/Pocketful of Miracles.\" Other standout moments are a duet with the Count and the Choir's organist, Richard Elliott, to the tune of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\" a medley of songs from Sesame Street® as well as the popular \"Keep Christmas With You,\" and hilarious hijinks and banter from the Muppets® from Sesame Street® throughout the show. This show is a world-class performance perfect for all ages as you celebrate the Christmas holiday.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mxX0L5eezj9ktVSjnEhuUiaWcL2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70417,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mormon Tabernacle","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Keep Christmas With You","title":"Keep Christmas With You","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
