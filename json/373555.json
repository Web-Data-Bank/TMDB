We focus our view on the human-landscape relationship, facing it in two temporal dimensions: the geological and human.  This definition synthesize well the will of the project: \"The landscape are layers of time condensed into an image\". We seek to merge different temporal layers into a single image, proposing two exploration lines: emphasize the ephemeral and fleeting passage of man over the territory; and invite to a leisurely contemplation showing the poetry and mystery of the movements of landscape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strata of the Image","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
