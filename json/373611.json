A film projector and several studio cameras connected through a simple vision mixer to monitors and a video tape deck, recorded a series of procedures and adjustments made to the system during experiments and ‘rehearsals’. The new media of analogue video delivered motion pictures that displayed in ‘real time’, the state of a system in synthesis.
