Floating within a backdrop of smokestacks, beacon towers and passing trains, dislocated Hollywood images filled with apocalyptic angst are re-framed and reflected through car windows and mirrors as the displacement of the radio broadcast soundtrack collides with the projections upon and surrounding the multiple screens. In VINELAND, the nocturnal landscape is seen as a border zone aglow with dreamlike illusions revealing overlapping realities at the intersection of nostalgia and alienation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yWWhqPsQerRVtNFsNMIWBoAtcAX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vineland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
