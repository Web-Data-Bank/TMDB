His best friend, Sang-chul, is yet to find direction in his life but always lives by his life motto: to live and die for his friends. Dong-leung, a naive and timid student, consistently lacks the courage to live on his own and always submits to his father's orders. Although radically different in personalities, San-hae, Sang-chul, and Dong-leung are the best of friends. Then one day, while gambling on a card game, they inherit a run-down bar. Initially excited about their earnings, the three friends later realize that running a bar is far from easy. Then San-hae comes up with an idea to bring in customers; he decides to create a bartending extravaganza entitled \"The Show\", a brand new concept in Seoul during the 1970s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xKcqu7Z5Q4dFJDpQRCuNT7yXgs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Show Show Show","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
