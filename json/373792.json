His military rank was that of a sergeant. During these times, he would go back to his home, located in the middle of Damascus city, take off his military uniform and return to his normal life, working as an assistant director with his friend, the filmmaker Mohammed Malas. To make sense of this schizophrenic situation, he decides to take his camera and start shooting a ‘making-of’ that will eventually go beyond Malas’s film.","popularity":1.345,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2014-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Immortal Sergeant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
