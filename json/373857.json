This style of tattoo is very painful and she prefers not to do it this way. She also has a habit of mixing in some snake venom into the ink she uses for tattooing. This can cause some interesting and sometimes lethal side-effects whenever her clients are in the heat of passion. In other words, you do not want to mess with Soo-na. Now she has a new client, Ji-soon, who is very persistent in wanting her to use the stitchery tattoo technique. Soo-na gives in and agrees to finish the tattoo of a Medusa on his back. She quickly learns that behind the Medusa lies a dark secret that has ties to her own past. What follows is a tale of revenge, murder, and tattoos.","popularity":3.147,"poster_path":"/d9Bv6PC1q9LBNMqMQXlQxk83cVn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Korea Story","origin_country":""},{"id":11430,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dasepo Club","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":114352,"logo_path":"/1ShJ46AFFXxSEieMttnAI1jxtnR.png","name":"Wide Release","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":126293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dhutayeon","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2015-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tattooist","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
