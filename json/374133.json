He posts a $5 reward, which the rats change to $5,000. Alice and Julius accept the challenge; they play a tune and the rats gather around, but they won't fall for the old \"follow me into the river\" trick. Fortunately, a very powerful vacuum cleaner is nearby, and Alice and Julius suck all the rats into it. The king gives them their reward: $5.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice the Piper","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2}
