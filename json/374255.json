Among many other honors, Honig received honorary \"knighthoods\" from Spain and Portugal for his seminal translations of Lorca, Calder√≥n, and Pessoa that awakened English-speaking readers to the work of these literary giants. This suite of six short films reveals a poet and wordsmith who may have lost his memory and his command of language, but still retains his sense of rhythm, rhyme and sublime musicality. And through it all, his dignity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Translating Edwin Honig: A Poet's Alzheimer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
