This film takes a look at young athletes adept at overriding cruise control to express a completely different philosophy.  The Lillois label COSMONOSTRO signs the soundtrack for these 30 minutes of abandon.  With this final film our tribe takes a final bow and pays hommage to these past years of complicity and adventure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cruise Control","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
