It is a short portrayal of one person's descent into a state of degradation. In spite of her affluence, Dirty is rendered helpless in the hands of those she sought to patronise. The shifting points of view of this film allow the viewer to experience the protagonist as she is seen by herself, and how the world sees her.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dirty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
