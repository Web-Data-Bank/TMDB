Their lyrics speak of daily life; civil war, street violence, corruption, drugs and the disappearance of close friends. Despite everything, they cling to hope and this they express through their music. The film is made in 8 mm and DVCAM and includes Flash Animations. Some of the footage is shot by the musicians themselves. The power of Latin American hip-hop street life confronts the horror of the Columbian war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":70933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vidicon GmbH Berlin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beatbox Colombia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
