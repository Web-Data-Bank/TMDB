Already overwhelmed by personal problems, he decides to throw himself out the window. He is stopped in his tracks by his next-door neighbor who suggests an unexpected plan to keep his job: pretend to be a homosexual. Assuming that in this age of political correctness, one does not fire a gay man, he manages to convince Pignon to play along while remaining a discreet and shy little man... What will change is the way others look at him. Pignon will thus benefit from an unusual reintegration by coming out of a closet where he had never entered.","popularity":1.919,"poster_path":"/t25ohg4xT2tcZrxbMHptCVNt5IC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le placard","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
