Not the best times for shop owners like Jozef Piasecki - obstacles from authorities, restricted wholesale supplies. Moreover, he constantly argues with his son, the 17 year old Witek. Witek experiences love for the first time. This should be a time of great excitement for him, but Witek, being rather anxious about the future, becomes an example of a youth generation growing up under the long shadow of Stalin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sUu28JKG3OriQiWqO7fplS2BBqi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53518,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespół Filmowy Silesia","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1982-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Haunted","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
