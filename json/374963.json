The resulting damage was then repaired and the separate lengths joined together in strict order. At its simplest it is a pun on the phrase \"to shoot film\". My idea was to portray the concept of shooting a film as a physical and literal action. The film can be seen as pure documentation of an act. The damage done becomes the image and the soundtrack.\" -Pope","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nWGVLuULQXm8WfoQehBmfbJ9pjt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shot Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
