His daughter, Serafima,  is an aspiring singer with great potential, and her father’s anger is  aroused when she begins singing in the operetta composed by  Aleksei Mukhin, thus abandoning what he considers the higher calling  of opera. Mukhin’s work, however, demands a high level of ability  from his soloist, and Anton Ivanovich is persuaded of the legitimacy of  operetta as a musical genre when, in a dream, he is visited by Johann  Sebastian Bach himself, who tells him that ‘people need all kinds of  music’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u0orM7XQlJoiFDrIv0QtRmtzacN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1941-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anton Ivanovich Gets Angry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
