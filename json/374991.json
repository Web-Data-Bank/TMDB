Her friend, Linda Lo, also unhappily married, is there as well, dressed for the photos, and Si's lover is hiding in another room. Enter Henry Lo with a call girl, and Ma himself, intent on killing Si. Chance intervenes: a best-selling author and a prude, Lovely Pak, pays a call; she wants Ma to publish her books.
