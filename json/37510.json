In the space of 48 hours, a friend dies of an overdose, they are ripped off by criminals and arrested and assaulted by police. They bungle a break-in, get chased by hooligans and one is sent to a methadone clinic. The search for drugs veers between farce and tragedy, but it never stops.","popularity":0.814,"poster_path":"/ugrgOytcJdefJstEEWsupbWVk2y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Radio and Television Board of the Australia Council","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1975-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Humour... in a black vein","title":"Pure Shit","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
