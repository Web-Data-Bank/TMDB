The result was the creation of 400 short films depicting various faces of work in the modern world. Now Antje Ehmann and architect Luis Feduchi have returned to the project, this time with filmmakers from Warsaw and Berlin. Will the films made be able to show how the pandemic influenced work and professional reality? Can all the changes occurring be captured in the form of an image? Will the movies themselves change? The German title of the project \"Eine Einstellung zur Arbeit\" has a double meaning: it means working in one film take and at the same time an attitude towards work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2020-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labour in a Single Shot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
