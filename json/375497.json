Because he does things his own way, Albert Serra’s most narrative and wordy film was not meant for cinema: produced by the Venice Biennale, it was part of an installation, its chapters shown simultaneously on several screens. Singularity could very well have been called “Velvet Goldmine”, as it sings the meeting of brothels and tunnels, of a golden stud and lustful bodies (both shown as abstractions).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bbAlqEmPtnIT4OnxJbT8MEVcGpr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13720,"logo_path":"/wqBR878P0PvPAEWE8xxG8VkHP8i.png","name":"Andergraun Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2015-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":780,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Singularity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
