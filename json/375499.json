A portrait of Grenada-born Myrtle Wardally (b.1936), a leader of the Cleaners’ Action Group Strike in 1972, it features her discussing the partial success of that campaign and also her childhood in the Caribbean. It’s also an experiment – as probing as it is rapturous – in the politics of film form, and a fascinating deconstruction of the idea of Myrtle as a “symbol of struggle, the nightcleaners, working women, immigrants, mothers, blacks”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rSxdC1kAVXQH8n9mJR6R4kZvcFr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"36 to 77","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
