The video layers haunting imagery and humorous iconoclasm, referencing everything from television episodes of I Love Lucy to Charcot’s 19th Century photos of female hysterics. Delirium contends that female mental illness must be understood within the political/social arena, and that in many instances women’s reactions of violence, anger, and depression are indeed sane reactions to abhorrent situations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delirium","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
