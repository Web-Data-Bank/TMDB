Once the wind and rivers worked on it, today it bears the signs of human activity. The Hungarian Puszta is different nonetheless: it lives a secret life where always happens something. Big birds hustle and push each other, the traffic of the white, salty lakes competes that of major airports, antlers clash like swords, and an owl claps on all this. The most peculiar creature is the protagonist itself. The golden jackal once lived here, but it vanished for decades because of constant persecution. But this four-legged predator, defying the danger,  has returned and founded a family. The new pack howls in the frosty night: \"This is our land!\"","popularity":0.694,"poster_path":"/kLg21tFTFLW4XJ79f4IkgYQsaz7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155295,"logo_path":null,"name":"NatFilm Hungary Kft.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kunság","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
