With MTV's cameras following, they'll return for the very first time to the treatment facility they retreated to back in November 2010 to speak candidly to their recovering peers about their experiences, and to thank the counselors and staff who they say kept them alive. They'll also let the MTV audience witness first-hand their on-going evolution as an artist - as they ditch their bubble-gum Disney past and tries on a new persona as confessional singer-songwriter, and perform an album full of deeply personal material in-front of sold-out crowds for the first time.","popularity":1.724,"poster_path":"/ljfJcba2x9f8mKDVUUuOzFcO1d7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89394,"logo_path":"/m1Hku3PhgdsQiPO8uVe7szyrxAb.png","name":"RadicalMedia","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demi Lovato: Stay Strong","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":20}
