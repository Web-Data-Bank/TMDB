A member of the first Japanese expedition to reach the summit of Mt Everest in 1970, Uemura also accomplished several \"firsts\". He was the first man to reach the North Pole solo, climb Denali solo, and float down the Amazon river solo. In the film, Uemura returns to Tokyo after a stint in Siorapaluk in Northern Greenland. In Tokyo, he reconnects with an old friend and, over coffee, shares his life story - from his days as a college dropout to his successful expedition to the top of Everest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3363,"logo_path":"/sj3vD7n63bTCih7bcf6GnWvRf1Q.png","name":"MBS","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":2752,"logo_path":"/qEGEoCAV9FWAuohymR5I0vjJMgM.png","name":"dentsu Music And Entertainment","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-06-07","revenue":12800000,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost in the Wilderness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
