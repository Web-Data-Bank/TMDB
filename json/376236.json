And that’s just the tipping point in this stranger-than-fiction tale. With the balls of a P.T. Barnum, the gonads of goats, and the wishful dreams of flaccid men, Brinkley amassed a fortune, was almost elected Governor of Kansas, invented junk mail and the infomercial, and built the world’s most powerful radio station. By the time all of the twists and turns of Brinkley’s story are revealed, Nuts! certainly earns its title.","popularity":2.41,"poster_path":"/rytoWiX1qVM0B1MvfAWwMGulKT6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gland Power Films","origin_country":""},{"id":72768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cartuna","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuts!","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":25}
