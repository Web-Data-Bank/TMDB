What he finds is a complicated mix of tragedy and inspiration in the various ways climate change is affecting our value systems. How to Let Go of the World delivers a sobering portrait of the state of climate change, and takes stock of what makes humans survivors, and our societies so creative and resilient.","popularity":0.868,"poster_path":"/eZEOvacyC5Bfl7eX1D5umNr8E8R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8790,"logo_path":null,"name":"International WOW Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can't Change","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":9}
