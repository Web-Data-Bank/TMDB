Long before he directed Boyhood, Richard Linklaterâ€™s intense desire to create fueled his work outside the Hollywood system. Rather than leave Texas, he chose to collaborate with like-minded artists crafting modest, low-budget films in a DIY style. His ability to showcase realistic characters and tell honest stories was evident from his films, and others soon took notice of his raw talent.","popularity":1.789,"poster_path":"/jRUT11DsoJF2sjgAE0bFjQZqu2W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10977,"logo_path":null,"name":"Picturebox","origin_country":""},{"id":79958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black/Bernstein Production","origin_country":""},{"id":42039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts+Labor","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Linklater: Dream Is Destiny","video":false,"vote_average":6.972,"vote_count":18}
