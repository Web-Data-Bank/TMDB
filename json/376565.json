An enigmatic, focused, and extremely skilled professional, he leaves a trail of dead bodies behind him as he swirls through polite society, frequently called upon to wield a pistol as a surrogate in duels at dawn.

What transpires uncovers a series of revelations about his past and his present self.","popularity":6.905,"poster_path":"/zlVkUY2bBJ5XYTDiry16u70oayQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5630,"logo_path":"/s0mHCw53fp6EAapR7g0dwYbz0l5.png","name":"Non-Stop Productions","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-09-29","revenue":6101904,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"On The Dark Side Of Honor","title":"The Duelist","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":80}
