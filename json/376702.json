In the spectacular setting of a former submarine factory, American director and universal artist Robert Wilson creates a poetic visual world in which the mystical musical language of the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt can cast its meditative spell. Three of Pärt’s major works – Adam’s Lament, Tabula rasa, and Miserere, as well as Sequentia, a new work composed especially for this production – are brought together here using light, space, and movement to create a tightly-woven Gesamtkunstwerk in which the artistic visions of these two great artists mirror each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7XEI6TBhzz8o2fOWyWEvqh7GDzY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accentus Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adam's Passion","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
