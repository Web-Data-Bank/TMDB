Although only two were produced, and one was destroyed in an accident, the Valkyrie built an impressive databank of high-speed flight invaluable to aviation development. This DVD, with nearly 4 hours of rare footage of the XB-70, newly transferred on modern telecines, brings you the flight test program of the XB-70 as never before. Contains rare progress reports, footage from rollout, extensive footage of test flights, and footage from the A/V-2 accident. All footage is color. Some footage is silent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":71974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aircraft Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":235,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MACH 3 XB-70 Valkyrie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
