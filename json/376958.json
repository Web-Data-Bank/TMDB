Two alley cats, looking over a fence, see Champ in his attire and begin razzing him. Champ does a slow turn and starts after the cats and, in no time, the studio is a shambles. Doc sees an announcement of a dog show, the winner of which receives a $50,000 prize and a banquet. Desperately in need of money, Doc gets the idea of entering Champ in the upcoming show and begins grooming him. Doc gives Champ a bath, lessons in proper speech, walking with books balanced on head, and the proper attire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pest Of The Show","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
