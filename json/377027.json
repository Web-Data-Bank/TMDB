The film tells how a 'brotherhood' of four Danish directors armed with a radical Manifesto, has inspired, outraged and provoked filmmakers and filmgoers the world over. The rules of Dogme95 take filmmaking back to its brass-tacks - stories must be set in the here and now; the films must be shot on location, with a handheld camera, using natural light, and direct sound; the rules forbid murders and weapons (staples of the much-loved action-movie genre); and, most amusingly, the director must not be credited (that holds also for the director of The Name of this Film is Dogme95...).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ef8S5y5acfOVPqfQ3DOQMdomASP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minerva Pictures Group","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Name of This Film Is Dogme95","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
