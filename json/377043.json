A good maxim for a filmmaker whose life and work is explored in this loving documentary. Avant-garde in method but nostalgic in temperament, he's remembered by family and friends like Tilda Swinton and Nigel Terry. Excellent use of Super 8 blends with revelatory stories, not least his wish to cast Terry-Thomas as Ariel in The Tempest!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e6OftaXXQdRN6thAYEcWB3JtYtQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Derek Jarman: Life as Art","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
