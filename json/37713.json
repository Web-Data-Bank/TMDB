The show was produced by Marvel Productions and Sunbow Productions, who made a pilot for NBC. The pilot aired, but for unknown reasons, it was never turned into a full-blown series. Despite it not becoming a full series, the pilot has aired in syndication, and was later released on video.","popularity":4.768,"poster_path":"/fiATD0LBgBQ5DgjFaqeFt5aG7yL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2301,"logo_path":"/qdPhBEP8sjK3Eb3rKc94554gcZt.png","name":"Marvel Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3313,"logo_path":"/10T51dh4ha4KrSksb5gAEcpRz9N.png","name":"Sunbow Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5542,"logo_path":"/ayE4LIqoAWotavo7xdvYngwqGML.png","name":"Toei Animation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome.
