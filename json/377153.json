Bonifacio’s widow is searching for her husband’s missing dead body; as she and her followers stumble deeper into the jungle, they become entangled in the dense thicket of their own guilt and responsibility. The Spanish governor tries to play off the various rebel factions and their utopian visions against each other. At the same time, a badly wounded companion of Bonifacio reflects upon the victims a revolution inevitably creates. Mythology, facts and a vibrant sense of history merge.","popularity":2.346,"poster_path":"/2EODet7CLf62h8GJnvEx2OlWj78.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57612,"logo_path":"/dg4sSBjn9pv5mswjUxItrPLZf6X.png","name":"Epicmedia","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":60122,"logo_path":"/nYYK38OJO7OJVxUxA6h7JFhbvhN.png","name":"Ten17p","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":33812,"logo_path":"/fwpLmRnRFxnYg9mD8K4FOb0GqwT.png","name":"Sine Olivia Pilipinas","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2016-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":485,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the end, history will judge who was right and true.","title":"A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":14}
