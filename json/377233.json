Beyond scenes that were not shown on any TV channel, including flagrant violence during the acts, Impasse reveals what passengers, workers, specialists and businessmen think. It exposes the contradictions and differences in opinion between the local and statewide government, and the students. It discusses questions that intermingle and complete each other: why has the city become a symbol for the fight for public transportation? What did the police do in the UDESC act? Why is urban mobility one of the great themes of the 21st century? Is there, after all, a way out of this impasse?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jGHzaJ3t9Zb2IvnezsCupceqLW3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Impasse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
