Fatso, now smitten, is determined to win her affection but his clumsiness threatens the relationship of the two, despite Cupid's advice. He dumps a trash can on her head, shoves a bouquet of flowers in her face, knocks her in the mud, dumps a beehive on her head, and knocks her into a cave. Finally, he succeeds in winning her with \"the caveman routine\" only to discover she has a family of kids he must now look after. Furious, he vengefully chases Cupid into the distance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1961-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bear and the Bees","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
