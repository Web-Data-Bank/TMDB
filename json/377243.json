Little Pig is feeling happy and decides to go for a swim. On the way she meets a hedgehog with too few prickles, a crow whose beak is too long, a green lamb and a little calf covered in white spots. None of them look quite 'normal'. They all set off with Little Pig to go swimming. They help out a turtle, who grants each of them a wish. But nothing turns out quite the way they planned.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7639,"logo_path":null,"name":"PennFilm Studio","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2012-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just a Little","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
