Their evil nemesis Wall-Enberg are planning to steal billions of euros of the European Union's grants to culture. The grant of 350 million kronor, paid by an Italian bank acting as intermediary, equals 60 billion lire but through assistance of a Sicilian \"businessman\", this sum becomes 60 billion kronor when transferred. The money is to be transferred to a large number of bank accounts, and the account numbers are saved on a floppy disc that the Jönsson gang is trying to steal.","popularity":1.668,"poster_path":"/5qrDx7n1BVsVI81kcO0Av8vVplz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2669,"logo_path":"/xuSvgLUZJyrY4IO1jBpmlqpHqyc.png","name":"Filmlance International","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":17593,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmhuset","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":3899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nordisk Tonefilm","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":5785,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandrew Metronome Sverige","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2802,"logo_path":"/x3cLK4hmrDxBeoD7eWbfJL2dGxP.png","name":"TV4","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2000-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jönsson Gang at High Stakes","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":24}
