Yet the U.S. Navy had two aces up its sleeve: advance knowledge of Japanese plans and a dive-bomber that was nearly invulnerable to attack. When the smoke cleared after the U.S. ambush, four Japanese aircraft carriers -- the Kaga, the Soryu, the Hiryu and the Akagi -- lay on the ocean floor. The program shows how the U.S. Navy and private enterprise teamed up on a 1999 expedition that solved a half-century of military mystery: where exactly did the Japanese ships go down?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thomas Horton Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Search for the Japanese Fleet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
