He has been working at the Swedish Mint and the doctor, who has started to think like Sickan, has written a plan for making a burglary there, on Melvin's back. However, something goes wrong. They don't get a lot of Deutsch-marks as they planned but instead, they end up on a ship going to Poland, together with bunches and bunches of Polish Zlotys (the Polish currency). In Poland, they discover that the mafia are very interested in that money and Wall-Enberg is working with the mafia.","popularity":2.142,"poster_path":"/9GSXNiepGKEUiP7tUV0xMw8qFRP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespól Filmowy \"Tor\"","origin_country":""},{"id":3899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nordisk Tonefilm","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":1728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandrews","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":57354,"logo_path":"/8CrMUkfg01tmrNbWxq0s6v0Dg6m.png","name":"TV3 Sverige","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1995-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jönsson Gang's Greatest Robbery","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":27}
