He was only 58. His furniture designs are no longer made in Denmark, but their production has been revived in China. Thomas Mogensen, one of Børge’s two sons, vividly describes the world of the famous architect and the strain that his professional life put on him:  “He wanted to make the chair to end all chairs. And he wanted to design the perfect closet…which he did. He spent an enormous amount of time designing these closets – a process that gave him the peace of mind he couldn’t provide for himself.” Join us on a journey back in time, to learn how one man managed to produce an vast amount of internationally recognized designs before his premature death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5jkfZVTh5YCP9Biic4L4fQba2Ut.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Børge Mogensen, Designs for Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
