Lucas, still quite immature, finds a “big brother” in Bert, a guide who is going to take him straight to the brink of catastrophe. But very quickly, boredom resurfaces and the freewheeling sense of being on an adventure evades them. Should they return to the fold, or keep moving on? Their drifting logic compels them to blindly forge ahead.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gb1OHOYi02xtfGNQ5U1k5XK8WXW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3134,"logo_path":"/iNHmwxAZ9armVqZFq8iVqsVbWdK.png","name":"A Private View","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":20482,"logo_path":"/ncZtCy1XzmVeN674GNBDdvMc8b0.png","name":"Iota Production","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2015-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome Home","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
