Some escaped and returned to their homeland as heroes but many stayed on in this alien new world... The life stories of these rebels are full of acts of bravery and derring-do. In their own words they tell tales that are at once stirring, heart wrenching, dark, creepy, and even funny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o803Un6AuKGjuhNozzXssr9ghtW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72078,"logo_path":"/yRikfpa6bTBv4mccdgb0RRv8LjB.png","name":"Tile Films","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":72077,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roar Film","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2015-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death or Liberty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
