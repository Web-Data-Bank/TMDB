Despite their divided histories, these women are struggling for a common goal: Breaking the silence, reconciliation, and political empowerment for women. We follow Godeliève and Florida organizing self-empowerment trainings for women to confront patriarchal structures; to the rural area, where the new generation of children born out of rape are redefining their identities, facing a life shoulder to shoulder with the murderers of their families, their fathers. And where more and more women decide to break the silence and speak out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r3umSqQC28Y4S7lE9LSC2mOY0xx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God Is Not Working on Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
