The two main characters in that film were a prostitute and a junkie, and because of that, it was never shown on television. So I thought I would rework that film, copied those two faces and took the last two seconds of the film of the two faces and stretched them each to 12 Â½ minutes. I made a 25 minute film out of two faces. - James Benning","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Faces","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
