It's a story told through a largely forgotten film archive that movingly documents the final years of coal's heyday from the 1940s to the 1980s. One priceless piece of footage features a ballet performance by tutu-wearing colliers. Featuring contributions from those who worked underground, those who lived in the pit villages, those who filmed them at work and at play and those - like Billy Elliot writer Lee Hall - who have been inspired by what made coalfield culture so unique.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Coal Was King","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
