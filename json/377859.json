It begins with the missing of a prostitute Ping. Ping is one of the tenants who live with her young daughter. In the process of finding Ping, Li discovered there had been a lot of missing prostitutes in this building, yet none of them were found. The building was somehow isolated from the outside world and a massacre begins. Li and the prostitutes have to find Ping and to fight a battle of wits with the invisible murderer.
