The action is projected by strong characters whose fundamentally sound instincts become distorted by raw passion. The performance draws upon both human and technical resources including a large ballet and varies in mood from the happy carnival to scenes of the darkest gloom and horror.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/273ooI6YNd4Xjc1GEO22yLJaAvf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19492,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArtHaus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1986-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A fine performance of consistently high quality","title":"La Gioconda","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
