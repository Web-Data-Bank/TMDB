In her garden, she sips tea with her friends, all of them very important women: writers, singers and actresses filled with wit and exuberance.

There is no distance in her art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mieLj8zOnMVbcLBmhsorZ0gbDz3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Els Films de la Rambla S.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":5085,"logo_path":"/mPuVc7m1Ki7OQQvAYwYfIlEI3vu.png","name":"TV3","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cola, Colita, Colassa (Oda a Barcelona)","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
