Aaron, a pillar in Jerusalem's Orthodox community is respected by friends and family. However, when he hires handsome runaway student Ezri to assist with his business, sexual tensions bristle and the pair cautiously embark on a love affair. Meanwhile, a neighbouring shopkeeper persists in seeing a man of her own choosing, even though she's been promised by her father to another. As forbidden truths come to the fore, these lovers are forced to either confront or relent in the face of a centuries-old religious community, with startling results.","popularity":6.432,"poster_path":"/uZZphgPC6NOgBHhOvSyYZN5g4DL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33241,"logo_path":null,"name":"Israel Fund for Film Production","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":33242,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pimpa Film Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":2677,"logo_path":"/6xN0FuEK9yXaK2jvWjSW2YxwOYG.png","name":"Riva Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":33243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Totally","origin_country":""},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":33244,"logo_path":"/kNQbbo0UaSrHVF3RjPWgXnUs00g.png","name":"yes","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":33245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keshet Broadcasting","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":33248,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports","origin_country":""},{"id":33249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Israel Film Council","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2009-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eyes Wide Open","video":false,"vote_average":6.508,"vote_count":65}
