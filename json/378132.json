Nothing has escaped this cultural phenomenon: radio, song, personalities, great events and social phenomena have fueled this delirious humor, so biting and so funny because more true than life. Reflecting a generation, RBO has obviously contributed to giving humor its letters of nobility within Quebec culture. 3rd of 5 DVDs in the box: Rock et Belles Oreilles: THE BOX AND THE BONUS","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3uDUOjSbOKDztkhXk2LNxxMEsNZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24004,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amérimage-Spectra","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock et Belles Oreilles: The DVD 1989-1990","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
