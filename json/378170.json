From then on he was determined to live as a castaway on an uninhabited Pacific Island with a girl Friday.  When he realised his dream in 1989 he was just 18 years old. The adventure became a media sensation with journalists flying halfway round the world to cover the story. Martin kept a video diary of his experience.  In 2001 he returned to the Pacific to make a critically acclaimed documentary. The Real Castaway reunites the two castaways on their desert island 12 years after their experience. Itâ€™s a story about adventure, growing up and the pursuit of an impossible dream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3exw890bvY9vEN70Lrg4wkeKOgY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61487,"logo_path":null,"name":"ITN Factual Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Castaway","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
