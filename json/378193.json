Through interviews with herself, with her family - Ann Bierlich (mother), Asger Leth (brother), Jørgen Leth (stepfather), friends and people from the film industry it tells us about Stine's life from being a child actress to becoming a celebrated young star of the 80's.  The film is a comment on today's worshipping of stars, and how fame has almost become a drug in itself. It’s as if here’s every answer to any doubt.  But as Stine's story shows, reality can actually be the opposite.","popularity":0.808,"poster_path":"/vVvqF0ZbFER18FmthoDbnPE88dh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Babyfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Født til Filmen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
