After wishing he had more friends, Manny finds a mysterious collar and puts it on Rufus, the family dog. Suddenly, Rufus turns into a boy! Manny's not sure what to do, so he enrolls Rufus in school. When the other students notice Rufus's silly dog antics -- chasing squirrels, eating without utensils, asking for belly rubs, and catching a soccer ball with his mouth -- he immediately becomes the most popular kid around. Manny is jealous of his new best friend but eventually learns that a dog's loyalty to his owner always comes first.","popularity":3.451,"poster_path":"/n9gVLgAhjhaaaAOguhwVDQdH5E4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5371,"logo_path":"/2GFJ3jJ7dhjqcOGj41aTwd3OhQT.png","name":"Nickelodeon Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rufus","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":37}
