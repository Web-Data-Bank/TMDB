Rookies with stars in their eyes join tough-as-nails veterans like Chi-Chi Cruz, Leatherface, Eric the Lumberjack, and Crash Crimson to pack into a van and head for the far northern reaches of Manitoba. Only accessible in winter by frozen lake roads, these remote First Nations communities get a rare show of live wrestling entertainment, complete with stunners and body slams. Wrestling with the North captures all the pain, glory and determination of these die-hard wrestlers and through the wrestlers' eyes we glimpse northern aboriginal communities holding fast to their traditions while embracing a pop-culture circus with zeal.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/nnlJGqIB0MF1gcGZQqaASEFfedZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vermillion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The pain, glory and determination of the \"toughest wrestling tour on Earth\"","title":"Wrestling with the North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
