The stronger is destined always to throw the weaker from the nest. Man also has his ways, often to hurt those closest to him.  Lukas suffers at the hands of a father who has withdrawn since the loss of his wife. Killed whilst rescuing the infant Lukas, the boy now carries the burden of her death.  Our eagleâ€™s story begins in the nest. The first-born chick pushes his weaker brother to a certain death on the forest floor. But fate intervenes and the chick is found by Lukas. Naming him Abel, Lukas cares for the creature in secret, finding a love and companionship denied to him at home. But when the day comes to release Abel back into the wild, will Lukas find his own release into a new life?","popularity":6.422,"poster_path":"/n7ghzx9azfBho8WNB02jqOlAm5P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10331,"logo_path":"/iyUmqBwQpsWOKw5uZ0j0DI5FN9t.png","name":"Terra Mater Factual Studios","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":142064,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmVergnuegen","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2015-12-24","revenue":3685708,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes a friendship sets you free","title":"Brothers of the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":148}
