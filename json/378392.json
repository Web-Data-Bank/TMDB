The special was produced by Bob Banner and directed by Joe Hamilton.  Banner came up with the idea in the Fall of 1961. Burnett was then a regular on The Garry Moore Show and Andrews had appeared as a guest twice, performing the song \"Big D\" from the musical The Most Happy Fella in the first appearance; and in the show's 1961 Christmas special, she did a number with Burnett and fellow guest Gwen Verdon plus an early performance of \"My Favorite Things\" (three years before she performed it as Maria while filming The Sound of Music).  Mike Nichols wrote the script and co-wrote the song \"You're So London\" with Ken Welch. Writing began in February 1962 and the stars rehearsed for two weeks before the March 5 taping","popularity":0.946,"poster_path":"/5RV9DBku7iigQvI2cn5KLCwicyA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bob Banner Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just Carol and Julie onstage with a bunch of oversized Austrian children...","title":"Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
