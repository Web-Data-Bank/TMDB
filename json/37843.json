Some of them are mutilated, but most of them are sucked into the sand, disappearing without a trace. What is the creature responsible? Where does it live, and where did it come from?

Meanwhile, David Huffman and Mariana Hill are once-almost-married old friends, reunited over the death of her mother on the beach, and searching for clues in the abandoned buildings where they used to play when they were young.","popularity":4.449,"poster_path":"/3BfSQmwTm8LGv2KZKcDJnFuBbIC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78004,"logo_path":null,"name":"Empress Film Production Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":14323,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compass International Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water - you can't get to it.","title":"Blood Beach","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":56}
