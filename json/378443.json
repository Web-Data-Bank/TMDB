Blending archive, reconstruction, animation, 35mm rostrum, and observational photography, the film explores the transformation of these objects from clinical material to revered art objects examining the lives of the creators and the changing contexts in which the objects were produced and displayed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adamson Collection Trust","origin_country":""},{"id":72310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fly Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abandoned Goods","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
