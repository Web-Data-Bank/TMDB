She is eventually assigned the job of redesigning the cells of a new prison, but even when her enthusiasm returns a little with the assignment, she is discouraged by the pseudo-intellectual stance of the prison warden and a non-communicative visit to her father. In an act of desperation, she steals some money and a gun - and fully intends to use them both.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viba Film","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1983-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eva","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
