On one: a hungry, shipwrecked Aardvark. On the other: an army of (food) Ants. The Aardvark knows that this is true because he sees the Ants in his spyglass. All that you have to do is swim right over there... except that there's a mean old shark who won't let that happen. The Aardvark tries, but he fails. Next, he gets a surfboard. The shark eats that as if it's newspaper.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nDURnz6yr5Dz6j5uxmhj5Na4SLh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8402,"logo_path":null,"name":"DePatie-Freleng Enterprises","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isle of Caprice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
