They have a nine-year-old daughter and are expecting their second child. When they learn that their child will not be born healthy, they are at first optimistic that they will be able to meet this challenge – although they have no idea what awaits them. But the closer it gets to the due date, the more Astrid begins to worry about the future of her unborn child as well as that of her family and her career. After many discussions and arguments Astrid realises that the decision that will affect all their lives must be made by her alone. What complicates matters further is the fact that, as a successful entertainer, she is in the eye of the public and the media.","popularity":2.788,"poster_path":"/nKzmeKmZWIoSPbwxocStemcTgwL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":296,"logo_path":"/kMFX59w5Sgxx9PVpV4k3ZgspRmz.png","name":"Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":16844,"logo_path":"/wy2JQsrqBGhDBg8d57SGIrZtMAh.png","name":"Zero One Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"24 Weeks","video":false,"vote_average":6.618,"vote_count":34}
