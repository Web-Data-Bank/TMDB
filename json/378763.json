When her colleague is assaulted by a male customer, she steps in to help, only to accidentally kill the assaulter. At the court, Min-a insists that she had no choice ? she had to protect her colleague - but the situation is not favorable to her. Taking advantage of her sexual identity, the prosecutor drives the case as if the murder were a result out of jealousy, and Min-a’s own lawyer does not pay attention to her situation. Not until Min-a is placed in a men’s jail and is seized with terror do the human rights issues for transgender people emerge. Min-a is finally transferred to a prison for females, but still she suffers from misunderstanding. Presenting the transgender human rights issues as a court drama, this film tries to correct the myriad misunderstandings toward transgender people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mxXehxCXVetgzdXYSGJ3VE5g4LQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mindullae Pictures","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":112074,"logo_path":"/A9DKWvOT9TNwmF9P2lQQIYEqEo4.png","name":"Indieplug","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2016-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Half","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
