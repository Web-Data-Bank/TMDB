The Blues Brothers were an unforgettable part of Saturday Night Live's golden era, making their musical debut in bee costumes singing \"I'm a King Bee,\" and becoming an overnight sensation. Switching to hats and shades inspired by John Lee Hooker, they combined classic Chicago Blues with Stax-Volt R&amp;B to create a sound all their own. Their first album, Briefcase Full of Blues, went double-platinum and led quickly to their hit movie and milestone soundtrack album. The rest is history, and it's all here in a music-filled, memory-blasting account of a band that will always be on a mission from God.","popularity":2.648,"poster_path":"/80BOByNSg3XQzA9pdDaXR3yr2AH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1756,"logo_path":"/d7YyNzysIF0lSb4lJRf1ar6MHxi.png","name":"Broadway Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best of the Blues Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
