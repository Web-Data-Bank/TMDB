He is responsible for the equipment, building materials and food (mainly chickens) to arrive in the isolated Chinese prefab camp. The Congolese government was supposed to deliver these things but so far the team hasn't received anything. With Eddy (a Congolese man who speaks Mandarin fluently) as an intermediate, Lao Yang is forced to leave the camp and deal with local Congolese entrepreneurs, because without the construction materials the road works will cease. What follows is an endless, harsh, but absurdly funny roller coaster of negotiations and misunderstandings, as Lao Yang learns about the Congolese way of making deals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/njCWJzokb3H1kZGyCJNmhFdBIym.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7115,"logo_path":"/o2EG4i2JfK1o3EaXuaBKXo1PDlz.png","name":"Savage Film","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2011-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two men representing two different cultures clash in the dust of the former Belgian colony, the Democratic Republic of Congo.","title":"Empire of Dust","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":6}
