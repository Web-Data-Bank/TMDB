Among the gags: As Roland plays the harp, Rattfink tries to discourage him by drumming. When that fails, he inverts the drum to reveal a beehive; the bees attack, the harp strings send Roland back into a fountain, and the bee-stung Roland still presents Rattfink with a flower. Rattfink air-drops a bag of flour on Roland; the resulting cloud of flour engulfs RF's plane, and he crashes into a building. Finally, Roland is in a jam session; Rattfink paints a can of nitroglycerine to look like a drum, but slips on a banana peel and explodes. Roland puts a flower on his grave; Rattfink's ghost hurls it at Roland.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8402,"logo_path":null,"name":"DePatie-Freleng Enterprises","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hurts and Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
