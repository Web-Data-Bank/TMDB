It's the first time they've all been in the same house at the same time since the parent's marriage seven years before--which wouldn't be a problem if they all liked each other. But they don't. And matters only get worse with the unexpected arrival of an ex-boyfriend, an unannounced live television broadcast, and the outing of well-kept family secrets.
