The accolades and sales successes achieved by State Of the Art Of Computer Animation prompted the 1990 release of The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey, a title that would become the first member of the successful The Mind's Eye series. The next decade (1990â€“2000) would be taken up almost entirely with the production of 19 feature-length 3-D computer animated package films for home release.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fwLv4yathB8kYGlISaJXtCRmKOe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The award-winning release of the world's first home entertainment video of computer animation,","title":"State of the Art of Computer Animation","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2}
