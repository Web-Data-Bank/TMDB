Set in a garden paradise, designed to provide the perfect conditions for a group of rescued hedgehogs to thrive, the film follows a cast of prickly characters as they prepare for their return to the wild.  We'll spy on Max’s noisy courtship and Spike's bristling battles. We'll peek inside Amber's cosy nest as she tends to her precious new-borns and watch some intrepid youngsters take their first steps outside. As the hotel’s cameras capture this compelling hedgehog soap opera they'll also reveal remarkable insights into its spiky residents.  With numbers in steep decline, each hedgehog guest must grow fit and well enough to survive beyond the hotel grounds. As we follow their progress, this film will unlock their enchanting private lives and celebrate this humble but iconic British animal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":66389,"logo_path":"/ewSYWqmrOst8pEyFu1w2dG0EP9T.png","name":"Endemol","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hedgehog Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
