Just then, a wizard appears out of thin air in need of some snake sweat for a magical potion. Blue Racer refuses to help, but the wizard entices him by offering to grant him three wishes. Intrigued, Blue Racer wishes he had wings. The wizard obliges, but a little courting escapade, an encounter with Crazylegs Crane, and the rescue of a small chick make Blue Racer realize that life as a winged blue snake isn't all it's cracked up to be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hLsoJOC5EIfl5nrCxJLVTPhwziY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8402,"logo_path":null,"name":"DePatie-Freleng Enterprises","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Aces Wild","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
