As the personal drama of these conflict-ridden characters unfolds against this gritty backdrop, love and friendship become mere baits, and relationships get sacrificed at the altar of political alignments. The darkness that rises from their souls threatens to envelope all that they hold precious. Until eventually, in the crescendo of increasing violence, the line between good and evil blurs, making it impossible to distinguish heroes from villains. Raajneeti is the story of Indian democracy. And its ugly underside. It is about politics. And beyond.","popularity":4.492,"poster_path":"/bZJeKk1vzekp2xfGecwYoUZGzoB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2320,"logo_path":"/nSAXfUCy16cNRiPlBMHeb700t9p.png","name":"UTV Motion Pictures","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":3873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walkwater Media","origin_country":""},{"id":19145,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prakash Jha Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2010-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Politics ... and Beyond","title":"Raajneeti","video":false,"vote_average":6.206,"vote_count":63}
