Josiane, alcoholic, recovers her sister Eloise at the psychiatric hospital. To protect her, she hides the situation at first, taking advantage of this summer to go camping wild. They will eventually unite to try to recover the house. Even if Eloise offers ideas without tail or head, Josiane supports it, not to trample the enthusiasm and dreams of his sister. Because of their eccentric behavior, the villagers look at them strangely. Only against all, the two sisters must overcome many obstacles to achieve their goal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A0eCVrXF3l2HUZLusOwFq75GdrB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72509,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sans Sou Cie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Été 85","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2}
