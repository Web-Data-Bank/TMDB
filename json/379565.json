It is happening nationally and locally. It is an ideology that manifests itself in graveyard desecrations, animal mutilations, human sacrifices and suicide. It categorically involves drug/ alcohol abuse, pornography, sexual perversion, physical/mental abuse, heavy metal music and drinking blood.  And it is highly organized. Satanic/Occult organizations (churches) have corporate charters, own buildings, maintain national/ international computer networks, publish magazines/newsletters and hire professional public relations firms to polish their public image. It is both generational and self-styled. Some groups are esoteric while others are pantheistic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1JcJX526uDu6FPBiDtpaM1Njy0J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THIS VIDEO SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED BY SMALL CHILDREN","title":"Kids And The Occult","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
