Inside, the girls are waiting at the food counter. Among them are underage mothers and others who are married. All of them ended up here after becoming involved in  crime. Drug dealing, assault, murder. Yet instead of cold-blooded criminals we discover friendly, warm young people who laugh, sing and cry together. Their close bonds have been forged by the troubled past they share. We learn of their fears of  having to return to the lives they once left behind. The documental camera is intimate but respectful, the resulting portraits are full of dignity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1UnysRqvQHkHLnqtyALaCiZN88L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oskouei Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2017-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sir, the judge told me today I was a  bastard.
