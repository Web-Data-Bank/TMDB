But in 1995, those benefits could not yet be reaped. Business was down, the B shows were cancelled. What could turn this around?  Vince hoped it would be a group of guys working at the top of his card…a group that became known as the clique. Kevin Nash will take us back to ’95 when the kliq was formed, and he was given the strap. But was he REALLY Vince’s “guy?” Join Kevin for a journey into this pivotal year as the kliq solidified their stranglehold on the WWE.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6jn2oTRdfqhV42tzAjuhW3hhaPk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":197,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timeline: The History of WWE – 1995 – As Told By Kevin Nash","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
