Both a social justice story and a personally driven narrative, the film chronicles this capital case from 1984 through 2004. With exclusive footage from two decades, the film frames the judicial and emotional response to a chilling crime - and the implications that reverberate from Hunt's conviction - against a backdrop of class and racial bias in the South and in the American criminal justice system.","popularity":1.271,"poster_path":"/xCzLoQaNWuFViAtcWY5BR5I5OzC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10369,"logo_path":null,"name":"Break Thru Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trials of Darryl Hunt","video":false,"vote_average":8.1,"vote_count":12}
