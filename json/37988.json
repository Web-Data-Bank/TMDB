And, just in case we miss the similarities of splattered blood mixed with outrageous incidents, the movie explicitly references PULP FICTION and has a comedic scene in which two guys argue about McDonald's hamburgers. Still, VARES - PRIVATE EYE, by director Aleksi Mäkelä, manages to be kind of fun even not especially original. The script has more characters than the screenwriter can handle, leaving the audience frequently confused about who is doing what and why. The two best scenes are one about a wacky wedding and another about a guy who answers a cell phone call while he is busy enjoying the pleasures of a sex parlor.","popularity":1.515,"poster_path":"/lRsGGco3dL7f1OJAVOaR32gQokM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6339,"logo_path":"/ufP8NkiJ9ScGLIKz7J25xKtmVvX.png","name":"Solar Films","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2004-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"That summer a woman was running with the devil and it rained more than ever…","title":"Vares: Private Eye","video":false,"vote_average":6.076,"vote_count":33}
