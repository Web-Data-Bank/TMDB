Two naked men on a white sofa. Yet it remains in the imagination.  Pansittivorakul is the most outspoken gay filmmaker in Thailand. Or in the whole of Southeast Asia, you could say. The fact that last year he received a Silpathorn Award, an official state prize for artists, was one of the few encouraging events in a country with a military regime and unpredictable censorship. The film is an ode to the male body. Two naked men on a white sofa. And a film maker who restrains himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iyuTE0M4xXg9ydyQiy6YrUriUfs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2007-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Middle-earth","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
