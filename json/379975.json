Setting out as a free collective in the early 70ies, soon the social experiment emerged as a totalitarian system, which, 20 years later, ended in a dramatic failure. Through the eyes of these children, the film looks back at the community and examines what has become of the children of this utopia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14547,"logo_path":"/ubSOjyWFqQG4E1kaJmvPdOQ52qR.png","name":"unafilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of the Commune","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
