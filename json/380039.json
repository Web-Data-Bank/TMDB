I underwent more treatments and operations than the unluckiest of Marvel heroes. But I am a normal teenager without any super powers. I have parents who are doing well, a little sister as unpleasant as a chemo session and I live in a boring suburb. Ok, it's true, I am walking on a tightrope in a storm and any fall will probably be fatal. But I love life ... Putting one foot before the other one is not enough for me anymore. I intend to my mark before bowing out.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aa7dFjrZfkVPnroLJljTxGjfYEF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
