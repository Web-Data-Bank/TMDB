We may recall great moments from other sports, but rarely are they remembered as an integral part of our lives as is baseball. Ask a Pittsburgh fan where he was for Bill Mazeroski's home run. Mention Bucky Dent to a New Yorker - or Bill Buckner to a resident of Boston. Is there a Toronto fan alive who wasn't jumping just as high as Joe Carter in 1993? Baseball is passed down from one generation to another in a patient process that, in some ways, never ends. It's been this way for more than a century and will undoubtedly continue for generations to come. Contained herein, are the most memorable moments from baseball's first 125 years, each moment guaranteed to kindle a reminder of a special time - a special place. That's what baseball is all about.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Official History of Baseball, Vol 1&2","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
