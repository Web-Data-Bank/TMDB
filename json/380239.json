The film records daily life behind the walls of one of these institutions, in which a hard-working staff of nannies, nurses and volunteers take care of about fifty children aged from a few months to twelve years. Filmed in cinema-verite style and based on observation, it explores the complex fabric of the diverse, transient community that lives isolated in this home away from home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pRbBiV3xFvykAYJCJP4OXJFJgaI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78331,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmSixteen","origin_country":""},{"id":78332,"logo_path":null,"name":"A\u0026G Films Media Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":29241,"logo_path":null,"name":"2|35","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2016-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Amharic","iso_639_1":"am","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Candies from Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
