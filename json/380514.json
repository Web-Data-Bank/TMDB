Now, remastered to pristine, make-your-eyeballs-bug-out condition, these 18 landmark Looney Toons spotlight Porky and pals in a plentitude of porcine cartoon perfection, including Pilgrim Porky's half-baked attempt to put duck on his Thanksgiving menu (Tom Turk and Daffy), followed by Porky as a wildly wacky wagon train scout (Wagon Heels). Then, there's Porky's ham-handed scheme to thwart a ravenous rodent with a robot cat (Mouse Menace), and our piggy protagonist as a clueless cop trying to evict vagrant Daffy from his department store digs (Riff Raffy Daffy). And th-th-th that's NOT all folks! There's further fun afoot with Porky, Elmer Fudd, Bunny and Claude and more in these swine-sational classics from animation's Golden Age!","popularity":0.663,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
