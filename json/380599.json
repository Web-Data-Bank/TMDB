He embarks on a tempestuous, soul-searching journey, seeking out the details of his mother's childhood in Poland. He does this as a way of understanding why she, a survivor of the Auschwitz and Majdanek death camps, abandoned him at the age of 10. This exciting, peripatetic personal odyssey takes him on a twofold mission to places most people tend to avoid - the searing flames of desire and the tranquil, mysterious forests of dark secrets.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xARPVF2KdStXoi8yRxW8lcpTl8o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2009-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Light","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
