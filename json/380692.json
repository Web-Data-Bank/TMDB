If our lives really matter. How our religion is relevant to this life. Today. We want to understand what significance this minute, hour, week, month, and year has to our lives. To our world. We need a God who cares about this life, in this world, right now. We want to understand why everything we think, everything we say, and everything we do matters. We don't want to just sit back and wait for something to happen or someday to come. We want to know if all the choices we make now will shape our world and lives for eternity. Because we want our lives to have meaning today, and our lives today to have meaning forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4nx5mZYrgg35mwZikiQZ8mPKYVz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do our lives even matter?","title":"Nooma Trees 003","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
