We often think about times in our past when things were different and want our lives to be like that again. Some of us have even come to believe that our best days may actually be behind us. But if we're in some way hung up on the past, what does that mean for our lives now? How are we and those around us affected if we're not fully present? If we're longing for the way things used to be, what does that really say about our understanding and appreciation of our lives today? Maybe we need to learn to embrace our past for what it is, in order to live our lives to the fullest, right here, right now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iTeIBAUyGT1KntwNNCW0fLHurQw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can we become so consumed with the past that we can't see the beauty of today?","title":"Nooma Today 017","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
