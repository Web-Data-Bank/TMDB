We learn from a young age that life is about winning and impressing. We pick up that our worth and value come from how good, how smart, and how skilled we are. So, we twist things in our favor, making us look like we have it all together. Every day we have the choice to prop up these false ideas about ourselves or to let go of them. Jesus invites these parts of us to die, the parts of us that tell us our worth comes from the things we say and do. Maybe it's only when we let these things die, that we truly begin to live.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n6gM9dDHB1cLLu6AoFsIyLohKnX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do we try so hard to be something we are not, that we miss out on how to truly live?","title":"Nooma Tomato 022","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
