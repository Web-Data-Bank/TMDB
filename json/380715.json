We are all here because some woman somewhere gave us life. Her pain, her effort, for our life. And when a mother gives like that to a child, she is showing us what God is like. But sometimes this part of God's nature is overlooked. A lot of us are comfortable with male imagery for God. But what about female imagery for God? Is God limited to a gender? Or does God transcend and yet include what we know as male and female? Maybe if we were more aware of the feminine imagery for God we would have a better understanding of who God is and what God is like.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":"/us5ZKW1HL8QDPlxjujRajhcAXGD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Why do we overlook the feminine characteristics of God?","title":"Nooma She 021","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
