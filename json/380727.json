And yet other times we've prayed or known someone that prayed and the situation changed. Does God answer prayer? Sometimes, but not all the time? Or does God always answer prayer and it's just that sometimes God says no? Some of us are angry with God for not answering the prayers we've prayed for years. Why did he answer their prayer but not ours? What if there's more to prayer than just God listening and answering? Maybe if we understood how Jesus prayed, our concepts and expectations of prayer would change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sRDRCXt6KimR7wpKwsu83ypDe5f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Does prayer really help?","title":"Nooma Open 019","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
