Why is it so much easier for us to live our lives with a lot of things going on all the time than to just be in silence? We're constantly surrounded with \"voices\" that are influencing us on how to think, feel, and behave. Movies, music, TV, Internet, cell phones, and a never-ending barrage of advertising. There's always something going on. Always noise in our lives. But maybe there's a connection between the amount of noise in our lives and our inability to hear God. If God sometimes feels distant to us, maybe it's not because he's not talking to us, but simply because we aren't really listening.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eDenIwb2zi7feYfCaygLACO31CN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Why are we so afraid of silence?","title":"Nooma Noise 005","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
