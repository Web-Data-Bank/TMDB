This release doesn't contain any additional bonus material, but with nearly three hours of music from many of the biggest names in British rock (most of which has never been seen in the United States), there's more than enough to satisfy discerning music fans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gWcWt1PHiyQ9EUWHeS0d5nx0EVd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 Years Later.... with Jools Holland","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
