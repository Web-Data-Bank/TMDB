Bonded by their dreams to fight social injustice and spread peace, this unlikely band of free-spirited idealists quickly transformed into a drug-smuggling empire and at the same time inadvertently invented the modern illegal drug trade. At the head of the Brotherhood, and the heart of this story, is the anti-capitalistic husband and wife team, who made it their mission to change the world through LSD.","popularity":1.633,"poster_path":"/pElD520j1jgANaPUIm6qkR4ThEY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of friends, family & one hundred million hits of acid","title":"Orange Sunshine","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":15}
