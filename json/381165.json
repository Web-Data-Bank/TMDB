Leo Peret has a small quiet tobacco shop in Greenwich Village. Edward Livingston, a wealthy young clubman and man-about-town, comes in frequently ostensibly to buy cigarettes but in reality to talk to the daughter Jeannette, and he is soon in love with the little shop girl. Leo is homesick for his native France, but lacks the funds to make the passage. Edward, learning of their plight, sends $1,000 with a note saying that the money is payment for a good deed. Leo accepts the money and he and Jeannette embark at once.","popularity":0.676,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artcraft Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Thing in Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
