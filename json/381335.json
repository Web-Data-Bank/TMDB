If Susanne back then could slowly overcome her concentration camp memories to prevent Hans from taking justice into his own hands, here Anna cannot forget that she couldn’t protect a strange boy in the mad final days of WWII when she was fleeing the approaching Soviet Army with her mother and younger brother. She’s a prisoner, caught in a timeloop in her head, it’s not an accident that her name is a palindrome.
