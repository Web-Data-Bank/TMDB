His father, a postman, is determined that his son--who has won a pre-med scholarship to UCLA--will become a doctor. The eighteenth birthday party of Ben's sister, Rose, sets off a comedic and touching series of events and family struggles that will in turn determine young Ben's future. This fresh independent production from Gene Cajayon presents a lighthearted and warm coming-of-age tale filtered through the eyes of an American subculture rarely seen on film.","popularity":1.198,"poster_path":"/cTw0nHlXT2Wa2J1ilBrvAMnXDSO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139944,"logo_path":"/AhidH8FFYTAzexStLcJNQg2Tree.png","name":"Center for Asian American Media (CAAM)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":151087,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Asian American Telecommunications Association","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One night can change a lifetime.","title":"The Debut","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
