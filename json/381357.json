At her eyes, she continues to exhibit sharpness and precision in the very demanding art and skill of tattooing. The second layer shows her many stories as woman who has reached the age of looking back. She regales us with stories of her many suitors, of her youth, the dancing and the feasts. She also looks back with not just a tinge of regret that she never married nor had children of her own. Her body covered in tattoos is a landscape on its own mirroring the map of a woman who has chosen wittingly or unwittingly a road diverging from convention and in the process became a culture-bearer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/owlDhv6azR6y6SUFIxt7TBHsdus.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57621,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Development Council of the Philippines","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Documentary Film about Fang Od","title":"The Woman Behind the Tattoo Artist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
