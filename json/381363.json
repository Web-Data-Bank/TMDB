In fact, \"Every Pixel Tells a Story\" is an example of what can be accomplished on digital video. Producer-director Peter Hanson shot and edited the movie in a matter of weeks using a camcorder, a computer editing system, and a $30 microphone from Radio Shack, all while spending a fraction of what the documentary would have cost had it been shot on film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Pixel Tells a Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
