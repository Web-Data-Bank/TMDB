FAR END OF THE MILKY WAY is a trip to the periphery of society. Wealth and jobs are scarce around here, but people want to stay regardless. With stubbornness and a sense of humor, they make the best of their situation. FAR END OF THE MILKY WAY is a film about work and love, your garden as your pub, ashes in the snow and slaughtering pigs","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rohfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Far End of the Milky Way","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
