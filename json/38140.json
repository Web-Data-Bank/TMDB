Emilio's friend Alejandro, who sells pirated DVDs, has assembled a team of amateurs, who, as Alejandro says, will go unnoticed because they're immigrants. The team must gain entry to Silvestrini's well-guarded mansion, steal two keys to access a vault, and then get the money off the property. A father and his tomboy daughter, a nervous Cuban actor, a techie, and a muscle man make up the team, plus Alejandro has been courting Silvestrini's nanny. Will they be enough?","popularity":3.864,"poster_path":"/px4hQ1HvJBDSzRuY3zNIkrFTlrd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Narrow Bridge Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2007-08-31","revenue":6,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Rob a Thief","video":false,"vote_average":7.426,"vote_count":81}
