In the central area of the former military training ground, hunting will soon be prohibited. For the hunting grounds in the area, this is quite an imposition: the populations of red deer, fallow deer and wild boar, limited only with great effort, will get out of control. Nor will the return of the wolf change anything – according to the hunters in the area, the wolf has no place here, anyway. The film accompanies three hunters in their forests and in long, tranquil shots provides insights into the hidden world behind hunting terminology and loden coats.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wWrB9elR85spaEnhjmnKykICUzy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wüste Film West","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grenzbock","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
