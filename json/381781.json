For many, the sight of a girl shredding a guitar or laying into the drums is still a bit of a novelty. As soon as women started forming their own bands they were given labels - the rock chick, the girl band or one half of the rock 'n' roll couple.  Kate Mossman aims to look beyond the cliches of fallen angels, grunge babes and rock chicks as she gets the untold stories from rock's frontline to discover if it has always been different for the girl in a band.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3W1VcRNLvcVCauEKCVxVzy6zjXK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl in a Band: Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Front Line","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
