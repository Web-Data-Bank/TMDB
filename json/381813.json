Director Richard Newtonâ€™s perspective on the love triangle between JFK, Jackie O., and Marilyn Monroe. When Mary Lynne (Monroe) overdoses on a bowl of Phenobarbital Cheerios, Johnny (JFK) and Jackie hop the Greyhound and head for Tijuana.

Along the way, he introduces them to the Greek Gods and a succession of unusual erotic acts, each of which culminates in a slo-mo re-enactment of the Zapruder film.","popularity":0.916,"poster_path":"/c4eCc3m6KFj10skhz6Cnn22zwI6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small White House","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
