I am.” “The Bad Boy of Bowling,” directed by Bryan Storkel, explores the meaning of that schizophrenic shout, uttered for a national television audience right after he won an unprecedented fifth U.S. Open title. He’s the one-time wunderkind son of Dick Weber, the matinee idol of bowling in its heyday. He’s the mullet-wearing PDW who gave much-needed energy to a dying sport with his “crotch shots.” He’s a wise guy who has wised up—at least a little. In this entertaining but piercing roll down memory lane, viewers will discover just who Pete Weber really is.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rY9CPwJGLULD5pKnJROZCAGQz13.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":116538,"logo_path":"/n5d2MXzCcyG0FSbfQClp6fVrDJV.png","name":"Sidestilt Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bad Boy of Bowling","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
