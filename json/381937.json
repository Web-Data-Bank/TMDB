From the balcony of his home, the director films with a small camera the changes in his neighborhood and his own family, interweaving his images with extracts from classical films to illustrate the parallels between the Armenian genocide and Syrians’ reality today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Houses Without Doors","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":4}
