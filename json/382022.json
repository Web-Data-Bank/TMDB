It is essentially focused on three major voices, soprano, tenor and baritone, with a basso to spice it up. New Yorker Evan Bowers may not be a matinee idol, but he sails into the role with a bright, focused lyrico spinto tenor voice. Renato Bruson was 72 years old in 2008, when he took this role (first sung by him in1989) and it shows, with quite a wobble on many passages; yet his voice commands the stage and rises majestically in the ensembles. And then, Bulgarian Svetla Vassileva, who is not burned at the stake, as in “Maid”, but dies heroically in battle.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":"/pzvnia79JOeEvcOhzVYiTSYxu09.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42411,"logo_path":"/9osTYTduHkM6Il6XixUTfdNcaoP.png","name":"C Major Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2008-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giovanna d'Arco","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
