The trio of principals: Ribeiro, Lungu, and Dalla Benetta , offer youthful exhuberance and intensity, good looks and glorious voices. The rest of the cast is equally good. Superb conductor, traditional production, great staging. Anf of course, Verdi’s exquisite music. It has renovated my faith in the totality of the Verdi canon, not only its most performed titles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nwtLAenJythWWgs5CSmEOHdoWiY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42411,"logo_path":"/9osTYTduHkM6Il6XixUTfdNcaoP.png","name":"C Major Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2008-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il corsaro","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
