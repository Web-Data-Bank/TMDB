This film is a tribute to the 18 million men, women and children who made the torturous journey from the Old to the New World between 1890 and 1920, in the single largest migration in human history. The film radically tells the immigrants' stories as they braved the unknown, from the time they left their homelands, their journey across the ocean, to the moment the doors of Ellis Island opened, revealing the great promise of America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rfFa3Qynes8ui21nIIsoB9luBZK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79919,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guggenheim Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island of Hope, Island of Tears","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
