That's certainly what Bobby, Shannon, and the gang thought when they set off on an adventure of a lifetime. But when their truck breaks down in the middle of night, in the middle of nowhere without phone signal, they have no option to but to seek refuge in a creepy old mansion. Welcomed to spend the night by the brother and sister who live alone in the old house - very strange things begin to occur! As the local cops don't seem to want to help and are equally as odd as the gang's brother and sister hosts - the five friends have to keep their wits and sanity about them and hatch an ingenious plan, as the road-trip adventure rapidly turns into whirlwind of spooks and crazy mysterious goings-on.","popularity":1.215,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friday Download: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
