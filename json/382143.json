With her Louise Brooks-like tomboyish looks she drags herself, chain-smoking, from one job to another until she appears to find her niche as a truck driver. Although she has female lovers she does not form a bond with any of them; instead she clashes, time and again, venting herself in wordless emotional outbursts and other behavioural extremes.","popularity":3.621,"poster_path":"/tmtu6NAvyVYZzreAj8dqigBFHe7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29285,"logo_path":null,"name":"FRAME100R","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":73008,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mediabrigade","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":119224,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Balance","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":29284,"logo_path":null,"name":"love.FRAME","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":75190,"logo_path":null,"name":"ALEF Film \u0026 Media Group","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":6242,"logo_path":"/t2DxIOeTikEe9YTckWuFJECoG9r.png","name":"Barrandov Studio","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":119227,"logo_path":"/rRiodckSm2scJ5bDO2F6p9xEQXQ.png","name":"Spoon","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":118811,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Samuelson Lighting Prague","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":16906,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arizona Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2016-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I, Olga Hepnarova","video":false,"vote_average":6.859,"vote_count":46}
