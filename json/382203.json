He can't help but crank out the occasional false note, just often enough to enrage his listeners and discourage any donations. He dreams of playing a large pipe organ. The juke box drowns him out at a cocktail bar, a church organ drowns him out on a street, pinball machines drown him out at Luna Park. The city's neon lights and commercial posters overwhelm his small art. At the end of the day, he captures the tear of a calliope horse - his sole earnings for the day - which may prove magical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zjEfochqCGd8ieyrzOfBS17c7fP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61468,"logo_path":null,"name":"Absolon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The False Note","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
