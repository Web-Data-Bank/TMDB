The graffiti community is predominantly a man's world, and men often share the view that graffiti – namely the illegal kind – is not for girls. And yet women have become increasingly more emancipated in recent years; there are female graffiti shows, magazines and websites. Girl Power captures the stories of ladies who have succeeded in the male graffiti world.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/rjRiL1JYLVGMyTVsos3sieUHR4j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":56573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Punk Film","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2016-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film you could never shoot if you were not a graffiti writer.","title":"Girl Power","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
