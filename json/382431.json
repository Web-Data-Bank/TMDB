La Rinconada is situated over 5,000 meters high in the Peruvian Andes, on the edge of a gold mine. This 21st century El Dorado is an inhospitable place, where untold numbers of people live and work in the most precarious of conditions, hoping both for gold and a better life. Salomé Lamas has constructed a cinematic diptych to convey the extremity of this situation and the dimensions of its misery without having to resort to graphic images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/87TPmxGroe9pikBZUNjCzwfcqCj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shellac Sud","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":9020,"logo_path":"/qAcfiiC2WPGrfotZPnoHkDtQ6lr.png","name":"O Som e a Fúria","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2016-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eldorado XXI","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
