Back then, she lambasted him for being wrong for the job. Back then, he let slip that she isn’t actually crazy. Now she’s a prostitute living in precarious circumstances in Los Angeles and is accused of murder, with her memories once again moving inexorably towards a fire. Sanada assesses her in the presence of an investigator who appears not to understand Japanese. Is Azusa now mentally ill for real? Was she back then? And why does the description of her tormentors upset him so?","popularity":0.63,"poster_path":"/pZnJnbqMfuliG43L3ypO62O03nq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85640,"logo_path":null,"name":"KATSU-do","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":147313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yoshimoto Creative Agency","origin_country":""},{"id":17828,"logo_path":"/g0qJBMunT2lnlHEw5opkCRcMOgR.png","name":"Booster Project","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hee","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
