Edit also has a job at a scientific and social research company, in taking care of Abel Mustafov, an autistic math genius who discovered a formula that connects all forces in the world, but no computer was able to calculate it fully without becoming self-aware and shutting down immediately after that. After Edit sees the formula graph, the chip calculates the formula, and becomes able to \"survive\" thanks to its connection to Edit. It develops a parallel personality and affords her abilities greater than she ever imagined.","popularity":3.483,"poster_path":"/wSGbVkWZEl3556M1bia8rk5jWnn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52878,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yodi Movie Craftsman","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2009-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Meet your new hero.
