In the film story, Japan's marine regiment protects Japanese residents and Chinese refugees-women and young children-from rampant street fighting, Shanhai Rikusentai unsparingly uses its first eight minutes for an official-mannered self-justification of the war. From the viewpoint of explaining Japan's military operation,the narration refers to the city s spatial division in sync with maps on screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fFbIzS6ZFsfsHCUo6xjYkznXxC9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toho Film (Eiga) Co.
