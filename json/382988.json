A considerable portion of the art-themed movies made around the world often takes place in an intellectual atmosphere. These works are hence movies that reflect the theoretical 'high' art debate the elites deal with. Our movie rather depicts the warm relation between a surreal sculpture and those who live in slums and outskirts. In other words, it is the story of understanding and benefiting as much as possible fro 'Chaos' by those who see and render the world through their own dim window, who try to save the day with their ordinary calculations.","popularity":0.875,"poster_path":"/6dDrJu1l4pw8OUCcE5ecdgpePCR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180230,"logo_path":"/c7PpqOTBFr63U1tuVuSJG9FUG7G.png","name":"Barakuda Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2014-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guruldayan Kalpler","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
