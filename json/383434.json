The two main subjects in the film are a Sarajevo family whose young daughter is killed a day after she is filmed in a dance competition; and an 8 year old girl, Amira, whose eye witness account of murder and rape becomes a diary of catharsis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gd0frav1x7BOIOAbil1HfxKRI3g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Exile Productions Pty.
