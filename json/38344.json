For the first time in his life, he is without a job or a sense of direction, and he's too proud to ask for guidance. His best mates - rascally Danny, timid Norman and cynical Eddie - are there for him, but Frank still feels desperately alone. An offhand remark from Danny inspires Frank to challenge himself. Already contemplating the state of his relationships with loving wife Joan and all-but-estranged son Rob, Frank is determined to shore up his own self-confidence. He will attempt the near impossible - swimming the English Channel.","popularity":2.95,"poster_path":"/gE2TRj270Z4KJ5tjSnhpROBwxIH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":980,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Glasgow Film Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":19191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baker Street","origin_country":""},{"id":9321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forthcoming Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-08-18","revenue":878122,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Anything is possible","title":"On a Clear Day","video":false,"vote_average":6.38,"vote_count":25}
