Following a 40-minute SAVATAGE set and a 40-minute TSO set, TSO and SAVATAGE band members, across two of the festival's main stages, performed a perfectly coordinated set of fan favorites. This ambitious feat, both musically and logistically, was helmed by Paul O'Neill. Al Pitrelli led TSO on the \"True Metal Stage\" and Jon Oliva headed SAVATAGE on the \"Black Stage.\" Beyond the unprecedented act of two bands hitting the stage at the same time, this show was also memorable as it marked progressive metal originators SAVATAGE's first show in over a decade, TSO's first European festival show, as well as the only live appearances of both bands in Europe in 2015.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pGKtV4sK14w4Y9A1ToY6y5Q0lhq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trans-Siberian Orchestra & Savatage: Wacken Open Air 2015","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
