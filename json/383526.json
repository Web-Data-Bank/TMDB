Whilst Pablo blithely studies dance, Juan is hoping that, after twenty-five years at the firm, his boss will consider him for a partnership. When Pablo is badly wounded in a brutal homophobic attack which sees him hospitalised, his father realises just how far they have become estranged. A lack of witnesses and expensive medical bills force Juan to leave the quiet stability of his life for good and reposition himself in a world where there is discrimination. Time and again his efforts come to nought, until one night on the streets of Santiago he makes up his own rules in order to save his son.","popularity":1.061,"poster_path":"/oq7Ybz4DlGrJvW7cutsw1zHaVN4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88833,"logo_path":null,"name":"5AM Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":73385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Araucaria Cine","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2016-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You'll Never Be Alone","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":27}
