These playmates from childhood are now going through an embarrassing age of adolescence. They get together once again at high school and return to their almamater paying a visit to their teacher. Their reunion goes wonderfully until one of them drowns. Their teacher's husband gets killed while attempting to save the students. In their early 20s, most of them graduated from college and subsequently start their first jobs. Some of them start their career early, some decide to study abroad, and others get married. As for their teacher, she devotes herself to \"special education\" following in her husband's footsteps. When they are reunited at the age of 40, each of them has experienced different trials of life. In search of good old memories of childhood, they gather together again to walk the corridors of their almamater.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j54W1UKP7wzYbhyN7sEXGkhocbh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1986-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reunion","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
