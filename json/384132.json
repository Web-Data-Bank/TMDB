The plan was aimed at fighting a war on 2 fronts against Russia and France. Von Molkte changed the plan when he replaced Schlieffen but the essentials were the same. Both plans were based on the following assumptions,Russia would take at least 6 weeks to mobilise,France would be easily defeated in 6 weeks, Belgium would not resist any German attack and Britain would remain neutral.All these assumptions were wrong and the new plan did not work. This film explains in detail why it failed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Battlefield History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Schlieffen Plan","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
