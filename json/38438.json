Alphonse Tram is unwittingly involved in several murders despite having no memory of committing the crimes. His confusion lead him to confess to his neighbour, Inspector Morvandieu. Alphonse and Morvandieu become the axis around which murders occur.","popularity":6.038,"poster_path":"/bFqksOyHGMRlcUI5NtHDp9LqOUq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1117,"logo_path":"/2X2uFeObxawiAajNDOf3Mhri5Wg.png","name":"Antenne 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sara Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buffet Froid","video":false,"vote_average":7.115,"vote_count":240}
