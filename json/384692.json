This is a fully dramatised film, which captures the essence of Paddington, not only by striking visuals of the Old-Sydney architecture in the area, but by re-enacting the mood and lifestyle of some typical, bohemian inhabitants. Scripted by Joan Long. Music by Grahame Bond and Rory O'Donaghue. Starring Ross Thompson, Janne Wesley and Ron Blanchard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paddington Lace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
