China and apprises her of the fact that Lord Thurlow sails on the same ship and is to act as her escort. At the same time telling her he will meet them at Cape Town. After a hurried preparation for the departure the long journey is begun. Lord Thurlow is attentive to his charge that he may fulfill the wishes of his friend and confidant, John Wilton. Will Carson, a fellow passenger aboard, much admires the young and handsome Helen and seeks an introduction through the ship officer. The admiration becomes mutual and they are seen on the promenade deck enjoying fresh sea air. Their action causes much uneasiness on the part of Lord Thurlow, who interferes in the discharge of his duty, and is in turn insulted by Will, much to the disgust of Helen, who regrets the publicity of the incident. The approaching storm rivets the attention of all on board and for a time the unfortunate affair is forgotten.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8c7L2t1amRwkzLu7HqqIrr5sibo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to the Primitive","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
