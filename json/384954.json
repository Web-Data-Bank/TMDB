Almost four years in the making, Maidens picked up local and international short film awards and became compulsory viewing in women and film courses around the country -- where it sparked much impassioned debate. It remains essential viewing for an enhanced understanding of the moment of awakened consciousness that characterised 1970s feminism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5RNBvy1LCagfXg3GrvrvWgixsij.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":417,"logo_path":"/w7d3hoHQaC0XwjrxEG1yPeuUhu5.png","name":"Australian Film Commission","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":147226,"logo_path":"/2vo7KiWQ6y04UJSoa8iMfvDX6ry.png","name":"National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA)","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1978-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maidens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
