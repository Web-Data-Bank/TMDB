His journeys began in December, 1911 when he joined Mawson's expedition to Antarctica as official photographer; his stills of the Expedition were widely published around the world and this documentary \"Home of the Blizzard\" was released in 1913.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home of the Blizzard","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
