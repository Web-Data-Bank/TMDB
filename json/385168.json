It’s the story of a woman’s transformation into her true self, and a wild chase by her friends to find the woman that they think they’ve lost. Among her group of friends Rachel is seen as the wallflower, but all of that changes when a chance encounter turns into sex so hot it lasts an entire day, and well into the night. Coming home one night Rachel’s roommate spots her car, but without her driving, and assumes the worst: that Rachel has been murdered by the handsome man behind the wheel. Setting out to find her she unwittingly sets a series of events into motion. We watch as all of her friends join the hunt, and one by one find themselves in their own little dreams, driving LA’s lonely streets and meeting lovers that will propel them to the heights of ecstasy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vQVwWdNUlPEeIZvcC6DiQBNquk0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/pXHXO1qKuQEDv8NDvoNmSaV4gvi.png","name":"Wicked Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Just drive,\" she said.","title":"Red Light","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
