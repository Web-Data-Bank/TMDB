Mayakovskiy is the star; his occasional presence holds together a film driven by the sound, the beat, of his poetry. Evteeva develops a dramatic structure of flaring, fading, being from light: violin strings become rays, quivering dull yellow spots, pictures. The plot assails the material from which it derives energy from material. History, growling and roaring, finds its form.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4G2jSVQsmxE59KZzhbW2U0pZH3e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Horse, the Violin and a Little Bit Nervous","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
