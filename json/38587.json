He chases one pesky rat inside the house, and shoots a hole in the floor, which he falls through, into a vat of home-brew. With the cat thus away, the rats play, at first dancing and singing, and later playing in the bathtub. The cat eventually sobers up (after he lands in a cactus), and tries to blow up the rats (and house!) with a bomb, but the rats plant the bomb on the cat, who blows up himself, Alice, and several nearby trees.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yxuJqBlu7D8A6IbQOVFZ6791kaC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice Rattled by Rats","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":9}
