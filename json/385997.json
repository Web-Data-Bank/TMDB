Farrell McDonald, cast as a chronic gambler named Coburn. When the old man loses every penny he has, wandering cowboy Pokey (King) comes to the rescue by grooming a wild stallion for a successful racetrack career. Everything comes to a head during the climactic Big Race, with the expected (but still satisyfing) results. Ruth Reece and Joan Barclay share the leading-lady responsibilities, while the villainy is in the capable hands of Monogram's ace utility actor Craig Reynolds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iRgE7TwykaRIPHseasrxSHKWAUx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73947,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden West","origin_country":""},{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...the king of wild horse races to glory against thoroughbreds of the turf...","title":"The Gentleman from Arizona","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
