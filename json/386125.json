In December 2011, Berlin venue Haus der Kulturen der Welt held a symposium on the topic of the current state of our democracy. The speakers’ appraisal is shocking: the Euro crisis and so-called best alternative to ‘save the markets’ means that the poker game over our common currency has taken precedence over visionary politics and institutions and parliamentarians are reduced to playing extras in a hectic race against time. Professing themselves to being at the mercy of practical constraints, politicians are at the same time using this line of argument to legitimise the dismantling of justice, freedom and solidarity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pantera Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Democracy Under Attack - An Intervention","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
