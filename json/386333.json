This movie is filled with the footage that was deemed unfit for Fall Out Boy's \"My Heart Will Always Be The B-Side To My Tongue\" and goes way beyond the original DVD to give you a closer look at the band's inner circle. Includes footage on everything from the early years to backstage antics, reckless stunts, and live footage of \"Armor For Sleep\", \"Gym Class Heroes\", and many more. Also contains clips from Fall Out Boy in Japan, their summer tour, and the near riot during their Detroit Warped Tour performance in 2004.","popularity":1.208,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":148710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clandestine Industries","origin_country":""},{"id":148714,"logo_path":null,"name":"ONE UP Production","origin_country":""},{"id":148715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Wentz / Bartskull Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Release the Bats","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
