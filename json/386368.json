The story suggests that these bridges were designed to prevent the passage of buses, thereby only allowing people who could afford to own a car to access Long Islandâ€™s leisure spaces. The film investigates the story and the ongoing academic debate that it spurred through interviews with four scholars who in the 1980s and 1990s discussed interpretations of the design. The questions that the film raises engage with issues of secrecy and control, the morals of power and the effects of technology.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74026,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Centre for Architecture","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Misleading Innocence (Tracing What a Bridge Can Do)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
