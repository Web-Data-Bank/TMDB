No one helps anybody else. But then, shortly before Basti attempts to commit suicide, before he jumps from Vienna's Reichsbr√ºcke into the notoriously gluttonous Danube, something happens between the two young protagonists. Basti and Claudia meet on the bridge. Two bungee jumpers without a cord. They both recognize themselves in the other's life, between reform school and the family's butcher shop, between child abuse and games that involve getting tied up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bKlTetV6k5JreNXGoEYR0aUsW3l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alma Film Produktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donauleichen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
