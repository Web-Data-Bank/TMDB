The meeting assents and decides that the order of her rotation should be established by lot. The two bachelors of the village claim their right to the home help as well, arguing that they are also taxpayers. When Elsa Haglund arrives from Gothenburg she starts her first week of work at one of the two bachelors, the village shop-keeper Sjökvist. He is immediately infatuated by her and begins a flirtation. At the end of the week Elsa happens to meet the other bachelor, Eric Broo, called \"the singing farmer\". She falls in love with him, but doesn't know how to hook him, as he is very shy and unskilled in courting women. In the meantime Åsa-Nisse, the village rogue, carries out some of his pranks.","popularity":0.771,"poster_path":"/dZVdKo4IoGlQ2gJ7fa5XDC9bIv6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Svensk Talfilm","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1949-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Åsa-Nisse","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":6}
