The three of us saw Kazem Ala, an Iranian student and political exile, briefly interviewed on a local cable access show in Austin, Texas and were very moved by his story. We spent a month filming his day to day life in Houston, during the Iranian-American hostage crisis of 1980. The film was meant to describe in subtle ways what it is to be a political exile in times of political crisis.  PBS found it to be a little too subtle, and declined to air it nationally, but the film was televised on various individual PBS outlets,  and seeing it recently, I was struck by how, a generation later, we're still dealing with this same situation  - the clash between Islam and the West.  The Presidents and Ayatollahs may have changed, but politically, things are still at crisis level. - Ross McElwee","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resident Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
