With its bucking bronchos, pitching mustangs, bucking steers, and the biggest novelty ever, the acme of all thrillers, \"see Bud bulldog a steer.\" Only three men have successfully accomplished this feat and lived to tell about it. Then Bud receives a shock. The local operator appears with a telegram. \"Your Uncle John dead. You are sole heir to his estate valued at several millions. Come to Chicago at once.\" The astounded cowboys tumble over with sheer amazement. Bud buys and the scene closes with a characteristic rush for the bar.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gdUVeS0oSFYCJ0aIZsgwBbEGxV1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1909-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cowboy Millionaire","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
