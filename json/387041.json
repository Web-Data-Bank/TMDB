It will be remembered that Major Gladwynn, Commandant of Fort Detroit in 1763, had declared his love for a young Indian girl and she had become much attached to him. At this period Pontiac was at the height of his power and had sent emissaries about the villages of the Ottawas inciting war against the whites. The final plan involved the entry to the fort of a number of picked chieftains, each carrying a shortened gun beneath his blanket. The mission was ostensibly to be one of peace, but at a signal from Pontiac the chieftains were to drop their blankets and to massacre the whites.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zOPWvpkW2lnnd6cBaWmnHtHVCKH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Conspiracy of Pontiac","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
