What started as a small video project and have grown into a team of racers, a line of bikes produced with Cinelli, and an outlet for friends to support each other through bikes. The accompanying video takes a narrower view than the book, focusing primarily on street-riding in San Francisco. With exceptional riding and up-close cinematography, the video captures the joy of riding track bikes in a city like SF and passes that excitement along.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10595,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mash Transit Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mash SF","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
