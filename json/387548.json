What started as an off-beat idea for a party ended with National Guard troops expelling the revelers from Zap and the nearby towns of Beulah and Hazen, creating a national media sensation.  Zap Revisited, a film by West Fargo native Christ Breitling, recalls the strange-but-true story of the \"Zip to Zap\", aka the \"Zap-In\", through the memories of people who were there and took part in this uniquely infamous episode in North Dakota history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74235,"logo_path":null,"name":"Outcast Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Stranger this have happened...\"","title":"Zap Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
