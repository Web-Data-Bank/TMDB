As the childless pair humorously adjust to their new surroundings, they soon spend more time concentrating on conceiving than in searching for the talented canine. The subdued, reflective Land of the Singing Dog was screened as part of the Director's Fortnight at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of the Singing Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
