This breezy story based on an comedy unreleased in Italy at that time is built around Ruggeri, who plays the role of a playboy father who wants to turn into the family delights rejoining his son until then neglected. Novelli, a little uncomfortable in a role that would have required ten years less, is the good-hearted rustic son. Pina Menichelli, adorned with flowers, wanders about on her bicycle, between not only two men, but also two lifestyles. In this role, she shows off a naturalness that will surprise people who know her only for her decadent performances. Sometimes, though, a dark glimpse reveals the character of the actress, that will stand out in the imagination of the public.","popularity":0.981,"poster_path":"/lGk8UlHJOiaY9T8jUHsHPXiNfae.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1915-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Papà","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":3}
