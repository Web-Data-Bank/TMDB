Filmed by Takehisa Kosugi's mentor Matsu Ohno (perhaps best known in the States for his sound effects/score work on the television series Astro-Boy), the film moves at the same pace as the music itself, a pastoral road movie following a band far more likely to play temples than clubs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Tour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
