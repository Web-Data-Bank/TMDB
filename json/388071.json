When Charles, the strip-club emcee, brings his blind brother Jean (Jean-Jacques Benhamou) to work, Lucie starts a relationship with him, just for the perverse reason that he can never see her even though she is on view for any paying customer. Jean recently lost his eyesight in an accident, and is bitter and possibly suicidal.
