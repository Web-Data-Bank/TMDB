The trio spend their days listening to endless homemade tapes that teach them a whole new vocabulary. Any word that comes from beyond their family abode is instantly assigned a new meaning. Hence 'the sea' refers to a large armchair and 'zombies' are little yellow flowers. Having invented a brother whom they claim to have ostracized for his disobedience, the uber-controlling parents terrorize their offspring into submission.","popularity":14.256,"poster_path":"/7nLuUGlH12cegPfR84QX4xIIH9k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/x5m947rMvwJbNpoGil5W76dIJjB.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":15113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boo Productions","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":15115,"logo_path":"/8F9YG6tWPHEkVCXRVbC6aq3ENMz.png","name":"Horsefly Productions","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2009-06-01","revenue":110197,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The cat is the most feared animal there is!","title":"Dogtooth","video":false,"vote_average":7.121,"vote_count":1866}
