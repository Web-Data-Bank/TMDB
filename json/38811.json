They assume a life of poverty in Mexico in an attempt to teach him a lesson. However, he discovers it's a ruse, but continues to perpetuate the facade of ignorance while sneaking off during the day to conduct his thriving business. Why? To teach his family a lesson - they are all lazy, worthless leeches!","popularity":1.735,"poster_path":"/fBXUXJFzrXx2ggbMQGtjLUZNPCE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ultramar Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1949-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Madcap","video":false,"vote_average":6.983,"vote_count":30}
