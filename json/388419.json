Life is grand on the surface, but it becomes exponentially harder to maintain Angela's plush lifestyle, especially on the salary of a local cable installer. A few illegal transactions with Angela's short tempered Uncle Frankie, and Big George, an obese drug dealer with a penchant for illicit chemistry, and Ray manages to stumble upon the American Dream - South Florida style. Ray's fantasies, religious rearing, a horny groupie, and unrequited love for a thought provoking bi-sexual named Sara are causing him to question his life and morality. In the end Ray will have to deal with insurmountable fear, passion, and nagging guilt as he questions; is this life really worth living?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Man's Tale","title":"Sex and Guilt","video":true,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
