Ice cream drips from its cone, a father photographs his child. Then a man suddenly arrests his focus. Inspired by a picture from photographer Juan Medina, taken on the beach of Gran Tarajal in Spain in 2006, director Ronny Trocker animates a situation that happened today as it did yesterday, with the difference that today, no one moves. Time is frozen. A black man lies exhausted on the shore. It seems that no one has noticed his arrival.","popularity":0.686,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":81068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stempel Films","origin_country":""},{"id":12434,"logo_path":"/9rfMaAC5f84cCmmVmYv29nGkdY1.png","name":"Autour de Minuit","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
