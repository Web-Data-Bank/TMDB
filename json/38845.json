The second segment is about an ordinary man named Albert Einstein (\"the only Albert Einstein not to have discovered the Theory of Relativity\") whose hands have a life of their own, staying out late at night, misbehaving and committing adultery with feet. The third segment â€“ hasn't much story to it at all, and instead concerns the inhabitants of the moving pictures on an over-sized Christmas card, who interact with each other in all sorts of bizarre ways.","popularity":1.078,"poster_path":"/u7jxcwi6Ld1RIR9YTIF1iCZN3jg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1979-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Storytime","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":21}
