Eventually, the girl (on the advice of friends) turns the tables on him, and claims to have outside relationships of her own. This prompts him to move out in a huff, into the flat of a casual conquest of his, but he soon discovers that his poor manners have resulted in his not being welcome anywhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleepy Betrayers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
