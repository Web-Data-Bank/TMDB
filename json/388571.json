Maria is just as girl who can't say \"Nein,\" thus she goes through several lovers before the plot proper gets underway. When Maria finally falls in love for real, it is with repressed astronomer Robert Duessler. Afraid to make physical contact, Duessler prefers to gaze at Maria from a distance through his telescope. Not surprisingly, the film's title translates to Mary of the Stars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yTbnANli4wzfM8Gs9ux6gPreKM7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1989-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria von den Sternen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
