Literally sold to a master teacher, Sergei Rippas (Tarmo Manni) by his mother when he was still a child, the violin prodigy was forcefully and strictly raised to practice, practice, and perfect his technique. Once an adult, Arsi finds a way to escape the rigors of a U.S. tour and drowns his overworked self in drink, or seeks out one-night stands, or otherwise lets off steam. The tightly-wound spring that has been coiled since he was forced into his grueling training and work sessions -- shown through symbolic images -- eventually snaps in a healthy way, freeing Arsi at last to continue on, simply for the love of music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qOpmTjHV74StdTmtybSzfobeL6w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmTeknik","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2396,"logo_path":"/v0U7OZwjgv2vmiHbS2HNqjX9MEc.png","name":"Finnish Film Foundation","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":1728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandrews","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":120360,"logo_path":null,"name":"P-Kino","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1985-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Da Capo","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
