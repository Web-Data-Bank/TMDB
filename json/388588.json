The boy, Tim (Andrew Hawley), also acts as a go-between for his friend Carns (Liam Neeson) who is having an affair with a married woman (Miranda Richardson). Eventually, things start to sort themselves out, and Tim sees life getting more interesting when he and his friend Win (Kate Foster) slowly get a relationship going.","popularity":1.375,"poster_path":"/s6NGT6qmNykzTpb9CLnsyqYpRXY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tempest Films Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":10981,"logo_path":null,"name":"TVS Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1985-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Innocent","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
