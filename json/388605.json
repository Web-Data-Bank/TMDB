At that time, supporters of an independent Quebec began to consolidate their power under the Parti Québecois -- and the story of Louis and his wife Claudette are meant to illustrate this watershed in Quebec's history. As the film begins, Claudette and Louis are about to get married -- and their wedding day significantly coincides with preparations for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II. Years later, they are well-established in Montreal and are enjoying visits from their family -- and then their lives start to deteriorate. Louis is suddenly out of work, and as he faces the difficulties of finding another job -- and of living precariously -- he becomes more radical, less accepting of the status quo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9zhmM8TQEX9nmLM2M5AUOSnWLHW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les années de rêves","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
