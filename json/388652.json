The last three, still teenagers, lend a summery and easy-going tone to the film, which is magnificently framed by Eugène Green’s long-time cameraman, Raphael O’Byrne. The dialogue that settles in between the younger members and those in their thirties has a rare quality, as if the difference of language – which each has had to impose on their family or on their national entourage – had almost tacitly created a secret community. Starting with the political stakes (regional languages versus centralism), the story hikes over the mountains with these new friends brought together by the filmmaker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yjLlVojxg6dei8Bs2i0TKBhyiVC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Air","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faire la parole","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
