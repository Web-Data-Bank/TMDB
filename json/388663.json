He spent very few years living in Tel Aviv, but he loved the city dearly.

Combining special animation, a voice track by Chaim Topol, rare archival footage, long-forgotten photographs, poems by Bialik performed by Ninet and interviews with the foremost Bialik researchers and fans in Israel and around the world, this film retells the story of the little boy from the shtetl, who became King of the Jews.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avi Chai fund","origin_country":""},{"id":29725,"logo_path":"/6PJrEn8WR7RQzbwv6vGoEvxg6Dh.png","name":"HOT","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2014-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bialik - King of the Jews","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":4}
