Although the two compatriots both live in the capital, Caracas, and both love music, they have a need to go out into the rest of the country and discover their roots. As big-city dwellers, they are limited in their perspectives, though this excursion into other areas of Venezuela may prove more illuminating to them than to a foreign audience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x1u76MTYeZDQGYX1UJ3Qt98lxhc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manoa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
