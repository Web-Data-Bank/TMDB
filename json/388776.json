After leaving his high-pressured existence as a successful architect, the newly resolved dropout goes to live in a small community of cabins and summer homes in a lake-filled region north of Warsaw. His interactions with the villagers, including a drunkard and other eccentrics, provide an informative background for what happens next. The ex-architect's wife is a professional singer who has not abandoned the city or her life -- and she soon arrives to spend some time with her very changed husband.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6P39oO2vjxHOxoIuQmUwrsMAq13.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Polski","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":2552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Perspektywa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1979-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Moon","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
