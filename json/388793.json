They were even more disgruntled when they realized how the coup was being manipulated by leftist officers to instigate genuine elections and establish a constitution for the first time in Portuguese history. Though their intent was to form a radical socialist state, circumstances prevented this, and a genuine parliamentary democracy emerged. This film explores the circumstances of a right-wing businessman during those times. The man is an old-fashioned authoritarian, whose attentiveness to the needs of his mistress, wife and son is crude where it exists at all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6vyyKNX1npjI1dpzySaoo2Fs9m1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Holy Alliance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
