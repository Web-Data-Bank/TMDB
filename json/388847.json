Ion (Dan Nutu) seeks to find out why many years ago his father was falsely accused of being a communist, an accusation which led to his execution. He discovers that his father's mistress, now married to a wealthy man, made the accusation for money, as she was deathly afraid of poverty. Ion's own girlfriend seems to be similarly concerned about issues of livelihood, and abandons him for a richer suitor. Frustrated and angry, he burns down these couple's houses and takes up with some anti-communist arms smugglers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ym0JvcWTxQq1YXE12N0NtAnS2Ob.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casa de Filme 1","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1974-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Sands","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
