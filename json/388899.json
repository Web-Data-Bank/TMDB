The three partners are totally careless of the economic crisis and they waste money organizing lavish conventions for the success of their wines. But all this is doomed to an end. As a matter of fact the three partners suddenly find out that their company has 500,000 euros of debts and they only have 15 days to find the money. And it won't be easy: they'll try whatever, with an escalation of despair, comic situations, misunderstandings and absurd episodes that will lead to nothing. And when all seems to be lost, they find the solution which was right under their eyes: a glass of Bianco di Babbudoiu.","popularity":1.216,"poster_path":"/3jA6f7j8HKNW2SZMqr5KRkC8vhP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Fistful of Grapes","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":25}
