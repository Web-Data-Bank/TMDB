Fangs as sharp as a blade. Mouth of incredible size. Powerful limbs. A variety of ideas come to mind. Well, of course, we are talking about the Spinosaurus - a spiked lizard that lives on the territory of modern North Africa, a hundred million years ago. The unimaginable structure of muscles, a giant body, distinguish a reptile from other representatives of the animal world of those times. The fossil of the alleged spinosaurus was discovered during excavations. Researchers are rushing to release the news. Images of the animal will be modeled using scanography, as a result of which it will be possible to recreate the true appearance of the ancient hunter. The results of the latest research surpass even the most daring assumptions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oTsfw0ADWrsdKuDgjNjWeBrc1bv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bigger Than T.Rex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
