Four voices are heard. Two men are telling and repeating to two others that they are “welcome to the region”. Gradually, the situation becomes clearer: the filmmaker, Zhu Rikun, is on a shoot in Sichuan. His interest is in the lung diseases that plague the region’s workers, a health problem already present in his film Dust and which the Chinese State is trying to hush up. So here he is, invited to a brief interview with the local authorities, which is audio-recorded and played back in full in the film. A raw document that bares the methods of power: the insistence of the censors, their successive changes in strategy ranging from sugar-coated threats to the express demand that the images be destroyed, which only fuels the desire to bear witness even further.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gAY2IkMcidCkXP9OaSwlbUyso39.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
