Filmed in black and white, the dark filming emulates the oppression experienced by the prisoner. In the story, the writer is a prisoner who has not yet been \"broken.\" That is, he has not yet succumbed to the skillfully applied tortures and signed a written confession of his so-called crimes. He is supposed to have planned a bombing incident. He endures an escalating number of indignities, until a fellow prisoner tells him what happens at the next level of torture, in which he would be sent to a \"psychiatric\" hospital.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4pbznl3tUyZ9EJBcGEcgt9K8OCy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
