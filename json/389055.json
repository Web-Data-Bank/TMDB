The program documents some of the first observations made by the telescope, foreshadowing the scientific rewards that will be its heritage.  Filmed on three continents--and at altitudes ranging from sea level to 16,500 feet--the film features breathtaking views of Chile's remote Atacama Desert, and demonstrates the lengths to which humans will go to understand the universe they call home.  ","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Psn0ZRsLPVRiEFruSi8PNMchay.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mark Pingry Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into Deepest Space: The Birth of the ALMA Telescope","video":true,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
