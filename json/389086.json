From a Polish soldier we hear about the invasion of Poland and his experiences on the front line; we hear from an RAF pilot who scrambled to intercept a non-existent intruder, when the sirens sounded minutes after the announcement that Britain was at war.  We also hear from the pilot who, two days later, took part in the 'friendly fire' incident that claimed the first RAF casualty of the war. Others give us a child's perspective of events. And what it was like to be evacuated.  Their stories are illustrated using archive film. These are the untold stories of ordinary people, whose words convey a true sense of what it was like to be living at a time of momentous events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Witness 1939: When War Broke Out","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
