It soon becomes clear that certain things are going wrong in their class. There have been complaints of bullying. The parents are mainly concerned with defending their own children. They throw around neurotic accusations and make untenable demands. Using a camera which itself seems to participate in the discussion, scene after scene is dissected with refreshing malice and a sense for the dark side of human nature. Desperate attempts to resolve things unleash an avalanche of other problems. It takes a long time before Denise, Bella and Mina can have their say.","popularity":1.021,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73890,"logo_path":"/6RodVecoMH9nXF2ZNXexpUoujf9.png","name":"[sic] film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6A","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
