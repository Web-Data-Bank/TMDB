Made on videotape, with expressionist colouring 'injected' by electronic means, this emerges as a hypnotic transmutation of a theatrical event into poetic cinema, capturing the ambiance and frenzy of the original.  No documentary record could have done it justice.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/lTs5xMlIIDoiFRN7Q0N3HnMClrB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise Now","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
