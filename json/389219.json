A modern take on Zbigniew Rybczy≈Ñski's Tango, every actor that participates in this space is trapped in an infinite loop where their actions simultaneously bare and yet bare no consequence to another. Starting with a single actor that performs the same series of mundane actions, followed by another and yet another, we start to discover the motivation of these characters and their performance do not simply coexist but are correlated in a complex chain of events. Hilarity ensues as every absurd action cumulates in an amalgamation of intricately choreographed antics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Brief History of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
