In this programme, she searches for an answer to a puzzling question: “How did three spinsters who spent most of their lives in a remote parsonage on the edge of the moors come to write books so shocking, erotic, profoundly moving and quite wonderful?.”  Sheila embarks on a journey that starts in the Yorkshire village of Haworth and the brutal moors that inspired Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, moves on to Brussels, where Charlotte Brontë developed the writing style that made Jane Eyre an enduring masterpiece, and ends in Scarborough, the last resting place of Anne Brontë.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jY9keeoim7kop6CpAvapLnKAJFZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Brilliant Brontë Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
