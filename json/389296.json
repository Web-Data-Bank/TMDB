In THE KIDS MENU, Joe meets with experts, parents, teachers and kids, coming to the realization that childhood obesity isn't the real issue, but rather a symptom of a bigger problem. The lack of knowledge of what healthy foods are. Lack of access to healthy and affordable options. And the influence of negative role models, whether a parent, teacher or even a celebrity. All of this together seems to be a lot to overcome, but when empowered, kids often make the surprising choice of the healthier path.","popularity":0.88,"poster_path":"/iyHtV8PHwwtY5zDsak0d6CKHVhV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kids Menu","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":9}
