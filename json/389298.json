Although the maestro is frequently unfaithful, he denies the affair; Elvira insists she's right and publicly hounds Doria. Between scenes in this domestic drama that turns tragic, we watch a Scottish company rehearse and stage \"Turandot,\" Puccini's last opera. The film finds parallels between the two stories and suggests that in the opera, Puccini expresses love for his wife and guilt in Doria's fate. Three local gentlemen provide a spoken chorus as Puccini's score plays throughout.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yUtSQogEOuWyyEjMNgNiOLFGBf6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puccini","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
