Jim is also trying to make it with the woman of his dreams, Christine Callaghan (Keeley Hawes, Othello and Wives and Daughters), while simultaneously being pursued by the woman of his nightmares, fellow lecturer Margaret Peel (Helen McCrory, Anna Karenina).  One (of many) complications is that Christine is the girlfriend of Professor Welch's egotistical artist son, Bertrand. Another is that Margaret keeps attempting suicide to get Jim's attention. But despite his misadventures, Jim keeps his eyes on the prize: a leg up on the ladder to a professorship in medieval history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucky Jim","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
