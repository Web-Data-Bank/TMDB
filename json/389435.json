Scientists over the decades have examined this priceless specimen to try and determine what made this seemingly normal man change the face of science and define the word genius. This documentary will follow the path of Einstein's physical brain and all the places it traveled, while simultaneously telling the story of Einstein the man. This special dives deep into Einstein's life, his theories, and not just what we've learned about the human brain by studying his, but what we have yet to learn.","popularity":1.514,"poster_path":"/cnM1F0cXFWXRNv9BFIZIYUZFIKB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secrets of Einstein's Brain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
