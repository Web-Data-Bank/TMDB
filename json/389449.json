Shandling's \"average guy stuck in the farce called life\" persona works quite well within the framework of the tape. Casual fans, however, might prefer the Johnny Carson-baiting Shandling of the much-later cable series It's Garry Shandling's Show and The Larry Sanders Show. Like those two projects, Alone in Vegas began as a Showtime cable special--Shandling's first, in fact.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6eYb0Yg47KIpeYLb5mtIUrP3qmH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garry Shandling: Alone in Vegas","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3}
