No one knows why Massimo has vowed to stop talking. Other than speaking dialog from classical plays, Massimo refuses to say a single word. His father, a classic-literature professor believes it reflects to a disappointing love affair. His new girlfriend thinks Massimo is rebelling against his mother, a poet. A director learns of Massimo and commissions his mother to write a play about him. Though Massimo plays himself in the play, and does speak, he returns to silence when the play is finished.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b7I6Y7N1H2nPVd1T1QJUEZmf5oF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmalbatros","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":27124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pierre Grise Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":140786,"logo_path":null,"name":"Happy Valley Films","origin_country":""},{"id":78114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waka Films","origin_country":""},{"id":139666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Istituto Luce-Italnoleggio Cinematografico","origin_country":""},{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":140787,"logo_path":null,"name":"Televisione Svizzera Italiana (TSI)","origin_country":""},{"id":8540,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Script Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":21990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Office Fédéral de la Culture","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1994-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Butterfly's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
