In the story, Jozef Schrevek is a man with unusual powers which he wishes to pass on to his son before his death, which is coming soon. Unfortunately, his son is much more interested in boozing and womanizing and being a well-known habitué of nightclubs, than in taking his father seriously and receiving his powers and the responsibilities which come along with them. The tension between the two escalates when a young woman enters their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jNDCB7jX0LsTsK0qHVW93p2SZfg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Budapest Filmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1991-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paths of Death and Angels","video":false,"vote_average":6.75,"vote_count":5}
