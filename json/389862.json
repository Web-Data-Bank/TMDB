Instead of penalizing the boy for his behavior, Lena gets stuck with a court appearance and must pay a small fine, in addition to losing a boyfriend, her college career, and an apartment. Lena belongs to a film club which occasionally hands out awards, and the membership of it decides to send her into the Russian hinterlands to hand out an award to an obscure filmmaker. Throughout the film, Lena has been associated with a bizarre con man named Stepanych who, when his cons fall through, comes to her in the distant town she has gone to seeking her help in committing suicide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vWM3vitSOd9zf9IKvn8UEjwecId.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Excelsior Film","origin_country":""},{"id":21978,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1989-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Dark the Nights Are on the Black Sea","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
