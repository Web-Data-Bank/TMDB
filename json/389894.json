One tribeswoman expresses a desire to have a child, but is rebuked by being reminded that she has vowed never to have worldly ties that would distract her from the quest. When she has a child anyway, she and her lover are made to pay for this crime in a horrific way. Despite that, the child becomes a kind of holy mascot for the group, touted by the leader as a kind of savior. They are distressed when the child goes missing one day, only to appear mysteriously on the opposite side of the rapids of a river, beckoning to them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ln9JVHMYVImdqYdpDwpPa7gbYii.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23332,"logo_path":"/7DAK0C5Ftkm9cpnhjwpRhpYq6t7.png","name":"Tajikfilm","origin_country":"TJ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1988-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whirlwind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
