At this point, the comedy takes a turn when the rebellious mathematician follows a strange wheel and meets a goatherd who shelters him in his humble abode. Events change from a bit odd to totally bizarre as the mathematician continues on his journey of escape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gN35OMeJ1fsBV2e0fRhgRe1fFTc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana Film","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1986-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Are You Going?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
