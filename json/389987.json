Then it becomes a nightmare with Walker as a cruel dominatrix and the guy bound to a post.  \"Dreamgirl\", aka \"Stacey Walker, Dreamgirl\" (c. 1966) is a strange little film by producer David F. Friedman that was released as a short. But it also appears to be an excerpt or alternate take from \"A Smell of Honey, a Swallow of Brine\" (1966) with legit actor Sam Melville.
