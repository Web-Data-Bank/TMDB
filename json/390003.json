A journalist goes to a southern European country to interview a well-known terrorist who has refused to stop his activities even though the revolution he fought for ended successfully five years earlier. Questions are raised about adopting violence as a way of life without at first realizing it and about the seeming impossibility of raising the consciousness of backwater cultures. Perhaps because of the way the story has been filleted into fragments, characters like the journalist and terrorist do not have enough continuous screen time to build up their individuality, a second factor that makes it difficult to become involved in the drama.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/3ygv5YTZNQFMcTJVenGrbyTdo2S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1984-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frontier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
