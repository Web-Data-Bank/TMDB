Duncan Renaldo, actually Rumanian, starred as the Mexican \"Robin Hood of the Old West\", with Martin Garralaga as his corpulent sidekick Pancho. In the tradition of 20th Century-Fox's earlier \"Cisco\" efforts, our hero comes to the aid of an orphaned child, clears himself of a kidnapping charge, and proves that a \"solid citizen\" is in fact a criminal mastermind.","popularity":0.633,"poster_path":"/niJSWSC4IQsehOPBH2AEPQiRW8H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"BACK AGAIN!","title":"The Cisco Kid Returns","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
