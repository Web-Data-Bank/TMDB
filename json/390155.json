Everything that we later saw in the Korean, Vietnam and, most recently, the Gulf Wars - from water boarding to search-and-destroy tactics - already happened during the USA’s first major 'civilizing mission' abroad, as it was sold to the public at the time. In the decade following the Spanish-American War, more Filipinos were killed by US troops than by the Spanish during the 300 years of colonial rule. More than 1 million Filipinos died between 1899 and 1913.  This experimental documentary about the Philippine-American War of 1899 combines archival photographs and turn of the century film, digital video and 16mm footage to create memories of a forgotten history. A contemporary Filipina-American narrator weaves this complex history through historiography, experimental documentary and intercultural cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7k1LBpewvKxRRB5pPRytvgJd56C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kawayan Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories of a Forgotten War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
