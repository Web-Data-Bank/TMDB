While the short portrait documentary field is certainly overcrowded, director Mohammad Gorjestani’s film is beautifully shot and quickly paced. It’s got a certain energy that can’t be denied (much like artwork driving the film). Plus, the central character is an inspiring symbol of artistic authenticity and self-liberation. A former advertising executive, MissMe ditched her high-profile corporate day job to become a counter-voice to the objectification of women in the mainstream advertising world. Girl power, indeed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missme: The Artful Vandal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
