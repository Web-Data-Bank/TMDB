Tof**k yourself- I want some meat”), Stephen Lynch will always consider himself “a musician trapped in the body of a comedian.” His unique blend of musical based comedy has earned him fiercely loyal fans around the world who live to experience his sold-out live shows, five best-selling CDs, his RIAA-certified Gold DVD and his 2 top-rated Comedy Central Specials. You may also recognize him from his Tony-nominated role starring in The Wedding Singer on Broadway.  Hello Kalamazoo is his first special in over 10 years and was recorded at the end of his Lion tour.","popularity":1.186,"poster_path":"/fnYbZ7TfV6BK2uDdkYtFOCjxGga.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hello Kalamazoo","title":"Stephen Lynch: Hello Kalamazoo","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":5}
