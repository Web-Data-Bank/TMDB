Trace Elements, Nelson’s latest work, is another “sound video”, despite the fact the camera is more active this time. It feels as though only now Nelson has totally come to grips with her new technique. She approaches the moving image again through highlighting the act of shooting. This way she continues the ever-present indexical tradition of her filmmaking despite the fact that the video is based on the idea that the camera never quite finds its target. I believe the active, searching camera in Trace Elements indicates Nelson will continue making movies for many years to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trace Elements","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
