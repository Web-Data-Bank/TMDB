Inevitably, Bret and Margie quarrel and break up, only to be reunited by their efforts to snag \"banana king\" Gomez (Mischa Auer) for a lucrative radio contract. The old 1920s tune \"Margie\" is heard throughout the proceedings, frequently fitted out with ludicrous new lyrics (\"Bananas! We're Always Thikin' of Bananas!\" etc.) by a zany songwriting team (Eddie Quillan and Wally Vernon).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wujOeywKiLZmFIrkEEcMtJAfUTA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
