Asked \"So how many crazy people watched you?\", he responded: \"A whole crazy, psychologically disturbed nation\". Why were the Germans or to be more precise, the West Germans, a psychologically disturbed nation at that time? This is a film about cheerful and serious games, therapies for re-education and self-imposed re-education, as well as the history of the idea of permanent revolution. Those appearing include directors and producers of gameshows, psychiatrists, anthropologists, and the diversely paranoid.","popularity":0.913,"poster_path":"/zj85AirM4XdHkoxqugeQe9wcAJ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lutz Dammbeck Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overgames","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":9}
