She heard about the blessing Wilford Woodruff gave her mother, promising that she and her children would reach their destination and experience the Lord's providential hand on more than one occasion.  But Jane was only an infant when they made their harrowing journey and is beginning to doubt her mother's fantastic stories -- until she receives a miracle of her own.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":"/wUnNkqcGrTzdgt6vFTMbWIv2hTX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Remember Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Elizabeth Panting Story","title":"A 2nd Witness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
