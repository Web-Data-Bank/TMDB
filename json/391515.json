Like the Internet itself, the project is effectively endless, containing video clips, spoken sentences, news, tweets, charts, graphs, lists, and millions of individual data points. The time you can spend interacting with the project is based on the average life-expectancy where you access it. Co-creator Jonathan Harris has created many fascinating digital art projects including We Feel Fine and I Love Your Work. His work has a way of making us both celebrate and question the wonderful world of the web. In Network Effect the result is a voyeuristic and unnerving experience about our over-stimulated digital lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Network Effect","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
