Nearly 80,000 of those are held in solitary confinement. They have no human contact and every element of their environment is controlled. Meals come through a slot in the solid steel door, as does all communication with prison staff. They might be allowed to shower once a week. They might not see the outdoors for months or years on end. They spend 22-24 hours a day in their cell with little to no human contact for days or even decades. The sensory deprivation they endure causes severe psychological damage. These people are invisible to usâ€”and eventually to themselves. The UN has condemned solitary confinement. But it continues. (This is a virtual reality project featured as an installation for the first time. It is also a 2016 TFI New Media Fund grantee.)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6X9: An Immersive Experience of Solitary Confinement","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
