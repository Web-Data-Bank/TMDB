He combed through over 500 hours of race footage from the early 1950s up to 2001. Taking in the careers of such greats as Jim Clark, Ari Vatanen, Tony Pond, and Pentti Airikkala this excellent documentary tells the story of how a part-time hobby turned into a multi-million dollar competition contested by major works teams. Packed full of great action footage Evolution captures the true essence and atmosphere of one of the most popular forms of motorsport in the world today.","popularity":0.676,"poster_path":"/hB0T5V5N3jPFewcze0vUoEDZRAQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fifty Years Sideways","title":"Evolution of Rallying","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":1}
