This tragicomedy of the highest order cries out for the finest musical forces, voices and staging to be truly overwhelming and meaningful. The cast for this production includes Ildebrando D´Arcangelo and Carmela Remigio. With direction from Riccardo Frizza and one of Italy’s finest stage and set designers on hand in veteran Pier Luigi Pizzi, the course is set for a staggering night at the opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5MkFy8nQ5OPYJoJO62QOuFhTl5u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71713,"logo_path":null,"name":"C major","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2011-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":174,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Giovanni (Sferisterio Opera Festival)","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
