It is a sort of summary of Steina and Woody Vasulka's first creative period, a period of fascination with the more bizarre aspects of \"new American decadence\". Thanks to the video camera and its revolutionary implications, the creators were able to penetrate into spheres where the documentarians of more classical media were neither allowed nor interested to enter, thereby helping to expand the ideas of documentary possibilities. Steina has remarked that she learned the craft of camerawork as documentarian thanks to these celebratory, countercultural scenes of the \"sexual avant-garde\"-- Participation also features a pulsing light show projection at the Fillmore East, and a scene from Off-Broadway drag theater.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eY5rQVGqayXefdSysTkJqUsW75S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Participation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
