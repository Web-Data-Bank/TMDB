With some prodding, the tourists unwittingly reveal an unattractive and pervasive ethnocentrism to O'Rourke's cameras. The tourists thus become somewhat dehumanized by the camera, even as the tourists themselves are busy exoticizing even the most mundane aspects of Sepik River life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kmhhaA5jRRj5FmzCeQGTSGGepCn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":117632,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institute of Papua New Guinea Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PG","name":"Papua New Guinea"}],"release_date":"1988-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hiri Motu","iso_639_1":"ho","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There is nothing so strange in a strange land, as the stranger who comes to visit it.","title":"Cannibal Tours","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7}
