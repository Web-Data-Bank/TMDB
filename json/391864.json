SEED is the story of the journey this girl takes from the enchanted nature of Nara to the chaos of Tokyo, and the encounters she has along the way.  A boy offers her the gift of an apple, which she in turn gives to a homeless man, who proffers a soft piece of chiffon fabric in return. Moving like a tree that sways in the wind, the girl embodies a spirit that secretly runs through places and living things. The eleventh film commissioned by Miu Miu Women's Tales was directed by the multiple Cannes award-winning Japanese director Naomi Kawase.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xRt3VqwxFLl07z7nE0NxM5Ll3bf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80827,"logo_path":"/fCqpIP4qYAiGurZdFgyFwcsrvow.png","name":"Miu Miu","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seed","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
