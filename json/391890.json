In it, he applies many of the various techniques he has developed for his films over the years, the result being a rich collage of drawing, photographic images, and live-action film footage whose individual frames he has manipulated. This complex technique exists, according to Kucia, only as a vehicle to evoke the mood and emotion he wishes the audience to experience. This Impressionist approach to filmmaking is no doubt what inspired Marcin Gizycki to dub Kucia the \"Bresson of Polish animated film.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Across the Field","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
