Touching upon everything from worldbeat, funk, rock, hip-hop and jazz, there are no limits to his experimental approach.  Among his many talents is his ability to bring together well-matched singers and players to create a distinct style that defies easy classification. His Soundstage episode embodies his unique approach, transcending any genre boundaries and delivering an engaging performance. From the World Beat of Tabla Beat Science, to the jazzy flavors of Pharoah Sanders backed by Material, itâ€™s an exciting mix. Other surprises include a rocking Buckethead set that includes a little breakdancing and songs by Praxis. The show culminates with an all-star performance, funked up by Bootsy Collins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w6y0RU27raO96VXMfTTmFLtz26P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Laswell - World Beat Sound System: Live at Soundstage","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
