His country’s dictatorship is on its last legs and chaos reigns. His wife Sylvie leaves their country for France. She writes about the new democracy struggling to be born back home. His daughter Joyce must hide out in the deserted childhood home in the solitude and infinity of the Black Beach. Several adversaries – the militia of a hazy regime in his native land and the Paris police – wage a strange game of chess in which he is the pawn. Threats abound and he’s haunted by his past, his fears, dead friends. He has three allies: his wife, his daughter, and an old girlfriend from his fighting days.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/oaPe75oF8ML7c1u5VfVe8tF79kR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Beach","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
