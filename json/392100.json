The film's title refers to the name of a haute cuisine restaurant run by a self-satisfied conservative couple, Henri and Loretta. When the two find themselves overworked in the kitchen, they retreat to the local orphanage to find some cheap waitressing help, and the teenaged Diamantine fits the bill perfectly. The haughty couple has more plans for the girl than just waiting tables, however -- the conspicuously accommodating Henri and Loretta are actually bad-mouthing the girl behind her back to the townspeople and the restaurant's patrons. They go so far as to ask the naive Diamantine to pretend that she's pregnant, and she complies under the assumption that it's a harmless prank. When their intentions are revealed, however, the girl becomes wise to the couple's self-satisfied scheming, and sets her sights on revenge.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":157982,"logo_path":null,"name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":53824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Co-Productiefonds Binnenlandse Omroep","origin_country":""},{"id":11402,"logo_path":null,"name":"Conseil Régional de Franche-Comté","origin_country":""},{"id":46596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Euripide Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":160195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harlekijn Holland BV","origin_country":""},{"id":33149,"logo_path":null,"name":"Havas Images","origin_country":""},{"id":8541,"logo_path":"/gKy5OSpgtSZIcXX9yYeJcFgPuaD.png","name":"Katholieke Radio Omroep (KRO)","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":161578,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Voleurs d'Ombres","origin_country":""},{"id":161579,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accolade Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2000-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bellyful","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
