It is a unique spiritual adventure presented in the format of a mystic initiation ritual. The story unfolds as a symbolic morality play involving two groups of people, portrayed by the same actors, but dedicated to different goals. The sinister Draconians search for antediluvian secrets of power in the lava caves north of Mount Shasta while the spiritually minded Lothinians seek enlightenment from the Ancient Masters on the slopes of the Holy Mountain–thus the dark depths and the shining heights of human nature are explored against the awesome metaphor of Nature herself.  BEYOND LEMURIA honors and extols the mystical heritage of California’s Sacred Mountain in an artistic and evocative presentation that all of us who revere Mt. Shasta can share with pride.","popularity":0.902,"poster_path":"/uYfcVtKw7eijylGymZoui3TjNDj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Lemuria","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
