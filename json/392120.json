Dr Louis van Est is a professional when it comes to the anatomy of the human body, yet he knows nothing about the condition of the human heart. As a GP, he is not the stereotypical clean cut doctor; in fact he retreats home to his laptop where he escapes from his bland life to another world world. Ella Gouws, a straightforward, straight-speaking thirty year old, has been wounded by love one too many times and won't let anyone close enough to break her already broken heart, again apart from her online chat buddy with whom she shares her dreams, thoughts and philosophies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jfVrO4Gc0gtvEhlidTWe226kxOY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phoenix Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2015-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is not a love story.
