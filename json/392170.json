They are among the most commonly found fossils, so they must have been extremely plentiful. In this meditative and largely unstructured first feature, a young geologist is traveling by train to visit his sister in the countryside after having received a disturbing and mysterious letter from her. As he travels, he remembers his childhood fixation with rocks, nurtured by his mother, and his very strong affection for his sister.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nmCjcbq6fkf8SIjknZ3ZwndErzb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eurospace","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I've Heard the Ammonite Murmur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
