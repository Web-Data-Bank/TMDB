This film explores the process by which an apprentice bullfighter, Carmelo, became a matador, a term which is reserved only for those who are recognized as being fully qualified to serve as a central player in this ritualistic drama, la corrida, which is sometimes incorrectly described as being a \"sport.\" Various senior and retired bullfighters and their relatives recount their observations and experiences, and Carmelo re-enacts his coming-of-age as a bullfighter for the cameras. Those who are already convinced that la corrida is a celebration of the mystery of life and death may particularly appreciate this respectful documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duende","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
