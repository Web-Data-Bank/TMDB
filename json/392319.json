One woman gets involved with a man who is still symbolically, if not umbilically attached to his mother, the second woman makes half-hearted attempts to get back together with her husband. The third woman calls her husband to say \"Happy New Year\" and he interprets the gist of her message as a veiled suicide threat -- rushing her quickly into a hospital for treatment. The mishaps and misadventures of the women are a telling commentary on the assumptions that marriage brings with it, and how to gain independence in spite of oneself.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/65mILyZfaWDzpyZHhMmiBTekx7k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unhappy Hat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
