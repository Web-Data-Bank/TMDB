Hasse) fought in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), but now he is an old man, readying himself for death. His daily life is filled with memories, reveries, feelings, and small but meaningful encounters; these are the stuff the film is made up of. Some of the musings are of a hallucinatory nature, as when he meets with a tramp during imaginary walks. Others are more ordinary, as when he interacts with his son's family or enjoys looking at the pretty women in the building across the street.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Peaceful Age","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
