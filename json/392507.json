Haru Urara was a thoroughbred mare who never won a race. She first came to the public’s attention after her 88th straight loss at troubled Kochi Racetrack, then picked up more and more supporters with each defeat. With her pink Hello Kitty patches, she became a symbol of hope in Japan. And though she never did win, Haru Urara did accomplish something greater: she saved the racetrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shining Star of Losers Everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
