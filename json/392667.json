This is Rainbow Salon, a supplier of hair models and wigs to salons and schools. Among these countless \"heads,\" the shop owner's wife lies in the basement of the Rainbow Salon tonight--struggling to breathe, her windpipe cut. The shop owner rushes her to the hospital and then flees. A reporter follows this case and finds that the shop owner has fled the city with his first love. As the reporter attempts to unveil the truth, an unsolved murder from the past seems to be connected to the case--and nothing is as it first appears.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f3MKuPXvLD6Zi7oCMKPlr5XKMqH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2016-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Lies, Black Lies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
