There is no precedent for The Stooges, while those inspired by them are now legion.  The film will present the context of their emergence musically, culturally, politically, historically, and relate their adventures and misadventures while charting their inspirations and the reasons behind their initial commercial challenges, as well as their long-lasting legacy.","popularity":7.78,"poster_path":"/aHfTr5dknfXEh3jzvyopbWsBhM2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of The Stooges.","title":"Gimme Danger","video":false,"vote_average":6.801,"vote_count":108}
