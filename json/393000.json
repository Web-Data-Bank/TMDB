The sound of zourna dominates the air. Resists the time stubbornly and evolves an ancient tradition of Greek, Balkan and world music.  'Rogatsia, the Sense of Zourna' celebrates the importance of small cultures. It points out the significance and the contribution of the individual, the unique and the particular to the global civilization. It portrays an “unseen” Greece where the landscape, the color, the sound and the smell, are all out and beyond the stereotypical view of foreign audiences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75576,"logo_path":null,"name":"LookNorth Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":75577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aristotle University Thessaloniki","origin_country":""},{"id":75578,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edge Hill University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2015-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...where you can smell the color of sound","title":"Rogatsia, the Sense of Zourna","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
