To accomplish this, Dr. Dyer takes the audience through a journey into the seven faces of intention - 1: creativity, 2: kindness; 3: love, 4: beauty, 5: expansiveness, 6: abundance, and 7: receptivity. Throughout the program, Dr. Dyer illustrates his points with signature stories that move the audience to tears--as well as abundant laughter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hay House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Learning to Co-Create Your World Your Way","title":"Wayne Dyer: The Power of Intention","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
