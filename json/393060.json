Alex embraces life on the farm with his new love Jessica, but cycles between a state of heightened alert and “feeling zombified” from a cocktail of prescriptions meant to stabilize his injured mind. When Jessica becomes pregnant, the dark past Alex has tried to escape—the loss of his first family, the war he was forced to leave—closes in on him. The farm becomes another battleground. Farmer/Veteran attempts to reconcile the identity of a perfect soldier with the reality of a haunted man determined to hold onto the best chance at peace he’s ever known.","popularity":1.665,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vittles","origin_country":""},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":19886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Film Producers (IFP)","origin_country":""},{"id":75597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southern Documentary Fund","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A feature-length documentary film about the legacy of war.","title":"Farmer/Veteran","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
