It's a laconic, observational documentary similar to the director's I'll Be Home For Christmas (MFF '85), in which McKenzie plays a central part, camera in tow, as he documents the lifestyle of Graham (a youth in his 20s), his family and friends. After having spent so long with the family, McKenzie becomes part of the furniture - a situation which enables him to dig deep into the subject's lives.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":"/btAo4eNJAMXwBd3BhRR1Rz7zE3m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Standard Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1991-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Waves of the Adriatic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
