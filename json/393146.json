But director, artist, animator and all-round firework of a man Len Lye specialised in the unexpected. A simple tale of a mother cheering up her daughter with a pie from her rationing-stricken pantry (interestingly the war is never directly referred to) is skilfully crafted into a work of real artistic depth, while retaining an unpretentious charm.","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":"/tz1sxleMPuFNGRh0A3zb12f2CTh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realist Films Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":6309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministry of Information","origin_country":""},{"id":76351,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1941-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Pie Was Opened","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
