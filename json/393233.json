In the central Pacific Ocean the crew of Her Majestyâ€™s Ship Bounty mutinied against their captain, William Bligh, and cast him adrift with 18 other men in an open boat, 150 kilometres from Tonga.  In an extraordinary feat of seamanship and navigational skill, Bligh proceeded to pilot the packed longboat through the cannibal-infested Fiji islands and across to the Australian mainland, landing on Cape York after a dangerous entry through what is now Bligh Passage. After a brief stay, and fearful of the local Aboriginal people, he set sail again, arriving in Dutch Timor from where he and his men took a ship back to England.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kCatfT2FRC65ejXEbFcGTFQNSRj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voyage of Bounty's Child","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
