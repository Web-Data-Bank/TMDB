The film traces their transformational journeys from soldiers committed to armed battle to non-violent peace activists.  It is a story of the human potential unleashed when we stop participating in a story that no longer serves us, and with the power of our convictions take action to create a new possibility.","popularity":1.642,"poster_path":"/y8HSExqHOGE0E1WXurNISknvnmM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reconsider","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disturbing the Peace","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":7}
