The two girls begin their friendship as penpals, sharing the similarities and differences of life in the two refugee camps. Mona and Manar are finally able to meet face-to-face at the Lebanese-Israeli border during Israel's withdrawal from South Lebanon. But when the second intifada suddenly erupts around them shortly thereafter, both girls must face heart-breaking changes in their lives.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/A7aJufllZzvWoOLM95WC65f3TKz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arab Film Distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2001-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frontiers of Dreams and Fears","video":false,"vote_average":7.333,"vote_count":3}
