We follow the hilariously bitter Billie (Jaclyn Jonet) as she attempts to find catharsis through comfort food (and wine), sawing her belongings in half and attacking a particularly meaningful local monument. Ultimately Billie must slam into the harsh reality of heartbreak before she can understand that sometimes the purest form of love is a free hug from a stranger.","popularity":0.683,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Hugs","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
