At the age of 80, the director launched his latest production, which is also his second comedy in a long row of action and historic films. \"Poker\" is a cinema adaptation of Adrian Lustig's theatre play with the same name, and focuses on four male friends, representatives for the social canvas: a doctor without a moral conscience, an unscrupulous politician, a chief of the local mafia, and a businessman who made a fortune in America. Made by MediaPro Pictures, 'Poker' looks at immorality and intrigues in politics, hinting at the fact that contemporary Romania is a day to day jungle where strings are pulled by those in power, so everything turns into a poker round, where those who have the right aces in their sleeve can win.","popularity":0.867,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Pro Pictures","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poker","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":8}
