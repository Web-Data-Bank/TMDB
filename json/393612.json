Standing on the perimeter of Rome like a monolith in the open countryside is a municipal housing complex from the 70s: Corviale. This ravaged concrete structure, which stretches for over a kilometer, has become the embodiment of a failed utopia from an urban planner's drawing board. The film interweaves the vistas of this fascinating architectural monstrosity with the ways the inhabitants see their living space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il palazzo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
