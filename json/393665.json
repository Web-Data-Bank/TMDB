As women entered the workforce in greater numbers during WWII, their young children were cared for by others. At day nurseries, trained staff supervised childrenâ€™s meals, health and play. Toddlers are taught how to wash and dress themselves and to put their toys away tidily. The film is an intriguing portrait of the nascent mid-20th century world of work for women and their families. - NFB","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1943-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before They Are Six","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
