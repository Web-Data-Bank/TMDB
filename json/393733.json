In Colombia, a country where the harsh health system requires its users to face absurd bureaucratic obstacles to access its services, PATIENT is not only the one who has the disease, but also the one in the daily struggle ensuring that his or her loved one receives all necessary needs. Nubia is a PATIENT, a mother who, despite living with the anguish of possibly losing her daughter to an aggressive cancer, firmly gets to overcome the labyrinths established by the Health System processes upon which her daughter's life depends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":80945,"logo_path":"/r3TqgJhg0HBcKAY17j29RtDqnI4.png","name":"Señal Colombia","origin_country":"CO"},{"id":80946,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gusano Films","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2015-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patient","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
