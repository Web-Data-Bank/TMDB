A follow-up to JAGUAR, PETIT À PETIT, and COCORICO MONSIEUR POULET! – undertaken with his longtime filmmaking partners Damouré Zika, Lam Ibrahima Dia, and Tallou Mouzourane – Rouch’s feature is a surreal tale of mythic proportions, full of antic humor and poetic digressions. But beyond the laughs and reveries, MADAME L’EAU is also a poignant commentary on the ‘poisoned gifts’ brought to West Africa by development projects. As Faye Ginsburg once remarked, this is a film about what the world would look like “if Jean Rouch was the president of the World Bank.”\" - Anthology Film Archives","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madame l'eau","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
