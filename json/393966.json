The trials are physical, but above all psychological. The director followed the journey of several pilgrims for 3 years. None of their paths are the same. Step by step a new rhythm of life sets in, offering new perceptions. The repeated contact with nature, the elements and other pilgrims puts each personality in its rightful place. The alchemy of the path operates little by little. Old clothes facing the setting sun. The old man disappears to give birth to the new man.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/tIoq4ZciMRmLhQfZtIicz1yzQEA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Betel Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Compostelle, le chemin de la vie","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
