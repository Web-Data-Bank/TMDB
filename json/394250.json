Female dancers in mod clothes dance on the Eiffel Tower in comparison to the primitive dances of native Africans.

Commentary and modern jazz and pop music help to make this seem much longer than 66 minutes.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":"/dJ0WwuOj1Rcw0sM26h5u5X6GZcY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1968-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Batouk","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
