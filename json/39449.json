Ever since a megalomaniac general and his followers took over the place, life has been miserable. Then a stranger, a man-of-few-words, comes to town. A quick-drawing gunslinger, he first joins the conquerors. As time passes, however, it rapidly becomes apparent that he really sides with the townsfolk, and when the time is right, he leads them into a violent uprising.","popularity":3.262,"poster_path":"/t80oxQHlxp9NGN7a5mCP4GgVvZy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125558,"logo_path":"/7ZDyxnaGb2YzJXJQYYJU8HmjlQx.png","name":"PM Entertainment Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where the Future collides with the Past","title":"Steel Frontier","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":10}
