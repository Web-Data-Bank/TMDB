In all Doubt on Loan focuses on the dysfunctional librarians of Shawcross Library and Interactive centre, as they navigate their way through running a failing library in our increasingly hyper-modern technology based world, relationships and their pasts. Making matters worse their warped views, and precarious judgments often lead them to trouble, creating a myriad of uncomfortable situations that usually only get worse before they get better (which doesn't often happen).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17700,"logo_path":"/30KETxKJcX7cm65WymAKMYPP6C4.png","name":"NFTS","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-02-29","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doubt on Loan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
