The experiment originated with the French scientist and explorer, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, on whose work the idea of oceanic exploration is based. The film shows the preparation and training needed for the expedition and the working conditions both inside and outside Conshelf Three, a specially made steel bubble which served as home and laboratory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76006,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Columbia Broadcasting System","origin_country":""},{"id":3434,"logo_path":null,"name":"David L.
