Sitting Bull’s words, as portrayed by Adam Fortunate Eagle, dominate this story. Augmented by a narrator’s historical perspective, over six-hundred historical photographs and images, and a compelling original music score, the film brings to life the little-known human side of Sitting Bull as well as the story of a great man’s struggle to maintain his people’s way of life against an ever-expanding westward movement of white settlers. It is a powerful cinematic journey into the life and spirit of a legendary figure of whom people have often heard but don’t really know.","popularity":0.991,"poster_path":"/tDHV4pxibhBSGgeGFSG5pERqGZX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76036,"logo_path":null,"name":"LilliMar Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The great American Indian Lakota Sioux Chief, spiritual leader and warrior as never before seen in a film.","title":"Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
