It was titled \"Numax presents...\" (1980). Those images, recovered, together with the situation in which those same workers are so many years later, lead us to reflect on the last and intense decades that have been lived in Spain, to discover the fragility of youth ideals and offer a history of the political transition from dictatorship to democracy.","popularity":0.765,"poster_path":"/1q0Y3SVWQkOJ93j0MwK7Cah5spN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ovídeo TV S.A.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2004-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Veinte años no es nada","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
