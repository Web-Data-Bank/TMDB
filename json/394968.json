During a few days at a vacation home, Katha, a woman in late middle age, tries to cope with an influx of discontented, disconnected relatives. Her divorced daughter brings all sorts of people to the house, including a woman-friend accompanied by her psychotic son; the grandfather of the house is convinced he is dying and is satisfied by nothing; and some friends drop off their angry teenage son to stay with her, while they go on a long trip abroad. Her friend Emma doesn't help much with keeping a lid on things, as she is a social worker who is fascinated by the awfulness of these situations.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/gMF5FG141ItdIbx5AvoKHmhhXyi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":7445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinematograph AB","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":6181,"logo_path":"/eaQ7or8IoEmPfgmQiU2C5lVZkxS.png","name":"SF Studios","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1977-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
