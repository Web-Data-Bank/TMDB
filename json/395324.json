They don't have millions of dollars to waste on padding or special effects, but they still manage to pull off their stunt, with little or NO BUDGET! Two crazy brothers, a pro BMX rider, pro skateboarder, pro wrestler, gymnast with balls of steel, blonde bombshell model, and a NO-LEGGED amputee recreate their favorite stunt scenes step-by-step. First you watch the stunt straight from the film, and then the Hollywood Stunt Dummy re-enactment and see how similar they actually are. Props, wardrobe, camera-angles. They even imitate the acting... well, at least try!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76156,"logo_path":null,"name":"We Play Crazy Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dummies recreate Hollywood stunts.","title":"Hollywood Stunt Dummies","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
