In this utterly charming showbiz chronicle, four stellar magicians will amaze even the staunchest of skeptics. But for each of these virtuosos, true success seems illusory. Among them: Brian Gillis was Johnny Carson’s favourite close-up magician and a regular on The Tonight Show; David Minkin can levitate almost anything with his mind; and Jon Armstrong might be the best card trickster in the world—but none of them are satisfied. Each can captivate a crowd, but how long can they chase their dreams and at what cost? Following the artists on and off the stage, Magicians: Life in the Impossible captures the sacrifices, the obsessive drive, and the very real possibility of losing everything for the one true love of their lives.","popularity":3.081,"poster_path":"/boVt0fLJec3uDLDYSkjie02VkxG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magicians: Life in the Impossible","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":24}
