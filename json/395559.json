Made on 16mm, and incorporating found footage, original material, animation, and processed images (Vancouver's groundbreaking avant-garde cinema of the 1970s is a decided influence here), Fleming's film offers a visually dazzling, emotionally wrenching, oddly humorous account of two profound personal traumas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Take Care Now","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
