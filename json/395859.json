The film is as much the making of animation as it is a paper model of a computer. The cube sheet, upon which the film is based, is so constructed that a horizontal cubic rotation and a diagonal pan yields a diagonal rotation. Combinations of these primary moves result in more complex rotations throughout this awe inspiring film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cubits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
