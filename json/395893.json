Their work became synonymous with campaigns to protect Tasmania's natural heritage. They shared many things, including a bond that was more like that of father and son. Both came from Baltic Europe and migrated to Tasmania, where their passion for nature became a crusade to save an environment under threat. Both died in the wilderness, doing what they loved, and left a legacy in extraordinary images. Their philosophy was simple and remarkably effective - if people could see the beauty of Australia's wild places then they might be moved to save them.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wildness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
