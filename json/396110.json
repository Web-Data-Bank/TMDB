Its unique location, a passing railway and a fork in several roads, proximity to the front line, made it attractive to German troops. They placed a rather large garrison in the city. In the city and in its outskirts, an underground was organized. Most of which were recent graduates of the school. This is a story about two fates, two former schoolchildren - Alexei and Dmitry. The first went underground and tried in every possible way to prevent the invaders, giving his life for his homeland. The second sided with the enemy and became an executioner for his own compatriots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uRPqJKUPkde2phH22dhulxjnIve.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"72  Hour's","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
