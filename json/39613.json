In his heart and his mind, he has only one desire: To take revenge on Comodus. But in order to do so he must first become a gladiator, win glory in the arena, make himself loved by the public, and become a myth. When he arrives in the city, he meets Domitila, Cesar's cousin, and an old love of his. When Domitila sees him again, she gives free rein to her passionate feelings, but must do battle with Siria, the slave-girl who is with Maximus. The second chapter of The Private Gladiator trilogy is even more spectacular than the first. In fact, after the battlefields, Maximus must fight again in the arena at the Coliseum, against gladiators and savage beasts. This second thrilling episode of the saga is also a faithful reconstruction of the amatory arts of Roman women, whether they were Patricians with an itch to scratch, or unbridled Plebeian women given to sodomy and gangbangs.","popularity":6.564,"poster_path":"/8NpEeCWAeMbrYEj1WZcwKvjykex.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5788,"logo_path":"/yinfjn2frssMZuW2DNVH1QwJBZv.png","name":"Private","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Private Gladiator 2: In the City of Lust","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":3}
