Some were lured into sexual slavery by locals working for the Japanese Army, who promised them work in factories or hospitals; others were simply abducted and enslaved in the nearest comfort stations. Chinese scholars have estimated that close to 100,000 women were forcibly taken from their homes during the war, although lack of official documentation has made it difficult for historians to reach an agreement on the exact figure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cPVlzY8zToCLH3O4WCyGquV6owK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give Me the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
