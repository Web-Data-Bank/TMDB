Sole witness:  the movie camera. Fixed, directed at a single expanse, obedient to the orders  of wires that I manipulate: characters splitting in two through the asymmetrical  filtration of the comings and goings of self-irony.  Composed of various extracts of historical films, such as the Eisensteinian  battleship, intercut with stairways of various sorts; the unceasing use of negatives  persecuted by positives and vice versa; a cinematic-theatrical dialogue between  philosophical doubling and filmic doubling.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vampa Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1973-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hilarisdoppio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
