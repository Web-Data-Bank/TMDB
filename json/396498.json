The movie also lingers on the contamination caused by the corrupting Western society. Nice exotic and harmless 60s mondo movie with some great visuals. Urban clumsiness is also widely documented: slums with pimps, whores, poverty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malesia Magica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
