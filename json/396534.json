Jabe measures 6ft 2inches (188cm), works as a dominatrix and lives on the margins, defying society's expectations of the 'normal' 'feminine' body and sexuality. Jabe Babe also has a life threatening genetic condition called Marfan Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder which affects one in three thousand people. This hybrid documentary film, merging fiction and non-fiction forms, inhabits the heightened technicolour world of the tall woman, the outsider, to boldly provoke questions on society's desire for sexual, visual, and genetic conformity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jabe Babe: A Heightened Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
