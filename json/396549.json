In 2013, Hirschhorn built a monument for Italian philosopher and communist Antonio Gramsci in a public housing project in the Bronx. The contentious artist collaborated with neighborhood residents whose everyday life is impacted by poverty, unemployment and crime. Conflicts and misunderstandings are bound to arise as Hirschhorn’s absolute devotion to art is confronted with the resident’s lack of prospects and fatalistic outlooks. The «Gramsci Monument» becomes a summer-long experiment where diverse worlds collide: blacks and whites, the art elite and street kids, party people and poets, politicians and philosophers. A nuanced film about art, politics and passion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cSHEHoxmsNJwovVmfrnoMHFdunB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":53569,"logo_path":null,"name":"soap factory","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2015-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thomas Hirschhorn – Gramsci Monument","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
