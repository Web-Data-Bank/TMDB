The island measures slightly less than 9,000 square kilometers, but has 25,000 kilometers of paved road, one of the highest proportions in the planet. Puerto Rico is one of the countries with the largest number of vehicles per kilometer (of road) and third in the world in number of cars per 1,000 inhabitants. The film was produced with the idea to raise consciousness and create a dialogue about the ongoing situation of our dependence on cars. It also shows the dangerous circumstances of an island that is slowly being covered by scrap metal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76368,"logo_path":null,"name":"RoKA Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2007-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isla chatarra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
