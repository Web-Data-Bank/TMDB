It comprises songs performed by Morissette on the television program MTV Unplugged. Twelve tracks were included on the album, but Morissette performed several others, including \"Baba\", \"Thank U\" (both from 1998's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie) and \"Your House\" (the hidden track on 1995's Jagged Little Pill), during her Unplugged concert. These were later released as B-sides on the \"King of Pain\" single release. The first single, \"That I Would Be Good\", was moderately successful, and two other tracks, \"King of Pain\" (a cover of the song by The Police) and \"You Learn\" were released as singles outside North America.
