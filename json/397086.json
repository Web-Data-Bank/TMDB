He sits idly through lessons. Then, it's time for band, where he plays the piccolo. He daydreams through the Vienna waltz, imagining himself ice-skating, and sending the school bully into the cold water by cutting a circle through the ice around him.

The teacher says, \"Arnold, everybody's gone to recess.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f2DNKL5jZ9EgXyehSWgnFXl0zow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arnold Waltz","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
