A 14 year old girl. This is the story of Mignon \"Mossie\" Van Wyk, my older sister. Oh and her best friend Adriaan Prinsloo, who I think she should marry. But that's just me. For some weird reason Mossie falls in love with older guys - enter Leon Rossouw - obviously without a shirt.  This is a story about love, naturally, but it's more about being a teenager and how rough life can be. It's a story about monsters and running shoes.  About letting go and holding on.  About friendship.  It's a story about my sister and how she learns to fly.","popularity":0.846,"poster_path":"/oADhWMnIHpb8REHnenhUoMuhkMz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phoenix Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2016-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes, too late is the right time.","title":"Mossie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
