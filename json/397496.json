Paulo \"Miller\" is known for taking a dangerous jump into the Alva from a bridge each year during carnival, but what this film is about is, in keeping with the free-roving feature, much less the subject himself than Gomes and co.'s inability to pin him down; not only does he not do his famous jump during this year's carnival, but an ostensible technical/audio failure (as with the feature, it's very difficult to say how much of this film is \"fact,\" how much invented) during Gomes's initial on-camera meeting with Paulo \"Miller\" leads to five minutes of lip-readers attempting to decipher their conversation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mzk2FabkOtkYKV8H0VXATuaSqxl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9020,"logo_path":"/qAcfiiC2WPGrfotZPnoHkDtQ6lr.png","name":"O Som e a Fúria","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carnival: Looking for Paulo 'Miller'","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
