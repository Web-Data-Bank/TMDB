When the bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere, she and the other tourists are forced to seek shelter in a disused shed beside a sinister windmill where a devil-worshiping miller once ground the bones of locals instead of grain. As members of the group start to disappear, Jennifer learns that they all have something in common â€“ a shared secret that seems to mark them all for doom.","popularity":6.418,"poster_path":"/jlmbMnrzxkFaSa8UnHefY4tNuOp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63611,"logo_path":"/bHPC39cG5aAcuFnViWmRD59gzZ8.png","name":"ETA films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pellicola","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This isn't Hell.
