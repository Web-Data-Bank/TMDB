It infuriated me, because I had attempted to get away from his camera all my childhood. My father, filmmaker Joschy Scheidegger, documented our family obsessively. It was only when he died that I was impelled to take over not only his extensive film archive, but also his camera. «My Life as a Film» is a personal search for the surprising truths hidden behind my father’s pictures. A philosophical family story about filming and the attempt to capture life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76813,"logo_path":null,"name":"SwissDok GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":75732,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zürcher Hochschule der Künste","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How My Father Tried To Capture Happiness","title":"My Life as a Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
