Every song was directed by a different director and includes 2 bonus videos of unreleased songs. The unprecedented collection came about as the brainchild of otaku-house, the production company owned and run by childhood friends Nick Harmer, bassist for Death Cab for Cutie, and video director Aaron Stewart-Ahn. They saw the opportunity to enlist a variety of talented young artists to each make a short film set to a Death Cab song, without the constraints of the traditional music video- no arbitrary performance footage, the band themselves would not appear in the films. The ultimate goal was to create a series of small films that worked together as both individual pieces of art and as a unified whole.","popularity":2.558,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death Cab for Cutie: Directions","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
