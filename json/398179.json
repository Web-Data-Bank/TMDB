These are America's unseen. Dogtown Redemption tells the story of one river, and the humanity of its inhabitants in Dogtown, West Oakland, a lively, bustling yet invisible corner of California. We follow the lives of three recyclers: Jason Witt, the titan of recycling, Landon Goodwin, a former minister, and crack addict who struggles with his own fall from grace, and Miss Hayok Kay, the ultimate outsider, formerly a punk rocker from a prominent Korean family, now at the mercy of the elements and predators. Through them, we are introduced to the art, science, economics and politics of recycling: what it offers, how it touches the poor and why it matters to all of us.","popularity":1.376,"poster_path":"/wtRp2F9d2X8SQvzutgX6qnmaDI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"...the street's gonna pay me.\"","title":"Dogtown Redemption","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
