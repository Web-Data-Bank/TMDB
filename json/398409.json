Alongside marine biologist Holly Lohuis, he invites viewers to dive into this whole new world that will leave them in awe of the beauty and diversity of the oceans – the source of all life on our planet – and inspire an even stronger desire to protect what they have either seen for the first time or perhaps re-discovered along the journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":140649,"logo_path":null,"name":"K2 Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean-Michel Cousteau’s Secret Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
