As he lay recovering from this standard procedure, the nurse who was meant to watch over him fell asleep reading a bible. Thus neglected, Andy Warhol died and entered the land of legend. 25 years later film-maker Jim Sharman, writer Stephen Sewell and composer Basil Hogios interweave verse, song and imagery into a unique and dreamlike 40 minute exploration of this great artist's life, death and legacy. With Andy Warhol every yes contained a no and every beginning an end. Welcome to the mysterious and wonderful world of ANDY X.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4CjtTj4gV1ILpVRd9JlLtyANxPZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunday Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2012-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andy X","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
