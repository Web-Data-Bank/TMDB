The film covers his journey home from a super successful day at the office where he's all but closed the biggest deal of his life. Just a couple of mobile phone calls on the way home and it's in the bag. However, as he races back to celebrate with his wife and kids, we witness his fall from apparent certain victory to increasing infuriation - everyone's suddenly stopped taking his calls. His anger and desperation boils over when he can't get anyone on the phone....not his secretary, his investors, or his wife. All the while, the Zombie Apocalypse is happening around him; he's just too self absorbed to notice it... until he gets home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47112,"logo_path":"/uMmoG3iU693MFYHWV1n6sjIed7s.png","name":"Kickstarter","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's going to be bigger than Betamax!","title":"Zombies 1985","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
