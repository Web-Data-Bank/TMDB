Charting the heritage and historical importance of these revered temples of learning - from their Scottish beginnings during the mid-18th century right up to present day - against a series of candid interviews with British luminaries such as Stephen Fry, Irvine Welsh, Bonnie Wright, John Cooper Clarke, Robert Montgomery and William Seighart, the documentary makes a passionate plea to save Britain's libraries from the reality of today's political and economic climate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Safe House: A Decline of Ideas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
