When Paul goes back to the car for some cigarettes he's not given a chance to ponder the carcinogenic ramifications as an axe blade makes the point moot. Panic stricken, Helen runs into the woods, only to find Odie Pickett as her only savior. He takes her back to his place, where pregnant wife Emmy, thick-as-a-brick son Bo, and available-since-she-was-twelve daughter Sarah, do their best to give her a \"family\" welcome. While Helen's immediate danger is somewhat delayed, her newfound shelter begins showing some signs of danger as well.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/31ZMZCw1Z9PAFHKTpUW514rHrD6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24327,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zison Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She Found Out How They Live Below Tobacco Road!","title":"Scum of the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3}
