Although it's considered to be a visual satire on rural American Life, perhaps the story goes deeper than canvas. In this provocative horror tale by accliamed photographer, Carlos Batts, we see a different interpretation of a rural American Family on the 75th Anniversary of Wood's painting, American Gothic. Batts paints his own story and invites us into a world where the old farmer struggles with his crime of passion, the consequences and his iconic fate. A pcture may be worth a 1,000 words, but this painting's story will leave you speechless.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cult Epics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Gothic","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
