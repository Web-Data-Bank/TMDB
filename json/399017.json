Since the summer, thousands of young Russians, driven by television propaganda and a thirst for adventure, began to pour in. Among these volunteers were Oleg and Max. Oleg became a battalion commander and Max remained an ordinary soldier. While they prepare to fight, they discuss their motivations and share their own perspective on the conflict. The image becomes a unique personal testimony of one side of the war, one rarely seen in the western media.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oleg's Choice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
