He constantly fights with his brother, Vasilis, who is also a day laborer (painter), saddled with all the joint expenses of the house. Charis believes that his looks will someday attract a rich wife and thus change his life and solve all his problems. Martha, however, the wealthy daughter of the shipowner Karapezis, falls in love with and marries his brother Vasilis (after he saved her life) without regard for her father's opinion or Vasilis' lack of money.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2meoiHLE0sF9PXPJ0b81dqtgjKf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anzervos","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Brother, the Lord","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
