Nearby, people sit in a crowded restaurant. Detached from those around them, they eat, mumble and fantasize without any passion or engagement. A waitress apathetic recites the specials. Two men literally pass through each other near the toilets. These people have shelter and food, but they aren't alive. The restaurant almost becomes a security blanket, a place to hide from their crazy, mundane and trapped existence. The mad street preacher is a lone voice of conviction and delusion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beholder","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
