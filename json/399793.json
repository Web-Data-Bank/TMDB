At the 2015 Salzburg Easter Festival, Jonas Kaufmann did just that to rapturous praise. Universally hailed as a coup for Kaufmann, the plaudits were also showered on Philipp St√∂lzl for his innovative staging which includes live video projections while referencing the era of black-and-white movies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tj5fvsRjA4rHRVYQ8DNZQMtqry8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sony Classical","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2015-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jonas Kaufmann: Cavalleria Rusticana / Pagliacci","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
