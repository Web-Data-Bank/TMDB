Global YouTube sensation Miranda Sings (Colleen Ballinger) wants to help her fans become better people. Filmed at Seattle’s sold-out Moore Theatre, her debut special Selp Helf shares its title with Miranda’s New York Times Number One Bestselling advice book and features audience singalongs, instructional dancing and responding to hate mail.
