One minute he is exposing the contents of an audience member’s purse, and the next he is stripping to his underwear for an impossible trick. Wes brings the audience right into the show as he works his magic with boomerangs, blow-dart guns, and personal anecdotes. Nothing is off limits in this unpredictable hour of tricks, stunts, and stories.  After a string of successful TV appearances—Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us, America’s Got Talent, Wizard Wars, MTV’s Greatest Party Stories Ever—Wes Barker surpasses the tricks that have earned him over 30 million YouTube views and returns to The Vogue theatre in Vancouver to give his fans an entirely new full frontal view.
