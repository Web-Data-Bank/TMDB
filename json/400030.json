Mark has an added incentive for becoming involved as his ex-girlfriend Carol (Cheri Cameron Newell) sings at the club. But the gangsters are willing to use mayhem and murder in order to take over Roger's business. It appears that the petty mobsters are out to sell illegal weapons to anyone who wants them, especially L.A.'s youth, instead of using the club as a front for a prostitution ring as Roger suspects. Soon Mark and his trusty motorcycle have their work cut out for them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gRFxbAZfeaeezdrcR9AdEQ7Su45.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24946,"logo_path":null,"name":"west wind entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunset Strip","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
