He's at the top of his game -- and the top of his box. A full apple box, to be exact. At the height of his stardom, an unfortunate mishap occurs and Bronson loses his trusted box -- all that 'makes' the 5 foot 3 inch actor a larger-then-life phenom quickly disappears. In this short little comedy, we follow how a vertically challenged actor rises to the occasion when opportunity finds him in his most pivotal state, learning that the true foundation beneath his craft isn't necessarily a 2x1 foot box.","popularity":1.343,"poster_path":"/lJPZgH4NpmfNZYKfMunHjVCi79z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77603,"logo_path":null,"name":"MadJam Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short little mini story","title":"AppleBox","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
