Who would honestly want to replace any of them? Who can fail to be overwhelmed with gratitude to own this disc?  If I continue to count our blessings, I might mention the splendid Robert Lloyd drawing us to a thrilling finale as Don Fernando; and Falk Struckmann a convincingly evil Pizarro.  So it is certainly not complaining, but fulfilling a reviewer's obligation to tell all, when I admit that Jennifer Welch-Babidge is little more than adequate as Marzelline. One might wish for a purer vocal line in this role - like a Bonney or an Isokoski.","popularity":0.625,"poster_path":"/nGTd8N1bkuJJv0h24qKOvN9z8oS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A wonderful music with very good singers","title":"Beethoven Fidelio","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
