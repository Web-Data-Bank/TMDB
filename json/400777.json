He begins an affair with a dangerous teenager, unaware of the disastrous effects it will have on his life. “In the Dark, Softly”, directed by Joe Rubin, is a love story (of sorts), chronicling a young man's obsession with a local serial killer. And in the final film, “In Deep”, the police are trying to catch a murderer who preys on lonely men and then offs them with his extraordinarily large appendage. Maybe this killer is more than he seems.","popularity":0.897,"poster_path":"/87CmCMYWq6LPpdc70YLor5pqy17.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18860,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hornbill Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You know it will kill you.
