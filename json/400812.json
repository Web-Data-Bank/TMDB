He earns his living by breeding a few animals, while passionately looking for a mineral reserve on the mountains, but his pursuit is seen useless by his family. Devastated by vain efforts, his hope is renewed with a competition. Mehmet will attend the bull fight held in Artvin, but he returns from Artvin completely lost, once again. This simple story pictures the naive portrait of a touching life, a life struggle in hardship and the relationship between nature, animals and human beings.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":"/nR4ZvUkVTS8jqvPexeu2LXDsIGZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75209,"logo_path":null,"name":"TRT","origin_country":"TR"},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":77750,"logo_path":null,"name":"KARAFILM","origin_country":""},{"id":85580,"logo_path":"/uzlgHjP3cdXBVngkNVSojUDpzTG.png","name":"Turkish Radio \u0026 Television","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2016-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cold of Kalandar","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":20}
