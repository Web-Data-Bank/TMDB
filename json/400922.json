Yet, while these prayers are part of the Biblical journey, the fact that they dominate our conversations with God can indict a me-centered faith that is distant from the New Testament adventure we are called to in Christ.  ReMIXED prayers embrace these four concepts, while moving towards a healthier, God-centered prayer language that saturates our thoughts and words with the phrases, \"Let Me Bless You,\"\"Live Through Me,\" and \"No Matter What, Use Me.\"  A subtle shift based on radical truth.  Potent prayers for a full life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bless Me.
