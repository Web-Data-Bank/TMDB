When a massive refugee camp was hastily constructed near the Ras Jdir border checkpoint in Tunisia, a trio of filmmakers carried their cameras in and began filming with no agenda. This on-the-fly chronicle of the camp's installation, operation, and dismantling captures a postmodern Babel complete with a multinational population of displaced folk, a regime of humanitarian aid workers, and international media that broadcasts its “image” to the world. Visually stunning and refreshingly undogmatic, Babylon reveals a rarely seen aspect of the Arab Spring.","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":"/hwGzA26EI6Qrubq8awMjN85jYUV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"2012-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babylon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
