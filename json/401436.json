Other pieces commissioned by Pinschewer (e.g. a commercial for ink) are considered lost. \"Die Barcarole\" is an unusual take on the \"Romeo and Juliet\" theme, with the suitors arriving in Venetian gondolas (a barcarole is a musical piece whose measure is designed to resemble the swaying of a gondola).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b4mmnRY7vwJFKWsAt9rZtqPvaVw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werbefilm GmbH Julius Pinschewer","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1924-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Barcarole","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
