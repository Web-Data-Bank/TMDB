He was first a farmer, then a factory worker, then the head of a small family affair where his daughters became his workers. The business grew into an large factory that would be eventually taken over by the only son. The five stories show us the family and professional context of the first half of the 20th century. They are also five different versions of the serene death of a man who felt he had done his duty. The film illustrates the ideas of Max Weber, known for their importance in understanding the Western civilization that emerged from the Reformation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eVqlmCBpLtBTfzSYWBYtsbFKtf5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Educational Resources","origin_country":""},{"id":147929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aquarius Film Production","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1978-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of the Grandfather or: The Sleep of the Just","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
