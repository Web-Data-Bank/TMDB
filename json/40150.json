Prior to her Sexie tour in 2003 and under extreme pressure to write, she delved into her own life for inspiration. So began an accidental voyage into her past that paralleled her world tour and culminated in a moment of revelation about the source of her relentless drive. Film contains exclusive never-before-seen footage including the famous 'wolves' material, Izzard's first student sketches and unicycle-riding as a street performer in Covent Garden. Hilarious and moving by turns, an inspiring tale of how tragedy can be turned to laughter.","popularity":2.276,"poster_path":"/9YZDTjYrfR6qwxWRBqgvdBhffPk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Funny and heartfelt","title":"Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":18}
