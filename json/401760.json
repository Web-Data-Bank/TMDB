Then there's a slow tune and the only young male guest at the party (Pjotr Stanislas) asks her to dance. During the dance they sneak into an alcove and have sex, hidden (but not very well) by some flimsy strands forming a curtain. Her mother discovers them in flagrante and Iris is thrown out of her home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eahQ3h3v52ynOVyFfT1eojtF9tr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phoebus Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trois lycéennes à Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
