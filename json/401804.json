Here where beauty seems to be on first-name terms with fear and danger,in a place where the immensity of nature can never be dominated, the setting hesitates, along the expanses, between sparkling colours and the black and white of the snow and the water. The day-to-day images intermingle with a story of mythological aspect; that of the timeless quest for the Lost City of the Caesars, a city of gold built 500 years ago by the conquerors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/miwkZZbiEvii408xj6wFR77GAAH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78021,"logo_path":null,"name":"LA FABRICA NOCTURNA PRODUCTIONS","origin_country":""},{"id":78022,"logo_path":"/s35QPisEs34diExMuIVHZWZfbHP.png","name":"Juntos Films","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2016-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Landscape; Nature; Tribes;","title":"The Lost City","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
