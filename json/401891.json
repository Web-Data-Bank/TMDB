Joyce DiDonato is Elena, the title heroine, who is being pursued by not one, but two tenors—setting off sensational vocal fireworks. Juan Diego Flórez is King James V of Scotland, disguised as the humble Uberto, and John Osborn sings his political enemy, and rival in love, Rodrigo Di Dhu. Complicating matters is the fact that Elena herself loves Malcolm, a trouser role sung by mezzo-soprano Daniela Barcellona, and that she is the daughter of Duglas (Oren Gradus), another of the king’s political adversaries. Paul Curran’s atmospheric production is conducted by Michele Mariotti.","popularity":0.7,"poster_path":"/tuZRmc6HT2xPgzvkKhR7Ub0QsOZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78036,"logo_path":null,"name":"Erato","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rossini's Scottish Masterpiece Masterfully Done","title":"Rossini: La Donna del Lago","video":true,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":3}
