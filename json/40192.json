Similarities arise only when they try to have a relationship with a woman, because both fail equally. While Claude is simply too shy to even start a relationship, let alone meet a woman, Serge is too jumpy to have a relationship. Together they go in search of the great love in all sorts of curious situations, from the self-help group on speed dating to wedding celebrations of strangers - in the hunt for the right woman, they are no way too far.","popularity":3.689,"poster_path":"/gieCXEDWVb7DBfI3pXSmTzndisN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23089,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yumé","origin_country":""},{"id":7038,"logo_path":"/9YDo78sKAy6xxqBwVBT2Vi9FSZl.png","name":"Quad Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":694,"logo_path":"/5LEHONGkZBIoWvp1ygHOF8iyi1M.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Be Friends","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":78}
