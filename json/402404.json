We follow a multi-award winning two person team of Foley Artists and watch as they work together to bring to life a film about one morning in the life of a fishing village on the English coast. With their perfectly timed and precisely judged sound effects they transform the film as they interpret every sound detail, using props from their vast props store. This film shines a light on a little know film art form and is a testament to magic and wonder of Cinema itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qUHWrBYJQmmhyWTOfxCAz5szUdy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76682,"logo_path":"/vKZmuezGsDTv411bYIQMzWTpxFf.png","name":"Third Man Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":19404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pinewood Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret World of Foley","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
