In their own words - originally recorded in shorthand - they discuss photography, colour theory, Moliere, the scientific method, the crazy ideas of balloonists, and - of course - how to live for 100 years. These two legends of the 19th century have a lively and interesting conversation. One was born before the French revolution; the other was destined to see the marvels of the aeroplane and the movies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The First Interview","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
