They are occasions for men to adorn their bodies with paint and feathers, to display their strength in dance and ritualized aggression; for trading partnerships to be established or affirmed; and for the creation or testing of alliances. In the feast filmed in 1968, the Patanowa-teri had invited the Mahekodo-teri to their village. The two groups had been allies until a few years before this event, when they had fought over the abduction of a woman. They now hoped to renew their broken alliance, which they did successfully. Soon after the filmed feast, the two villages together raided a common enemy. A detailed discussion of this feast, and of the significance of feasting among the Yanomamo, is found in chapter 4 of Chagnon's Yanomamo: The Fierce People. The film's graphic representation of reciprocity and exchange may enrich (and be enriched by) a reading of Marcel Mauss' The Gift.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1DdZOkfn62UrmRVUBWewSAoFFOk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Feast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
