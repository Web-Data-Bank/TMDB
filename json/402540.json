Filming in Burkina Faso, Mrozowski responded with this comedy about a dictator kidnapped from the present-day and taken back through the mists of time. There he meets the mother of humanity, Lucy, who teaches him the basics of sexual equality. By the time he returns to the present, he's also received an education in 16th-century slave-trading and European influences on Africa.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/56b7YtvqgKJt5WKIQS4eDodrtRE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Direction de la Cinematographie Nationale","origin_country":"BF"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"release_date":"1998-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucy's Revenge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
