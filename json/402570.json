One of these was Stefano who, fourteen years later, goes on a journey looking for the emotional traces left by Alberto’s life and work. He visits Rome – Mostar, where together they had run theater workshops for children and youths traumatized by war – and Canada, where Alberto spent the last years of his life studying and teaching.
