On the one hand is Babarimisa, a young man from Benin who suffers from a relentless disease for which seems to have no remedy. Desperate to save his mother, Morenike, a Yoruba priestess goes to invoke the power of the Orishas gods. Meanwhile in Argentina, Shantas is a young offender living in a marginal area tainted by the practices of Umbanda, a cult derived from African religions. None of us can even imagine the surprises that come in the destination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orillas","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
