Although the ringmaster thinks he is too young to perform, Half-Pint cannot resist the applause of the crowd, and is continually turning up in the center-ring in impromptu acts which are not part of the circus-manager's plan. He joins the band making music with his trunk; performs as a unicycle artist, and generally disrupts the execution of the show.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stage Struck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
