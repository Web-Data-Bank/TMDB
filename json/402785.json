A team of uniformed players, led by the artist Ashley Bickerton, performs the mechanics of a game servicing an off-camera betting entity, the ‘House’. Although the game keeps changing and players are swapped out, one thing remains the same, the ‘House’ is hidden and controls the bets, the ‘chance’ of winning is nil.  The game, in fact, is not between the players, but rather between the ‘House’, and the ‘Bettor’.” — E.B. 1983","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/cyGKlQT6gShDzwinDE4F3MoOuKb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You the Better","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
