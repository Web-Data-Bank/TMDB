Either by choice or coincidence, he comes into contact with people who are \"different\": An Arab immigrant, who comes to Greece, a land of \"infidels\", determined to conquer it by any means; A Greek-French cello player, who is burdened by the agony of her alcoholic mother; A young Albanian pianist, who carries the curse of his own personal genius and divinity; A Greek immigrant, who was repatriated but now has nowhere to call home; A bank director, who believes everything can be bought, even love; A patrolman, who creates his own version of socio-political reality. Petros' contact with these people is in fact a traumatic experience. For each encounter he has to pay a price. Sometimes the price is material, while other times it's emotional. At times it is both. Will the experience gained make up for the loss?","popularity":0.865,"poster_path":"/gDRNdqg7mceINUHZtcR1c9TY8LT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boo Productions","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/x5m947rMvwJbNpoGil5W76dIJjB.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2014-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7 Kinds of Wrath","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":5}
