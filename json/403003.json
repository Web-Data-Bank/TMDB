After being told that the best therapy was to ride a bike, Jason entered The Race Across America (RAAM) - a 3000-mile, coast to coast cycling race. The winner will finish in less than 8 days. Sleep? Certainly not for the first 48 hours. After that, rest comes in the form of receiving IV drips and counting REM cycles. \"The Hammer\" literally puts you in the passenger's seat of RAAM as you follow an unknown rookie racer battle for the lead, get run over by a car, and feud with an unprepared crew in a fight to the finish line. In this raw, unabashed documentary, you will witness the determination of a true champion and the love that grows among near strangers through challenge and conflict. The Race Across America has no favorites; rather a taste to swallow half of the field. Each and every racer is tested. Some will pass, some will fail, but only one will Hammer.","popularity":1.255,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78349,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hornsby Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's a Race Against Yourself","title":"The Hammer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
