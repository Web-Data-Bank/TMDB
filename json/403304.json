Inspired by the \"punk\" incarnation of the Marvel superhero Storm of the X-Men. Influenced by the more dystopian stories of the X-Men franchise as well as the seminal comic LifeDeath by Chris Claremont and Barry Windsor-Smith, this original story takes a broken mutant hero \"Rain\" from the lowest depths of despair into the darker recesses of her own shattered memory. If she is to survive, she must discover a new identity and somehow rediscover her lost power.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78434,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZaneFilms","origin_country":""},{"id":78435,"logo_path":null,"name":"ThunderGoddess Creations","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
