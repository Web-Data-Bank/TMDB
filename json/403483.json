They both wear a heavy hooded costume and there is virtually no fan interaction whatsoever for the entirety of the set. The focus during a Gaia set is always on the music, and that's the way it should be. If you like hard pounding trance without the gimmicks, then watching Gaia perform is a no brainer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Armin van Buuren and Benno De Goeij make up the mysterious duo who played a fantastic one hour trance set.","title":"Armin van Buuren presents Gaia live at EDC Las Vegas","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
