Featuring everything from Status Quo-style boogie-rockers to technofied drill & bass meltdowns. Added to this they make rock & roll history by releasing an album and DVD simultaneously. The DVD holds twelve specially commissioned film shorts rendered in dizzying surround sound. This is an immaculately conceived pop masterpiece.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9cVoz9AoWhDZKO6tOUKO8RpfspN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Furry Animals - Rings Around The World","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
