He has just been released from jail, where he had spent eight years, and finds out that his boss wants to get rid of him. Tanaka is not an archetypal yakuza; he travels by public transport. But he does have two mistresses: Ayumi, who runs a nightclub, and Yoshie, a brothel-keeper. When Tanaka's boss ends up in hospital, second man Kurauchi exerts increasing pressure on Tanaka. Tanaka deliberately has himself wounded by a fighter to dodge several of Kurauchi's demands.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/yRPprzT83DxONZQHGyj1mSAV0jX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hero Films","origin_country":""},{"id":9222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Excellent Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like a Rolling Stone","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
