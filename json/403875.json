Showcasing the daring and visionary efforts of the 1963 American Mount Everest Expedition, the film examines the sheer commitment, step-by-step struggle and lasting impact of America's first ascent of Mount Everest and the pioneering first ascent of West Ridge by Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld. Five decades later, High and Hallowed returns to Everest to find out if the essence of risk, adventure and the unknown that drew the first Americans to the summit still exists on Everest today.","popularity":0.682,"poster_path":"/yN7rGaNYrynWr9mGnxrR6gvNFxG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78574,"logo_path":null,"name":"MountainWorld Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":78575,"logo_path":null,"name":"Climb.Journey.Live","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High and Hallowed: Everest 1963","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
