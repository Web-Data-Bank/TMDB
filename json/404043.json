[has] been hailed as [a] classic of the new wave. [The tape] juxtaposes fragments from a soap opera with sequences of ice skating races. The graceful movements of the skaters punctuate repeated excerpts from a dreadfully intense discussion between a doctor and his patient: ‘He doesn't do anything, doesn't say anything.... It's just the way he looks at me.... That sound crazy?’ The narrative builds up slowly as a few more words of the deadly dialogue are released. Extended in this way, the pathos is bare, the narrative content becomes meaningless and the result is particularly moving.\" --Katherine Elwes, Performance (July/August 1981)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hNYMpZUySHVtkpJ46Z1JYx2UcbM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pop Pop Video","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
