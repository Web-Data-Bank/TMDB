There are no records of the cameraman’s name – which is a pity since today the most attractive aspect of this film are views of old St. Petersburg. The capital of Russia was by no means the capital of Russian filmmaking: until the mid-1920s Moscow was miles ahead both in experimental and commercial cinema. With only a dozen surviving films from St. Petersburg this one is an important rediscovery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silken Web","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
