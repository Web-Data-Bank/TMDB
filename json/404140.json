Cameroon Race of Hope, a marathon-length sprint 10,000 feet up a live volcano, and back down again. To conquer the mountain, racers must overcome some of the cruelest conditions in sport: temperatures fluctuate 50 degrees, altitude sickness claims the weak, and loose volcanic stones can cause serious injury, and even death, as runners fly back down the mountain. Volcanic Sprint takes you deep inside the lives of athletes like Sarah Etonge, a five-time champion and mother of seven known as the Queen of the Mountain. Just days before the race, Sarah is haunted by a nagging knee injury and the strain of a hospitalized child. Sarah needs the money she earns from racing to support her children and the Race of Hope is the biggest purse in Cameroon. For these competitors, Mt. Cameroon isn't just a race. It's their best shot at achieving fame and fortune in a country short on both.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vPPoawrPvHg1ZQPOP187ZUOTsh9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volcanic Sprint","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
