Queen's formative years have never been explored in such detail. With a wealth of unseen interviews, recently unearthed rushes of Queen's first ever video and outtakes from the recording sessions of Bohemian Rhapsody itself, this is the unique story of early Queen, told by the band themselves.  This documentary completes the final part of the trilogy alongside Days of Our Lives and Freddie Mercury: The Great Pretender.  It's simple. It's real. It's raw. It's what happened.","popularity":1.074,"poster_path":"/nHzzy9JAv8Rm1nqNiSyAfctrooT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Rags to Rhapsody","title":"Queen: From Rags to Rhapsody","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":4}
