A mindset that gets worse when she suffers a traumatic head injury in an accident. Awakening in hospital, itâ€™s discovered Helen has a tumour growth in her brain causing her to experience dark visions, disembodied voices and the omnipresence of a strange young woman. Soon, lost in a walking nightmare, in which nothing is what it seems, and her vicious actions barely remembered, it becomes crystal clear that whatever is inside her cracked psyche will stop at nothing to get out.","popularity":7.665,"poster_path":"/ioNGkm4JOzk7FuQ7CojIwTsKzxu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9315,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Fawn Films","origin_country":""},{"id":5743,"logo_path":"/y8JaCRhsEz4ipl7MWE0ErxWVPYN.png","name":"Breakthrough Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let Her Out","video":false,"vote_average":4.896,"vote_count":72}
