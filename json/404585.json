An opportunistic entrepreneur develops a bond with a street kid trying to help him get to his business meeting in Makati, after losing his cellphone to a snatcher. A teacher from the province haggles with a former OFW, turned taxi driver, whether the country should follow world standards in basic education requirements. And a snatcher trying to reform himself with the help of a nurse by trying to return what he stole. Three stories all asking the same thing: what matters most, the collective or the individual gain?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Megavision Integrated Resources","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2016-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There is once a time where EDSA was not deadly.","title":"EDSA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
