RINGGO is a 16-year old boy who works as a dog-shooter (the one who assists in mating the dogs with breed -- he will see to it that the private parts of the stud and bitch will be locked during the mating and no sperm will be put to waste in the process).  Ringgo works for BONG, a 40-year old lesbian who is a breeder of dogs. One of Bong’s dogs is I’nca, who is a troubled Doberman. Things will get complicated when Ringgo, I’nca and Bong developed a relationship as if they were really mother and child, and get entangled in each other’s personal issues and becomes each other’s protector and defender.  The one that ties the three of them is that invisible umbilical cord... the cord of love and sacrifice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78796,"logo_path":null,"name":"Happy Karga Films","origin_country":""},{"id":78797,"logo_path":null,"name":"Olivia Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2016-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ringgo: The Dog Shooter","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
