With a burnt out caravan in tow filled with sooty household goods they make their move to a new council house.  Whilst Morran sees the opportunity for a fresh start, Tobias has lots of creative ideas about improving the house. But there is something about their new home that feels familiar, and through a series of fortuitous events the lopsided duo are once and for all forced to deal with the past.","popularity":0.848,"poster_path":"/h6oHcu7Xa3KeVO2mMXgnMjFq623.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4510,"logo_path":"/j9dMjGc4GHwSL0fx1iEtxz05qrV.png","name":"Jarowskij","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":33821,"logo_path":"/fygjYD07KphyW2zrcpFxk1J2SzE.png","name":"Film Capital Stockholm","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":327,"logo_path":"/vodjjKlAbwGeERPjrAhxZMBGPUc.png","name":"Nordisk Film Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":139100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plats 13 AB","origin_country":""},{"id":139101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suburbia Entertainment AB","origin_country":""},{"id":139102,"logo_path":null,"name":"RG Production AB","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morran & Tobias: Godsend","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":14}
