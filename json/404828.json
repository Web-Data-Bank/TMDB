Curiosity, Adventure & Love is a the story of a woman raised by fate to go boldly where few young women of her time and upbringing would go, into the arms of chance and life. A young American woman leaves her country and all security behind, to begin an adventure in the Philippines that would witness the birth of a nation, a cruel war and Occupation and reconstruction. Jessie is a striking personality, somewhere between Scarlett O’Hara and Amelia Earhart, who knew no boundaries and flew far ahead of her times, without regard to sex or society. Her story of a century well-lived is both rich and one that should restore our faith in our own humanity.","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/eSwgorgbwEIjY5ahIYn3lI2EHNE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78863,"logo_path":"/aKKrwUOdnQinEL8alryY9oijAta.png","name":"Tamed Rose Productions","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2016-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Home is When You Find a Moment You Don't Want to Leave","title":"Curiosity, Adventure and Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
