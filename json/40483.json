He selects Linus as his pit crew and goes to a store to select a bike, and due to insufficient funds, he must settle for a tiny, run-down putt-putt. The majority of Charlie's opponents are eliminated in the race, and Charlie, wearing a makeshift helmet carved from a pumpkin, finds himself in close competition with his friend, tomboy Peppermint Patty, and the Masked Marvel (a.k.a. Snoopy, Charlie's dog).","popularity":1.561,"poster_path":"/wSi3Xh3daiKU0jYPrdansdoOEZF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":19}
