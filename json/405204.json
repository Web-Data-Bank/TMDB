He finds peace-time Helsinki rampant with persecution of the homosexual and men around him even being pressured to marry women and have children. Touko finds refuge in his liberating art, specialising in homoerotic drawings of muscular men, free of inhibitions. His work – made famous by his signature ‘Tom of Finland’ – became the emblem of a generation of men and fanned the flames of a gay revolution.","popularity":8.356,"poster_path":"/9I1qNliGbbfKoZleqSHB9wV8kku.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6159,"logo_path":"/pbWyMDcAM6s228tiUxjl3v1OAxr.png","name":"Helsinki Filmi","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":7048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fridthjof Film","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":84232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neutrinos Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":84233,"logo_path":"/h9uR2PcH9yyYsVt3iXD6YP4zj52.png","name":"Anagram","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-01-27","revenue":1792414,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They called it filth.
