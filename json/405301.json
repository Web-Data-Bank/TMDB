This is the same question Velvet Goldmine, a great film by Todd Haynes, once tried to answer. Progressing like a detective story, The Sacred Triangle investigates the influence Lou Reed and Iggy Pop had to David Bowieâ€™s (then on the verge of a breakthrough) music and stage persona. The section on the Velvet Underground alone is enough of a reason to watch this movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/igjnxeqYsMOcuMRJsQl60VSTjOY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sexy Intellectual","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sacred Triangle: Bowie, Iggy & Lou 1971-1973","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9}
