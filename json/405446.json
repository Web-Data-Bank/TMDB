Exe, 25 years old, has just lost his job and is not looking for another one. His neighbors and friends seem as odd to him as they always do. Online, he meets Alf, a boy from Mozambique who is also bored with his job and who is about to follow Archie, another boy who has run away into the jungle. Through the dense vegetation of the forest, Archie tracks ants back to their nest. One of them wanders off course and comes across Canh, a Filipino, sitting on top of a giant heap of earth and who is about to go back to his strange, beautiful home town, where he too has a miserable job.","popularity":0.986,"poster_path":"/A0TbQiNWuaxUmnp1BaM3URJbFb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruda Cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":86170,"logo_path":"/us76ENKlfJTShgiyvKerXSE5kFD.png","name":"Un Puma","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":30666,"logo_path":"/g8LmDZVFWDRJW72sj0nAj1gh8ac.png","name":"RT Features","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":16464,"logo_path":"/iH0ZuDfP4IcZidBx6F8gY17DQ5u.png","name":"Bando à Parte","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Human Surge","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9}
