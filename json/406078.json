With power and nuance, Ellerson also confronts the thorny question of cultural authenticity by revisiting the legendary 1991 FESPACO (Pan-African Festival of Cinema and Television of Ouagadougou), in which diasporian women were asked to leave a meeting intended for African woman only. This film is both a valuable anthology and a fitting homage to the pioneers and new talents of African cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aJbq0HDX2h3QClHCoTgdRqdEqOy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sisters of the Screen - African Women in the Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
