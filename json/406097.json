This breathtaking journey will take viewers across the world’s most iconic landscapes to the heart of the greatest animal spectacles on Earth: snow geese dash through Monument Valley and New York City, vultures ascend miles above the earth then dive down to huge wildebeest herds below, scarlet macaws race at breakneck speed through the rainforest. Using unique, state-of-the-art 3D cameras in barely accessible and highly dangerous places, the audience has never before been so close to the drama and beauty of nature until now.","popularity":1.399,"poster_path":"/5ebdu47fqyE8BQU5N6dKgZTHu7x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3325,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Downer Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wings 3D","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
