It’s a tale of two great entertainment palaces—one that barely survived and the other that came crashing down while still in its prime. The Miller could still be entertaining people to this day in a grand atmosphere unlike any other. But instead, a parking garage sits in that spot–a monument to history lost and a lesson for future generations to heed.  Program includes additional segments on Wichita theater history not included in the documentary itself, and a question and answer session with some of the people interviewed in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79244,"logo_path":null,"name":"KPTS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A new KPTS documentary shows you never-before-broadcast film of the last night at the Miller, This is an epic real-life drama of the rise and fall of Wichita's grand theaters","title":"Lost Theaters of Wichita","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
