They include several of Freud's friends and daughters, and the film becomes a depiction not only of his art, but also his private persona. Lucian Freud does not appear, with the exception of a brief shot at the end of the film.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/vm18zRY5VuPV0ZZ5eMoIYiRBLSN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucian Freud: Portraits","video":true,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
