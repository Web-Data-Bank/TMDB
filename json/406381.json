Secondly,the making of this film will always remain a miracle of sorts for René Féret as no big production house was willing to finance such a brave,absolutely uncommon film in France.So this film was finally made due to René Féret's personal intervention and highly individual efforts. Its visual style was applauded by a great French filmmaker named Bertrand Tavernier who has long been one of René Féret's admirers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rue du retrait","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
