Over a few summer days, Paul evades the responsibilities of everyday life and falls in love with his brother’s girlfriend, disrupting the lives of everyone in his circle. With Köhler’s penchant for deadpan humor and subtle performances, Bungalow becomes a quiet mockery of militarism, familial estrangement, and youthful ennui.","popularity":2.673,"poster_path":"/dbHQehNiUqkeNJchoriC9L0OU1a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Stockhaus Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bungalow","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":16}
