He follows and she enters the office of a spiritualist. Producing a tip, he is initiated into the mysteries of table rocking and other occult practices and becomes interested. In the séance he is impressed with the idea that he is out to mystify his friends, and the soothsayer sells him a book, which explains all about it. Repairing to the club he cons the book and engages in experiments. The results are magical and he hastens to announce the fact to his friends. They are skeptical and treat his efforts lightly. They make all manner of sport of his demonstrations and Billy waxes wroth. He is rudely disturbed and casts about for a method of revenge. Adjoining the room is the electrical apparatus and Billy enlists the services of the electrician by means of a generous bribe. A wire is strung to the table and the plans carefully made to humiliate the unbelievers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1t2iZ9XjZdZc8dFSeuZHAOp3jkD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy's Séance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
