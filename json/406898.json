Much seem missing in the story of poor Ru Yee who applies to be the nurse maid of the Emperor’s son. She gets help to gain access by Wei (Tan Lap-Man) and soon they are both heavily involved inside the palace. She as the nurse maid and he as a eunuch in training. Wei also finds time to murder Ru Yee’s sick husband and child… a fact barely mentioned after it’s happened.","popularity":11.95,"poster_path":"/q0z4npfVI7Xh6jDPbHYJ6RUeFpf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87873,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Productions Ltd.","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1992-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Demon Wet Nurse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
