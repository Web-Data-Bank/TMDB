Central weight is given to the chimp's inscrutable gaze, indicating psycho-emotional territories informed by peculiar details that haunt the original. The resulting film is a slighlty hypnotic and open-ended parable about coming of age in a shifty world of slipping terms. LAST LOST is a silent film in spirit, trying to speak without words, like some dreams. (...) The primate of Heller's confabulation brings both peace and a sword. The reviving spirits that he releases are not easily compatible with the order of things, and such newfound awareness doesn't necessarily provide the keys to the kingdom but rather a profound uneasiness with the staple amusements and short circuitry of this provisional world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
