The steelpan can take the claim of being the only acoustic instrument invented in the 20th century. However, this sound not only moves people today, but it paralleled the islandâ€™s history of colonization and the demand for independence.  The first section of this two-part film highlights the precursors of the steelpan and the creation of the instrument until it gained international recognition in Britain in 1951. Interviews from steelpan legends, such as Ellie Mannette, Sterling Betancourt, Cliff Alexis and Ray Holman, are included.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xplore the World","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TT","name":"Trinidad and Tobago"}],"release_date":"2015-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"First section of a 2-part documentary highlighting the history of the steelpan and its global influence.","title":"Panomundo Part 1: The Evolution of the Steelpan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
