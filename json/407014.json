Yi Wen's script is full of lively and humorous details, his direction affectionate, while the young stars are charming. The film also paints a picture of a bourgeois lifestyle that was yet to occur in the ex-colony. It has also been aptly compared to the genre of hollywood \"bedroom\" comedy made famous by Rock Hudson and Doris Day in the 1950s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lfymjhxfSQV7AX2eMTgk7tCkRM6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Dream Car","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
