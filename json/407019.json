The story proper is carried by Robert Wilcox and Nan Grey, cast as a pair of mismatched lovers who share a common interest in horse racing. Hero and heroine get mixed up in a shady get-rich-quick scheme, which threatens to turns disastrous but which ends up solving everyone's problems.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mWhsaqfFFc7cwye2aDUO1fypHvX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reckless Living","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
