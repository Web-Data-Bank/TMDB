The film begins in a sacral space, where Randi, a figure that references Ayn Rand, transforms a parapsychological medium into two digital clouds and sends them on a journey through a megalopolis in full growth. There they materialize as two bodies, which go by the names of Mr. Freedom and Ms. Independence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z5Y7RqzhRCgNAor80QOua7R5nCZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79458,"logo_path":null,"name":"Limboland Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom & Independence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
