Hilarious presents a stand up monologue of a female comedian performing live in front of a studio audience. If humor is a mechanism set to cope in particular ways with disturbing, sometimes forbidden topics, this performance not only offsets these structures through their failure, but also offers a different manifestation of these topics, left exposed without the guise of laughter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hilarious","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
