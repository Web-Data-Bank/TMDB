Full of candid interviews from celebrated figures to everyday people, health care professionals, sex therapists, zoologists, anthropologists, and religious figures, this feature length doc answers age-old questions like: What is masturbation? Will it make me go blind? Is it \"normal\"? Is it wrong? And why are we so afraid to be caught in the act? In a world where confusion about sexuality remains at the root of so many societal problems - rape, sexual abuse, and the threat of sexually transmitted diseases - \"Sticky\" will help shatter misconceptions and myths surrounding this intimate aspect of human sexuality.","popularity":2.99,"poster_path":"/3pyu67Zpu8PtObjpal4Hq2mPpGV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smart Media","origin_country":""},{"id":81004,"logo_path":null,"name":"BlindFolk Entertainment,","origin_country":""},{"id":81001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Incite Visual Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sticky: A (Self) Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
