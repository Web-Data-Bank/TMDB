Parsifal is a strange and enigmatic work. At the end of his life, did Wagner wish to celebrate asceticism, which he himself had never practised? Did he fall upon his knees before the Cross, as claimed by Nietzsche? And what does the secret society of knights based on pure blood signify, desperately waiting for the saviour to regenerate it? What is the true nature of the opposition between the worlds of Klingsor and the Grail? What can Parsifal tell us today? In his artistic will and testament, Wagner condenses his moral idea of the world and returns to the roots of love and religion - to the very heart of art according to him.  With the participation of conductor Hartmut Haenchen who is passionated by the score, Italian stage director Romeo Castellucci proposes an original reading of this brilliant work and explores the essence of Wagnerian ‘Kunstreligion’ in a different light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tzAbrGt9mRnUlmBabzwso6fLnmG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parsifal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
