The bad guy takes out one balloon quickly. It's not clear what kind of balloons these are, since they are sealed like hydrogen/helium balloons, but a good thwack on the top by the bad guy sends Alice and Julius plummeting to the ground, balloon still intact. Julius makes some attempts to re-launch, but they fail. He spots a hippo, smoking nearby, and has an idea: using some pepper, he creates a massive sneeze that re-launches them. But he wasn't onboard. Alice throws down a rope ladder, but it isn't anchored; Julius eventually pulls himself up with a rope. They are then immediately under attack by a lightning storm, which deflates the balloon. Julius makes substitutes from, first, a weiner dog and a couple of empty thought balloons, then, an elephant with extra air pumped in. He grabs a passing bird and catches up to the bad guy, then finds himself in another battle with lightning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gIPxbcvYKf6AbR8kuuZrWFzIQPH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walt Disney Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice's Balloon Race","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":8}
