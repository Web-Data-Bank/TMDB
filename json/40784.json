While Alice inspects the troops, the opposing army (made up of mice) fires its cannons. Julius is hit and knocked completely apart; he's picked up and brought to the hospital where they put him back together with a healthy helping of spare parts. The stalwart cat returns to the field and, using a fan and a piece of strong-smelling cheese, lures the mice out of their trench, clubbing them on the head as they arrive with his multifunctional tail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wFKJMJdC21eIhew6kjbvScTpuZC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice's Little Parade","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":5}
