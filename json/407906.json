On the 35th anniversary of his becoming an entertainer Matsudaira Ken chose to honor his mentor, the legendary superstar Katsu Shintaro by portraying Zato Ichi, the Blind Swordsman in a play based on the original film on the same stage that Katsu had played the role 40 years before in a stage presentation.
