Ronald Sams (Wilson) has lusted after the flirtatious sexpot they call Peaches (Robinson) for a good two decades. After a chance meeting with the object of his lusty affections, the once-devoted family man becomes singularly fixated on making his deepest fantasies a reality. But what Ronald doesn't realize that despite her saccharine name and seductive smile, this stunner isn't so sweet on the inside - in fact, she's downright dangerous. Increasingly isolated from his friends and family as a result of his longtime hang-up, Ronald must now scramble to make things right with those he loves before jealousy and hurt feelings lead to long-term resentment.","popularity":1.228,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whale Watchin' Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peaches","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
