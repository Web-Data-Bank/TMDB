Suddenly, the lights go off, and the lift gets stuck between two floors. In the dark and unable to get any help, the father pushes his son through the narrow space between the shaft and the hallway. Alone in the claustrophobic box, the father and daughter stay silent, until a childish whining is heard from the shadows. Someone is inside the elevator... breathing by their side.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/yDu85qCIQhvLSFkLftx1GCVUHqI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nerdhaus Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2010-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Someone is inside the elevator... breathing by their side.","title":"Man in a Bag","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
