Denis (Hugues Quester is a designer who resorts to selling drugs to survive, but now his drug bosses give him the length of one day to come up with the money he owes them, or else. His son Pierrot (Pierre Champenois) goes along with him, as the two frantically move from one end of town to the other, trying to collect from a wide variety of people: a Vietnamese heroin addict, a dealer and musician, and others on the fringe. In the meantime, Denis' period of grace is quickly running out, and young Pierrot has received a crash-course on the lower rungs of humanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d2cGT6L2KUG8ugvEBtyAgpWIQbL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visage de chien","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
