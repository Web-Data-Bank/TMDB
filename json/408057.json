Thornton shoots from her window of the Jin Jiang Hotel in Shanghai, the site of Mao's 1972 meeting with Nixon, and projects images from the earlier movie, creating a layered landscape of alienation and dislocation.\r - Description from EAI","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Novel City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
