Perception journeys through the same season of time from each character's point of view, detailing how presumption and mistaken intention leads to great misunderstanding. A moment, revisited from another point of view, takes new dimension--and the line between protagonist and antagonist blurs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Happy Wasteland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Look closer.","title":"Perception","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
