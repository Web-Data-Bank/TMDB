First he moved to Brazil, and later to the USA. He never returned to Portugal. During his 20-year-long exile, he kept an epistolary correspondence with Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen. These letters are a testimony of the profound friendship between the two poets, letters of longing and of desire to “fill years of distance with hours of conversation”. Through excerpts and verses, a dialog is established, revealing their divergent opinions but mostly their strong bond, and their efforts to preserve it until their last breaths.","popularity":0.766,"poster_path":"/82fNWgWy7TyuAn93m1RR99wkpVS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8681,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.R.I.M.
