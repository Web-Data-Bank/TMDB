Philosopher of science Stephen C, Meyer show how the digital code in DNA points powerfully to a designing intelligence behind the origin of life. Unlike previous arguments for intelligent design, DNA By Design presents a radical and comprehensive new case, revealing evidence not merely of individual features of biological complexity but rather of a fundamental constituent of the universe: information. That evidence has been mounting exponentially in recent years, known to scientists in specialized fields but largely hidden from public view. A Cambridge University-trained theorist and researcher, director of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, Dr. Meyer is the first to bring the relevant data together into a powerful demonstration of the intelligence that stands outside nature and directs the path life has taken.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79761,"logo_path":null,"name":"Koinonia House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Origin of Life","title":"DNA By Design","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
