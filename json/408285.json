Dramatically, this opera is tightly constructed, with believable characters in an intense conflict over values and beliefs. And Verdi's music, however early in his career, however distant from triumphs like LA FORSA DEL DESTINO or AIDA, is highly animated, revealing inner turmoil and outer passions with beauty and economy. The ensembles are especially impressive, building to satisfying heights of emotional release for the singers and the audience. And Placido Domingo is a wonder to behold and hear. Even though his original voice was baritone, which he managed to transform into a tenor voice, he doesn't SOUND like a baritone to me. B-U-T his performance is so committed, so deeply interfused with Verdi's music, so generously integrated to the younger singers around him, that the waters part.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iHB684tOxlpGq1MG8D6Pw7awu1W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34,"logo_path":"/GagSvqWlyPdkFHMfQ3pNq6ix9P.png","name":"Sony Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Verdi's NABUCCO, A triumph of Staging, Musicianship and Commitment","title":"Verdi Nabucco","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
