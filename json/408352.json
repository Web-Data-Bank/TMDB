Jung-min starts to show late-night movies at the command of the president and has been seen frequently since one day. The first time he speaks, he gets closer to Jung-min. As he gets closer to Jung-min, Choong-shik feels himself changing, and his appearance changes as well. But it feels like you are out of touch with reality. Choong-cheok ignores those feelings and decides to enjoy the moment. It is because he does not want to miss Jeong-min, who is like an angel from heaven, to Chung-sik, who has been living alone every day since his wife ran away.
