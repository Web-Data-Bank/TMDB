In a dystopian post-communist world, Constantine and his father Atanas share a small flat in a run-down apartment block. A tragic accident has disturbed gravity on Earth beyond repair, so everyone weighing less than 120 kilos flies up into space. With only 60kg body weight, Constantine cannot go outside, nor does he want to. Stuck in the flat, at the mercy of the electrical mood swings of a household gravitational normalizer, Constantine leads an almost normal life. He is content spending the days looking at the world through his window. Until the beautifully plump stewardess moving in next door changes everything.","popularity":2.171,"poster_path":"/ixhB8feLvyLrP1J8Dk6cVLwyxsi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102172,"logo_path":null,"name":"Audio-Video Orfey","origin_country":""},{"id":64275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bulgarian National Film Center","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":102173,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Audio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Getting Fat in a Healthy Way","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":6}
