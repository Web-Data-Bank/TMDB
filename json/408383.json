Salvuccio, the captain, orders the crew to switch off the lights and to cut the engine, as a police patrol will soon be nearby, on the lookout for further landings of illegal immigrants. The crew brings up the nets and silently waits in the dark. In the port of Catania, Ahmed imagines ways of leaving the abandoned boat in which he has been living for five years. At nightfall, he watches a cargo ship unloading goods which are free to circulate throughout Europe. At daybreak, the Alba Angela reaches the port of Catania and berths alongside Ahmed. In this Sicilian town, the illegally fishing trawler, its crew, and the illegal migrant both struggle with poverty, living side by side, in complete ignorance of one another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gpgX94CIwmWgirR5rQOx50uqVBD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57432,"logo_path":"/87nyzjM86z0wopuV63t3NjnCpu2.png","name":"Close Up Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fishing Bodies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
