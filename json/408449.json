You'll learn about the Hebrew writing found in this cave that have been dated 600 B.C. Even the name of the place, Khirbet' Beit Lei, has been carried down for thousands of years and means literally in the Semitic languages, Ruin of the House of Lehi. This film presents a story that will be interesting to anyone who seeks the roots of the Book of Mormon. This find could very well be in the general area where Father Lehi lived before leaving Palestine to come to America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visit Israel with Dr. W.
