Married to a Toronto engineer, Eulalie finds life with him oppressive. Together she and Tom escape to the wilds of Northern Ontario, where they enjoy a brief idyll before being hunted down by her jealous husband. In its narrative and symbolism, The Far Shore deftly explores tensions between women and men, nature and industry, French and English, and art and commerce.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1976-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Far Shore","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
