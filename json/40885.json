The issue is compounded because a number of the soldiers become romantically involved with Japanese women, in defiance of US military policy. Ordinarily an officer who is by-the-book, Gruver must take a position when a buddy of his, an enlisted man Joe Kelly (Red Buttons) falls in love with a Japanese woman Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki) and marries her. Gruver risks his position by serving as best man at the wedding ceremony.","popularity":7.321,"poster_path":"/xSXJDamf9vSb1qOiBhOMjB2soDE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pennebaker Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3473,"logo_path":null,"name":"William Goetz Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"I am not allowed to love.
