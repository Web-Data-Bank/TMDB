The boys get too rowdy at the dinner table, so she dismisses the popular, but permissive, assistant principal. But the boys sneak out and he teaches them outdoors, until Flo turns the garden hose on them and chases the boys into the ice-house, which she locks. After an hour, she sends a bucket of hot coffee in with the assistant principal, but she removes the ladder he uses, stranding him. After another hour, he agrees to surrender, and she releases the boys. He leaves, but love has bloomed in the interim.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Victor","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flo's Discipline","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
