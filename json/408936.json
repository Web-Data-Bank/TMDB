Twink meets Chuck Lightfoot, a noted prizefighter, who falls in love with her at first sight. She tries to avoid falling in love with Chuck, whose wife, Cissie, is a drunken harridan and more than a little bit spiteful. Meanwhile, Twink has secured a job in a singing-dancing act in a Limehouse theater, under the auspices of Roseleaf, who has more than just a protective interest in the girl. The jealous Cissie discovers that Twink's sign-painting father also has a night job as a burglar, and she turns him into the police. While a big success dancing on the stage, the arrest of her father has left her somewhat down in the dumps, and she decides to toss herself into the Thames. Possibly, the now-free Chuck, since Cissie has been killed in an accident, might come along and rescue her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ju3I8jOB9zRCBKW4sApZDuUplUK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42184,"logo_path":null,"name":"John McCormick Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Golden-Headed Little Lover of Limehouse, Who Will Dance Her Way Into Your Heart!","title":"Twinkletoes","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
