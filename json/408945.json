Some pieces are no longer extant (half of chapters 3&amp;6, all of 7, 8, and 9, and the beginning of the 10th and final chapter), but the beginning and end are there as well as enough to follow the action adequately. The surviving Grapevine print is beautifully restored and tinted in spots, although you can tell the print is deteriorated in some of the surviving sections. Basically, an inventor (Josef Swickard, in a role not unlike the one he later played in THE LOST CITY) has created a silencer/muffler for planes to silence any engine sounds, and the bad guys are out to steal the invention and put it to evil use.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d9rNnYR71buy6MDXsKJX8RlTlgJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1928-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eagle of the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
