Then, no longer in costume, he talks with the camerawoman who is filming him, he writes a date and an hour (May 1, 1985, 10 a.m.) on a blackboard and then bursts out in rage at the fact that his girlfriend, Hiromi, has been missing for three days. A few moments of their love story are retraced, before returning to the gloomy desperation of the young man, who walks into the darkness of a night illuminated by neon signs and goes into a long monologue of love, directed at the girl.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5IqBQjdmt32NNVHndXe9CjmYq5Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":5}
