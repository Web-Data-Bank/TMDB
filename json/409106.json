Made entirely with stills, it is a filmic experiment balancing between documentary and fiction, photography and film, where an English woman and her deceased Japanese partner, Hiroshi, lead the way. As Mount Fuji is climbed across geographical, temporal and cultural divides, the narrative unfolds, exploring unexpected paths.","popularity":1.325,"poster_path":"/ZwW7qlfrkxMnANZnAk6zppgUIW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antithesis Films","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ascent","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
