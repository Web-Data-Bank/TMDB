They give up everything they own - including, now, their spare kidneys. For a year, journalist Jon Ronson has exclusively followed the group as they attempt to donate their kidneys to strangers in the UK and the US. But who should they give them to? Where can they advertise? Will the hospitals, the media, and the potential recipients see their gesture as a miracle, or as the self-destructive act of a controversial religious movement? Presented by Jon Ronson.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aidNuIELVg55Ym4iM9dVu9qMQUQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1421,"logo_path":"/uWCPDzKkQnOxQ5spgKpD8wzSIP1.png","name":"World of Wonder","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kidneys for Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
