Upon arriving in a small village, they find an abandoned city with houses, a church, and a fountain spouting clean water, like a miracle of a biblical desert. Tired of and battered by their life as wanderers, the artists decide to settle in the village and start a new community, assigning themselves different roles from those they have played throughout their lives. This new arrangement, however, will reveal these artists the worst vices of the civilian life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k3EvKgyVDkhaG1w3XLdTnrBw3Tg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bananeira Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deserto","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
