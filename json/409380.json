He's a polite and quiet boy, and the local students always make fun of him just because he's from Bangkok. He later becomes friend with Oud, a local bad-boy who is really a good guy inside. Just like any other teenagers, Min falls in love at first sight with Fang, a pretty girl from the same school, but this love is going to be tough because of the opposition of Fang's father.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":80005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bell Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2006-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Friend","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
