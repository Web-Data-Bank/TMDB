This artistic movement was directly connected not only with important art centers of the former Yugoslavia, but also with existing flows of world art during its brief and productive activities (7e Biennale de Paris, 19th Berlinale). The cultural and artistic emancipation of that time had implied individual freedom of expression and strong reaction to established boundaries. This avant-garde movement had become threat to communist establishment, the authors' work were sabotaged, the films were sealed off, five artists were taken to trial, two were sent in prison. How is it that the retrograde mechanism of shutting down and removing the most creative and representative progressive impulses of our surrounding is still so current to this day?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nezavisni Filmski Centar Kino Klub Novi Sad","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":80039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Druga linija","origin_country":""},{"id":80040,"logo_path":null,"name":"MrV Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2016-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
