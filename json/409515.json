Her rather lonely existence is characterized by hard work and poverty and as her mother's condition worsens there doesn't seem to be a way out anymore. Ecce homo is a parable about being human, rich in religious symbolism, which dreamily and at the same time sombrely poses existential questions without volunteering answers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qDbpFLfaZiHqLxlrkQp6EJkZVwB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edinburgh Skillset Screen and Media Academy","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ECCE HOMO","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
