It was not until the summer of 1996 that I actually got it together and shot it. Again with the help of Steve Creson we packed up all our equipment and loaded on to a plane and flew to Arizona were we rented a car and drove around the desert for week and filmed everything that we thought looked interesting. This film is similar to the films in my urban landscapes series, only this film was shot in eye popping full color and there are no man made elements in this film at all. Lots of rock formations, colors, and shapes only things made my mother nature. This film also has a film score by RUBATO.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1ogadBvibZTX3oxqoMzrePojvmo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desert Abstractions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
