It’s a filmed documentation of the verbs “to appear” and “to disappear”.  This film challenges itself by trying to make visible und perceptible these unseizable and sometimes invisible subjects. Apariciones is a collage-shortfilm, an associative definition, a visual thinking process, a physics of illusions.\r This short film uses a variety of different mechanical, chemical and digital techniques. It was partially filmed with quite \"normal\" film cameras such as the Bolex and ARRI Alexa. However, in the animation scenes several different photo cameras were used: a Canon 50D for instance, which was fitted with a self-made telephoto lens made of cardboard; a cardboard pinhole camera; a large-format Sinar camera 4x5 inches and a small-format reflex cameras Nikon FM and Canon 5D.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apparitions","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
