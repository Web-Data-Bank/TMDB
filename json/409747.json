The sailor takes the lively, direct character of the girl for windiness and frivolity. Sokolova also reacted frowningly and mockingly to the satellite. To get to know each other better, travelers are helped by nuisance: they are behind the train, and the rest of the way they are together, getting to know people and the life of the country along the way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jZlHCUiCgHy8Oj9WDbHtQYuhQlS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1948-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Train Goes East","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
