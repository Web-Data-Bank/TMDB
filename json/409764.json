Filmed in 1979 and 1980, it was first shown on CBC in 1980. It is a warm, affectionate, and revealing 90-minute tribute that focuses on the 1979 tour, the “New Skin” and “Recent Songs” albums and “Death of a Lady’s (and Ladies) Man” book and album. In a highly entertaining fashion, it intercuts live music segments with Cohen comments on life and sometimes on his poems and songs. As with other Cohen items, this film seems more entertaining, and filled with more profundity, viewing after viewing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Song of Leonard Cohen","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
