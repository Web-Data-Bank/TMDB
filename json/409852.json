Having returned to reality from an inner voyage to death and back in a comaâ€“like state he finds himself abandoned in a cold and unforgiving world devoid of purpose. As memories of his lover slowly reform and solidify in his mind he sets out on a journey to rediscover the distant and immediately recent events that lead to his hospitalization. Told through the lucid perception of the protagonist, Inanimate explores the fractured psyche of a man grappling with the horror of uncertainty and ultimately asks how you could choose to live where there is nothing to live for.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inanimate","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
