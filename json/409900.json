Through the children, their biological parents and foster parents, the film depicts love in everyday life. The film explores the invisible bond between a child and a biological parent. Even when a child is taken into custody, the yearning for closeness to the biological parents and need for their approval never seems to disappear. This longing is a form of loneliness that the foster parents struggle to overcome. The film describes the entire foster care process: a child being brought into a shelter home, a teenagerâ€™s everyday life in a foster family, and siblings preparing to return to their biological mother, after five years in a foster family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/66AJg0TU25AkBvkyKltwddcrRrR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avanton Productions Oy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"About children and parents.
