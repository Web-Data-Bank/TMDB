He attempts to ascertain what Islam's Holy Book actually says about such subjects as equality, punishment, peace, other faiths and suicide bombing. As with most holy books, the paradoxes contained within lead to an extremely wide range of interpretations, and as such can be \"used for ultimate grace or as an alibi for appalling acts and beliefs.\" Thomas investigates how Islam's teachings in the Koran are very tactfully being employed by nations and powerful leaders alike to further their own political, cultural, and social norms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mXVgBpTJt5OQry91bYPkEsoUgUA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside the Koran","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3}
