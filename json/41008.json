Wildlife is wound into striking novellas by shedding light on the inner life of the forest’s inhabitants.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lA347YHMn17tBg6lc3tIntaVkFU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magyar Híradó és Dokumentumfilmgyár","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1954-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Blossom Time to Autumn Frost","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":3}
