He takes an unusual interest in one of his party girl flings, and can't shake her from his thoughts. Her presence stirs up the repressed Anima archetype from his hardened psyche. The influx of feeling she invokes breaks the man down into tears of desperation, he then feels instinctively drawn to the forest. There, in the primordial environment, he glimpses a vision of life which momentarily obliterates his ever-seeking Will and invokes a glimpse of the innate wisdom of the Self. And the rest, is silence!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cycle de Vie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
