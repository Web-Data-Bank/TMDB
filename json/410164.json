Live From The Kodak Theatre","overview":"Ultimate Manilow comprises two different versions of the same television special. The first disc offers the singer/songwriter's CBS special as it originally aired (of course without commercial interruptions). The second disc offers a wealth of footage that was recorded between songs, and features performances cut out of the original broadcast. Barry Manilow himself offers a commentary track on this extended version of the concert. The sound has been recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1. Supplemental materials include lyrics to the songs, a biography of the artist, a Manilow discography, and a still photo gallery. This is a fabulous release for any fan of Manilow's distinctive sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barry Manilow: Ultimate Manilow!
