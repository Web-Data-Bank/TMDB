A TV set takes part in the conversation, and, meticulously controlled backstage, interrupts them abruptly with several images in which women will be a permanent fixture. The director is lurking behind, listening for her character’s comments and ready to reveal to us a collection of historical symptoms. In a time of highly mediatized combat against sexism, in Brazil emerges an action movie, with lots of ammunition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9azhqvzPEgFXv5EHK3X5epbAJro.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chamber of Mirrors","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
