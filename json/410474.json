We don't have anything against some occasional comfort food. We actually quite enjoy it. But constant unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are silent killers responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. It happens slowly, but eventually it happens, and sadly those deaths never end up on the front page of the newspapers. This is our small contribution to World Health Day. To raise awareness on this important issue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gCvj7dhdlrYKuzGgAofnzbwrGId.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Food For Thought","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
