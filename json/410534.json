Nowhere is that more true than in Poland with their beloved Arabian horse. This is the strange, unexpected story of far-flung lands as disparate as Egypt and the long-suffering Slavic kingdom of Poland coming together in war and in peace and influencing one another through the living history written on the backs of centuries of horses. This breathtaking film documents the unlikely, triumphant story of Poland's entrance onto the world stage via their worldwide influence on the breeding of one animal; how a beleaguered nation rose up to become the pinnacle of Arabian horse breeding, coming full circle from desert sands to the hallowed halls of Europe.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/f3FyNQ20JW1DFOMlQHxb5IBa6kM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80193,"logo_path":"/rDZNmLlfTdguRkRQRBM4NL5G46u.png","name":"Horsefly Films Rare Equine Trust","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The unlikely triumphant saga of the illustrious horses that are a Polish National treasure and how a beleaguered nation rose up to become the pinnacle of Arabian horse breeding.","title":"Path to Glory: The Rise and Rise of the Polish Arabian Horse","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
