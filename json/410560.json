Here we have the whole performance, up to three hours. I could not stop watching these discs. Let me say this much; Levine has done for the Met, making it the premier opera house in the world, what Karajan did with the Berlin, making it one of the finest orchestras ever. So sit back and enjoy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9NMiQzncElgMs3B9voJptXftU5q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":294,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Highlights of a memorable evening at the MET","title":"Metropolitan Opera Gala James Levine's 25th Anniversary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
