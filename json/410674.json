When we hear a story that seems mysterious or far-fetched, we put more trust in its accuracy the longer ago it took place. As the centuries pass, the truth becomes more malleable. We grow less skeptical of what we might otherwise dismiss as incredible. Our perspective changes. This film addresses the eerie transformation of a familiar myth when displaced to the present.","popularity":0.869,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chris Ward Julie Snyder Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":85184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roman Way Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":182008,"logo_path":null,"name":"Create \u0026 Complete Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bastard","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":8}
