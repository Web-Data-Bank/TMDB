It contains three stories: Antonio Cacto, Lighthouse and The Big Man, plus three ultra-short films called Charge the Dragon.  Each episode uses different production technology and is in a different genre, but both their form and their content are related. All the episodes are about double standards and the topics of heroism and death. Something very small meets something very big (a tiny knight meets a huge dragon, an old Mexican goblin meets a man, a tiny Professor meets real-life cows, two mobsters meet the Big Man). All these meetings result in the heroic death of the small principal characters. Each script sees heroism and death differently.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AuOQJ60MK8lZmTK6vKMDytjyFab.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Total HelpArt T.H.A.","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":79194,"logo_path":"/8oMbGTDI42i6v4e11AjHcgJHp73.png","name":"PubRes","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":117637,"logo_path":null,"name":"R.U.R.","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":117638,"logo_path":null,"name":"AT Studio","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":6105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soundsquare","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2016-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murderous Tales","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
