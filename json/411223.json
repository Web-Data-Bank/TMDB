First Lady of the Revolution is the remarkable story of Henrietta Boggs, who fell in love with a foreign land and the man destined to transform its identity. Her marriage to Jose ‘Don Pepe’ Figueres in 1941 led to a decade-long journey through activism, exile and political upheaval and, ultimately, lasting progressive reforms.  First Lady of the Revolution is not only a depiction of the momentous struggle to shape Costa Rica’s democratic identity; it’s also a portrayal of how a courageous woman escaped the confines of a traditional, sheltered existence to expand her horizons into a new world, and live a life she never imagined.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v0k4gX60xsEig9SJsDXbc4pEbvC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10081,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spark Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A southern belle's journey through love, exile, and revolution.","title":"First Lady of the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1}
