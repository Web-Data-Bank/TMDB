As he trains for the title fight, the trash-talking, steroid-taking champ Spencer “Timber” Collier played by Allen Maldonado (“Straight Outta Compton,” “Black-ish”) does everything he can to take Jaxon off his game. The stakes are high and family drama, thirsty groupies, and a manager with a serious gambling problem are all vying for Jaxon’s attention, making it difficult for him to stay focused on the task at hand – winning the belt. In the midst of being pushed to the limit both physically and mentally, Jaxon meets a beautiful photographer Endira (Raney Branch; “The Originals,” “Grey’s Anatomy”) who captures his heart while hiding a devastating secret.","popularity":0.853,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ringside","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
