It has written Comedy, Romance etc... but, this movie doesn't include anything funny, I believe.  After I see the movie, I thought that love springs through a one's heart and it has its own spirit. It doesn't have to have any company. The matter is if it coincides its mate; that's it.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/wvfeqlMlmhqlKMF9thFUP3JFTwB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scorpio Eats Gemini for Breakfast","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
