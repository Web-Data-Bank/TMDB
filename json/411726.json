In Donegan's almost psychedelic renditions, a silver-garbed, red-wigged performer capers in a theatrical non-space of foil, plastic, police tape, and rescanned video images of Tommy star Ann-Margret. In Channeling in 4 Versions, actress Garland Hunter enacts the scene, and then, in a silent version (Channeling in 5 Versions), Donegan herself takes the role.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Channeling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
