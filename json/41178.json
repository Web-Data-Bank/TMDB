The only problem is that she has neither the talent nor the drive for her goal. One day she runs away from home and shacks up with her friend Dong Ho. Together, they form a band in hopes of entering the upcoming music competition. Despite Dong Ho's obvious signs of affection, Soo Yeon turns her eyes to a smooth-talking musician though she is too blind to see his ulterior motives. No money, no talent, and no strings to pull.
