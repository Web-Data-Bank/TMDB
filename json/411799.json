The amazing thing is that Zappa allowed a guy with a camera to film the band at the Fillmore West w/ Flo and Eddie. There are times when the camera man seems to be on the stage. The performance is recorded from only one camera angle. There are only 4-5 songs presented here.....and Zappa referring to the Fillmore West as the ‘Psychedelic Dungeon’ is priceless………..It is a great piece of history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/76LZmlN10C0ciTFrA5Apx0pHQPp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vrijzinnig Protestantse Radio Omroep (VPRO)","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1971-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frank Zappa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
