It is not - I repeat, NOT - a hoax, perpetrated by some headline-grabbing deviant. You see, my years of research into the physical, and often violent and deadly, manifestations of diseases of the human mind has led me on a dark and harrowing journey in search of the truth, no matter how unbelievable, how terrifying it may prove to be. What you hold in your hand at this very moment is indeed a rarity - authentic, documented proof that the horrible fate which befell a young heroin addict named Johnny Schaeffer was the consequence of a sick and disturbed brain, ravaged by drugs and confounded by mystical mumbo-jumbo. Nonetheless, the outcome remains unfathomable and the answers unthinkable. I bid you be warned. The truth can be ugly...and grisly and blood-soaked and unstoppable, far beyond your most gruesome and frightful imaginations.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales of the Urban Werewolf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
