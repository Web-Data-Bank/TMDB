The girls quickly work their way through the team of counselors. The sex is sleazy, free, fast and loose - and brings back a time when the only people who even thought of using condoms were those whose girls weren't on the pill. Featuring the seldom-seen but fabulous Barbara Klouds - this is far and wide agreed to be some of her best work indeed.  (The movie credits Joanna Williams as Writer and Director, but that is a sobriquet for Maria Lease.)","popularity":2.147,"poster_path":"/jTKfBJ8vS0nD8NXhqRzcToIblmo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rainbow Spectrum","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1955,"logo_path":null,"name":"VCX","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Come Play with Us","title":"Little Girls Blue 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
