Fretting over his wife's ticking clock, Dave happens upon Ruby, a tempestuous beauty on the run with a mean-looking baby on her arm while toting a gun. Thus begins a series of capers that revolve around the helpless, yet, testy baby, a strapping town sheriff, a gun-loving bounty hunter and a snitching clown. All are involved in an ever-twisting plot in a quest for ownership of the baby Lloyd. The all night journey ultimately provides all characters their unsought solutions towards the lives they've been wanting.","popularity":2.378,"poster_path":"/xdsNHmnumJjhtYrdA6E4VGeomkw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dry Cycle","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
