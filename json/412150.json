Her nickname Bloody Luna was a reference  to her incredibly brutal methods of interrogation. In the early 1960s, she appears in a centre for the blind on the outskirts of  Warsaw, a place often visited by Cardinal Wyszyński, whose imprisonment in 1953-1956 Brystiger supervised personally. During a difficult and heated discussion with the cardinal, Brystiger denounces the communist ideology and begs for forgiveness for her crimes and for guidance in her search for God.","popularity":1.058,"poster_path":"/upISfxpsScJh3spfeyxnPRI2bor.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72891,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministerstwo Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego","origin_country":""},{"id":72548,"logo_path":"/mByJIaYKm9P2hImj0D2jvWNTlR1.png","name":"Kino Świat","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2016-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zacma: Blindness","video":false,"vote_average":6.773,"vote_count":11}
