Through the series, Koike has shot a huge amount – thousands – of still photos of objective motifs, from ocean creatures, microbes, and granite to artificial material such as fishing nets. Those photos are developed with a specialized method then reshot with movie film. The style has been thoroughly continued. The images that are created as a result tower before our eyes as an overwhelming visual experience. Each motif has been repeatedly decomposed and reconstructed of its \"attribution\" and \"meaning\", causing a shocking Gestalt breakdown for the audience.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/3OKmUZZjnab1TKNzJMESVAroZPt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Voyant Cinémathèque","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1988-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ecosystem 5 ~ A Tremulous Stone","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
