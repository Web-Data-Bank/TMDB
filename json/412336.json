Goldoni originally wrote the play at the request of actor Antonio Sacco, one of the great Truffaldinos in history. His earliest drafts had large sections that were reserved for improvisation, but he revised it in 1789 in the version that exists today.[1] The play draws on the tradition of the earlier Italian commedia dell'arte.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cGD54GzK0AT7YAFshj6Q4Eq144x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1955-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Servant of Two Masters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
