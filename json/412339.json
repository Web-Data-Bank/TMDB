Yet millions are embracing the foolishness of atheism. “The Atheist Delusion” pulls back the curtain and reveals what is going on in the mind of those who deny the obvious. It introduces you to a number of atheists who you will follow as they go where the evidence leads, find a roadblock, and enter into a place of honesty that is rarely seen on film.","popularity":2.719,"poster_path":"/qqNnlpGdTzMfD8AsxJCf06B3zPu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Why Millions Deny the Obvious","title":"The Atheist Delusion","video":false,"vote_average":1.679,"vote_count":14}
