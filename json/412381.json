Unfortunately, Izuru Hitachi, the leader of Team Rabbits who defeated the Wulgaru Royal Jiart, is still out of action and recovering, so the task of marshalling the Majestic Princes and stopping Diorna falls upon the unready shoulders of Toshikazu Asagi. Together with the remaining members of Team Rabbits and the recently created Team Fawn, it's up to Asagi to hold the line against the most ruthless adversary yet!","popularity":1.776,"poster_path":"/gZTdGghb7EArLG9KAM2iMo4Z8Qo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61406,"logo_path":"/u1sxXN7a01hlsD4H01kzz6gELOn.png","name":"Orange","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":882,"logo_path":"/iDw9Xxok1d9WAM2zFicI8p3khTH.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":4719,"logo_path":"/b3smsDQQ2UEwqToJbVTlT4kgXBk.png","name":"Sotsu","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12502,"logo_path":"/tlBbCuZditAuvzDdIDjjnGLJUpc.png","name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":60196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fields Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Majestic Prince: Genetic Awakening","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
