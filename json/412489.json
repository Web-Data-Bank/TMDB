From the ridiculous to the sublime, her astonishing but often controversial magazine covers have not only broken the rules but also set the high bar for fashion, art and commerce over the past 25 years. From the legendary “Black Issue\" and the “Plastic Surgery issue\" Sozzani remains deeply committed to exploring subject matter off limits to most in order to shake up the status quo and occasionally redefine the concept of beauty.","popularity":3.488,"poster_path":"/4pgiWFz7LsKdLgp0Ug6Hjf1B4Aj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66478,"logo_path":"/u7WmMkfo9MqsqfD5cuDAbd0u1qY.png","name":"Artemis Rising","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Disarming Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":120901,"logo_path":null,"name":"LDM Comunicazione","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Franca: Chaos and Creation","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":24}
