Structured around five key vignettes in this history, Lerner’s film combines travelogues, newsreels, and educational films to examine the claims of various experts like early-20th century “dean of the Mayanists” Sylvanus G. Morley and archaeologist Michael Coe, longtime curator of Yale’s Peabody Museum of Natural History.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
