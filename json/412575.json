AUX QUATRE COINS includes an original device that immediately sets itself apart from any other classic narrative form. These first experiments were silent films with intertitles. AUX QUATRE COINS does not have any intertitles but black images between a few shots. Rivette offers the viewer intriguing visual forms, encouraging him to imagine his own story.
