The film featured four actors: two women and two men, one of them Godard. According to Rivette, “It ran 40 minutes and nothing happens. It’s just four people sitting around a table, looking at each other. After ten minutes, people started to leave, and at the end, the only ones who stayed were Jean-Luc and a girl.” (Richard Brody)","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/p6rdyrvDqpx9VZP1iuwgyAMjLAM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Quadrille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
