The mountain rises up like a wall blocking out the sun that never reaches their fields below, now reduced to just stones and underbrush. Agostino, even though everything suggests him to leave, decides that the destiny of his family is there, among the peaks. He is not only driven by stubbornness, but by the certainty that our roots cannot betray us and that with the help of our spirit we can bring the sun on every destiny.","popularity":0.912,"poster_path":"/bSkYfLN640wAFIA5aBnX3NbFy5y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineric","origin_country":""},{"id":16826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Citrullo International","origin_country":""},{"id":80781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zivago Media","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":2622,"logo_path":"/2ZWtZLYbuQVPNvLJNv85uhEhZkO.png","name":"Cin√©-Sud Promotion","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":9}
