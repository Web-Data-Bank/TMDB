Every period, whether class, meals, recess, exams, workshop or sports, any activity they find at school leads them into wild choreography. Derived from the ElektroKif stage show choreographed by Blanca Li, which has extensively toured around the world, Elektro High School is an urban dance musical unlike any you have ever seen. Full of humor, sensibility and without any dialogues, it is a statement about what it is to be at school today, and how be an electro dancer. Electro Dance, the first dance genre to be born in France since Can-Can, is one of the most original urban dance styles, getting hot among high school students from around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hAxXoUbqk2vGZmiixsJIgOF4nzo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106235,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Addict","origin_country":""},{"id":106236,"logo_path":null,"name":"St. George","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elektro Mathematrix","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
