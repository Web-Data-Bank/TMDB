Catalogues and building sets made by the American toy companies Aurora and Lindberg report on the ways they are misused for imperialist manipulation. The film particularly emphasizes the rehabilitation and propagation of the German imperialist military tradition, which is seen as responsible for destroying humanistic viewpoints and replacing them with perverted and sadistic attitudes towards humanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u9jUhHzm5LIOhWhB0pS9i2ooCbg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fine Toys â€“ Made in USA","video":false,"vote_average":5.167,"vote_count":6}
