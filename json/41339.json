Stephanie Soechtig's debut feature is an unflinching examination of the big business of bottled water. From the producers of Who Killed the Electric Car and I.O.U.S.A., this timely documentary is a behind-the-scenes look into the unregulated and unseen world of an industry that aims to privatize and sell back the one resource that ought never to become a commodity: our water. From the plastic production to the ocean in which so many of these bottles end up, this inspiring documentary trails the path of the bottled water industry and the communities which were the unwitting chips on the table. A powerful portrait of the lives affected by the bottled water industry, this revelatory film features those caught at the intersection of big business and the public's right to water.","popularity":1.416,"poster_path":"/cTtxy5UrTHuneR0OCHwU4VLReQg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tapped","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":20}
