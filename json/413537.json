In her quasi-documentary, Agnieszka Polska re-enacts the strike. Juxtaposing its inherent inaction, not far removed from an artistic performance, with animations showing the humdrum character of everyday creative work, the artist poses a question about the social effectiveness of the artistsâ€™ efforts. The film was awarded Grand Prix of the Minister of Culture and National Heritage in the 10th Geppert Competition (2011).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How the Work Is Done","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
