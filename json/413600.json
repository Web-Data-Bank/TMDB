One of the most eagerly awaited films to come out of Greece in recent years, Sofia Exarchou's feature debut is a coming-of-age story that presents a summertime idyll from the perspective of Athenian youths. It allows us to see the fragility they try to conceal, and at the same time shows them to be unwaveringly resilient despite the socio-economic troubles that affect their destinies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eLlOhbyWcV9MIk5nfFENww79e77.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86772,"logo_path":"/zaRXAxVMdactH2HLKegbmm7FdOx.png","name":"Neda Film","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":19246,"logo_path":"/4zrEZfTf94tyG4wRB599gRS0reU.png","name":"Faliro House Productions","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":86773,"logo_path":"/lbjAsmIuOcIEFJG2WRSz1NUAXvi.png","name":"Madants","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2016-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Park","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":11}
