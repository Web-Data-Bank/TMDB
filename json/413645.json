A documentary made by nature photographer Andoni Canela with his family is narrated by his young son who shares his experiences and observations as they camp in jungles, deserts, and glaciers in search of wolves, elephants, lions, bison, penguins, hornbills and crocodiles. Seen through the boy's eyes, their journey across all continents conveys an innocent and unconditional love of nature and reveals an urgency to protect the delicate diversity of our planet's wildlife. Breathtaking cinematography and an insider's view on the daily life of a professional photographer on assignment enhance the documentary's story of a family learning, playing, and living on a trip of a lifetime together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":80939,"logo_path":"/reyIdDf4M6BNii26BGS7w78vwpl.png","name":"WWF España","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":80940,"logo_path":null,"name":"OHM Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":80941,"logo_path":null,"name":"P.A.U.
