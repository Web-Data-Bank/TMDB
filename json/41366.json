The night they hit Dynaphase Systems, two dirty employees are staying late using company resources to develop their own plans for a security microchip worth millions of dollars.

When Bishop discovers the value of the stolen, but partially erased information, he sets out after the rest of the chip design, letting nothing stand in his way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/clEMrRyifqaENOE7dEg3M0rrNsi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8900,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Carousel Picture Company","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New World Disorder","video":false,"vote_average":2.9,"vote_count":5}
