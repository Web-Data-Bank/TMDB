They have no children. When Hagar, a young horn player from East Jerusalem joins the Orchestra, Sarah's world erupts. A unique friendship evolves between the two women. Hagar, feeling Sarah’s pain from not having children, offers to have a baby for Sarah. Ismail, born to Hagar and Abraham, is a wild and gifted pianist whom Sarah raises as her own. When Ismail discovers the true identity of his mother, his world – and that of those around him – falls apart. Harmonia maintains the unique essence of the biblical story from Genesis and adds a personal and human perspective.","popularity":0.677,"poster_path":"/dHjR2pD6iyCgpr7vXJCp356URYg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inosan Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harmonia","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
