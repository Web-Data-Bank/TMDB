One in Osnago, the other in Mendrisio, they have been dedicating themselves for years to valuable editorial and typographical activities, still printing with mobile characters, preserving the memory of a perfect ingenuity made of manual skills and technique, but also of inventiveness and poetry. Silvio Soldini gives us a realistic and poetical portrait of these two artists-artisans, who chose one of the oldest professions in a modern world, finding great success and approval.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xN06X5tTpGJXQYFcGMe0i5pWn4d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10358,"logo_path":"/pvgiWovEFHYoOO49V7arAhitWTM.png","name":"Ventura Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il fiume ha sempre ragione","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
