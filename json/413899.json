The portrayal of the characters is similar in many ways to Malayalam cinema's investigative thrillers. The suspense is well maintained until the climax with little clue to the audience on the identity of the real culprit. The arguments in court were mostly inspired from 12 Angry Men (1957).","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/yuVmnOsBsIRC8NZT5NdCWy0RKVB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46251,"logo_path":null,"name":"K.
