Rogers is that rarity, a country singer/songwriter who records with his road band instead of the usual session musicians, which gives his albums a relaxed, rough-edged feel missing from the standard antiseptic Music Row product.  The set climaxes with an extended workout on \"Lost and Found,\" from Rogers' debut, showcasing a series of solos brief enough to keep from devolving into tiresome showboating.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c2WfkCe6wWOc4coIYEZqh4uWcnT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Randy Rogers Band:  Live at Billy Bob's Texas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
