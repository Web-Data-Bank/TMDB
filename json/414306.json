Exploring their history, challenges, art form, influences and experiences that led them to activism, the documentary will provide an understanding of the realities of life as a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault. Though the film will tell each story honestly, mixing visuals of the artist at work, voiceover interviews describing events and dramatic actor re-enactments, the overall message will highlight how each artist has turned something so ugly into something beautiful that inspires hope.","popularity":0.809,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":81077,"logo_path":null,"name":"My Love For Writing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Art As A Voice is a feature-length documentary examining how five female artists use their artwork to effect change.","title":"Art As A Voice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
