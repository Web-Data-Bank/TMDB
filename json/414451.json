One of the brothers is wheelchair-bound and eventually makes the acquaintance of the pizza-driving aspirant and decides to give him the money he needs -- though this act of generosity in no way shields him from his own destiny. Other characters wander in and out of the story, such as Jeanne (Martine Kalayan), the young man's lover.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Side Roads","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
