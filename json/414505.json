One of Edgar's friends thinks he has a way for Edgar to go hunting with them. He should pretend to join the National Guard, who are holding a two week camp. In reality, Edgar will have only rented a uniform to convince Vivien that he has joined. Two things may threaten Edgar's plan. First, Vivien, regardless of if she trusts her husband or not, may want to see him off at the train station, which would force him onto the train going to the guard camp. And second, if he can fool Vivien that he is joining the National Guard, he may have also convinced the National Guard that he has joined for real. But in carrying out his plan, Edgar may get into even bigger trouble.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drafted in the Depot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
