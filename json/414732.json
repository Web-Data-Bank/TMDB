Miss Chief Eagle Testickle (the outrageous alter ego of Cree artist Kent Monkman), forces innocent naked white men to become her figure models, seduces them with whiskey, and when she’s done with them, dresses them up as more “authentic” examples of the “European male.” Shot on the grounds of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario, Group of Seven Inches subverts the subjectivity and authority of colonial art history and everything else it can get its hands on.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A3Ty1WVxBmyWkOJPNqW1GpJoKvC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Group of Seven Inches","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
