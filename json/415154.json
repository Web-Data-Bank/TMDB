The only person aware of this is Serena, an eccentric fifty-year-old chambermaid who still has a smile on her face despite a difficult life. As she cleans, Serena asks the room about the fate of her deceased husband in the afterlife and the room appears, somewhat confusedly, to answer her. A surreal dialogue ensues, during which Serena talks about her own and other peopleâ€™s sins, and frankly tackles a fundamental theme of Christian morality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stanza 52","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
