She falls in love with that genuine first love, which is only possible when you're 19 years old. She does not suspect that for such an ambitious aesthetic as Valerik, this is just another episode in an endless celebration of life. The leitmotif of the film, which became a cultural landmark for several generations of people born in Leningrad - St. Petersburg, is the natural scenery of the beautiful city on the Neva river at the beginning of the sixties.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nbD13pCl3D4qmOwFTPkboz26xaF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lentelefilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1969-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell to White Nights","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
