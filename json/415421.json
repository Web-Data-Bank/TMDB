At a Christmas party, Masha is given a seemingly alive Nutcracker by her Uncle Drosselmeyer, and Masha instantly is enchanted with it. The toys come to life at midnight, and after Masha helps the Nutcracker defeat attacking mice, he takes her to his kingdom, where he is later revealed to be a handsome Prince. The Prince and Masha fall deeply in love, but their \"happy ending\" has a morbid twist not found in any other \"Nutcracker\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":71932,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mariinsky Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2008-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nutcracker","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
