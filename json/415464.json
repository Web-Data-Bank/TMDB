They had occupied a watchtower against unreasonable redevelopment policies and in protest against violent suppression used by riot police in 25 hours of their sit-in demonstration.

The ‘comrades’ rip out cruel words while blaming each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lKQnXOkQygY9wA3Uoz5c7ncRGTK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atnine Film","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":53366,"logo_path":"/5fbWZ4BsG9gh50cay7lOj5aKguu.png","name":"Cinema Dal","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":50413,"logo_path":null,"name":"PINKS","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2018-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Remnants","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
