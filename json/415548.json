Due to his progressive ideas, he is transferred to a small town. The village environment is even more depressing than his former surroundings were, as the influence of both the secular and the Church authorities is even greater in the country. Even though Martin meets Tončka and the two of them get married, he gradually becomes a disillusioned and embittered man. In time, when society's strictures become somewhat milder, Martin is transferred to a more friendly environment, but all the injustices he has experienced have already bitten too deep. Unlike his wife, Martin finds it very difficult to accept changes. When his son dies, it seems as though he has lost all his elan and the will to live. Will he be able to go on bringing the light of knowledge to the ignorant masses, or will his ideals be buried forever like a man in a snowdrift?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hdD4n5tiEcPoRtNDpW1kZaytRDt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viba Film","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1976-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Idealist","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
