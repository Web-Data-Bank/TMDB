The sport derives from ritual manhood trials and has developed into a national sport with packed stadiums and huge prizes. Today, the fight is supplemented with bare knuckle boxing but without any protection. The 22­-year-­old cattle herder Ndoff has been chosen to compete in an annual talent event in Dakar, and faces a possible breakthrough as a pro wrestler. LAAMB is the story of a sport filled with myths and extreme voodoo rituals, and a modern tale about fighting one’s way out of poverty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yfRLbES4wl6XsZ0sCAjfclKitXb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"2013-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laamb","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
