All enemies of the state are dealt in the harshest way. Most of them are executed by the secret government’s assassins. The best operative is code-named “Condor” – an elite agent and hit man for the government. However, in his latest assignment, “Condor” fails to kill an opposition leader, and finds himself on the run from the very same government agency that he works for. This sets in motion a chain of events with unforseen consequences for all involved.","popularity":8.435,"poster_path":"/8bFIPM8PatqvwtNO9ObjQ6PBDky.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boundless Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arramis Films","origin_country":""},{"id":23688,"logo_path":null,"name":"VMI Worldwide","origin_country":""},{"id":56647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paar Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":112544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inopia Films","origin_country":""},{"id":36109,"logo_path":"/wca0Jcidf2N1KAPicYMjGoKOmYu.png","name":"The Fyzz","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-09","revenue":17000000,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everyone is a Target","title":"The Perfect Weapon","video":false,"vote_average":4.055,"vote_count":55}
