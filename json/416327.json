The departure of Hyung-suk, the class rep, leaves a power void in a small classroom. The empty monitor seat sparks a series of small conflicts between Do-jin and Min-gu, two old friends, who also compete for the attention of Suh-yeon. Slowly, their competition grows in intensity. In sensitive times, Dong-il, a new student, transfers in from far away. At his new school, he has nothing to rely on, no friends or family. His only chance is to obtain power. As the class prepares to elect a new rep, the competition turns to war when Dong-il enters the fray. Suh-yeon, who only wanted everybody to get along, becomes the victim of Dong-il’s games.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pqPZwRjjZzh7JKvCYjL3pdvAXhw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sadness in Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
