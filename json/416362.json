David is the local marihuana pusher, but he is the kind of dealer that smokes more than he sells. The country has been hit by a new deathdrug and when David and his partner in crime, Ahmir, are offered some exceptionally cheap cocaine they see it as an opportunity to earn big money to pay their debt. The cocaine turns out to have a terrible side effect that creates a giant zombie outbreak that spreads across the entire Copenhagen. In the film we follow David and his bloody fight out of the city.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark...","title":"Escaping the Dead","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
