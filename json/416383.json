Father Vicente is a chaste monk who fights against all kinds of vices and sins, against superstition and against the beliefs of Muslims and Jews. Carles Mira's first feature film was inspired by the great amount of popular imagery that has provoked the supposed miracles of San Vicente Ferrer. The repertoire includes anecdotes of grotesque and eschatological character with an eminently esperpéntica will.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uky9h7I2aKThuwT6cwEBgaitknu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ascle Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1978-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prodigious Life of Father Vincent","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6}
