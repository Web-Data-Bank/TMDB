Director Christophe Loy has created a thought-provoking and surprisingly original script in which both Constance and Blonda feel respect, admiration and even deep love for their captors. As a result of this tantalizing, torturous approach, traditional norms and concepts of good and evil were turned upside down.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dlfjycABuv2wxjqIWHwWrNvifLH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gran Teatre del Liceu","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":42411,"logo_path":"/9osTYTduHkM6Il6XixUTfdNcaoP.png","name":"C Major Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":188,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Die Entführung aus dem Serail live performance from the Gran Teatre del Liceu, 2011","title":"Mozart: Die Entführung aus dem Serail","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
