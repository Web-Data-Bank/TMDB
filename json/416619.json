Paula Brown (Maureen Connell) is the stripper whom Mike hires to pose as Barbara. It's all part of a scheme to fool Mike's ex-convict dad Sam Roscoe (Mervyn Johns). The son hopes to entice Sam into revealing the whereabouts of his stolen money, and Paula is hopefully going to do the trick. Based on a novel by Jonathan Burke, Echo of Barbara is a better-than-usual British programmer, entertaining despite its surplus of unpleasant leading characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tujTNvaRO8leHfMWCzcDbcA6cRK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Artists","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1961-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echo of Barbara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
