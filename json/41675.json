Demme's affectionate portrait of his cousin traces Castle's story, beginning with his first parish assignment, in New Jersey in the early 1960s, in an increasingly African-American-populated neighborhood rocked by violence and civil rights protests. The film raises intimate discussions of race, faith and family, while also showing Castle's daily routine as a pastor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bPXBVy0mSV9kxM5lA4g4wGRfmA6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tesauro","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cousin Bobby","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
