Ever since his mother died, he shares his time between Porte de Clignancourt and Bastille, between a piercer job he is unhappy with and his fishmonger father, Hervé, who is trying to start a new life with a younger woman named Julia. Vincent is initially appalled by the woman, with whom his father has ‘betrayed’ his mother, but the more they get to know each other, the more he becomes intrigued by the beautiful and empathetic woman. Unlike his father, she shows interest in him, even attending one of his gigs. What starts out as a potential way of reconciling with his father soon implodes.","popularity":1.723,"poster_path":"/mi5YqA8DNBfmZMq0LesPaYshIuu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49934,"logo_path":"/ns14fiims2htw1kiEI9xCJFFlWO.png","name":"Kazak Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Taste of Ink","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":40}
