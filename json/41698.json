He has since sold millions ofrecords with his fusion of dance and sacred musics and is recognized as one of the originators of the now ubiquitous chillout genre. While this new release remains in much the same vein as before, this time there is somewhat more of a trance influence. Sound is available in Stereo, Dolby Digital Plus and DTS.","popularity":2.133,"poster_path":"/3wiP7zyBhcBN25qAgZ0QRQP1BqP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enigma: a Posteriori","video":true,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
