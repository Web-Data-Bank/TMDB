Y. A huge elephant stands at the top of the chutes and prepares for his trip. At his back is another elephant who starts his companion. The huge animal assumes a sitting position as he leaves the top and like a flash slides down the steep incline into the water. He strikes the water with a tremendous splash, remains under the water for a short time, enjoying his cool bath. It takes considerable coaxing on the part of his Arabian keeper to get him to come out of the water.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1904-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elephants Shooting the Chutes at Luna Park","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
