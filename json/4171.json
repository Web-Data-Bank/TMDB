Balthazar Balsan has everything to be happy about, but isn’t. Odette, awkwardly forty, with a delightful hairdresser son and a daughter bogged down in adolescence, spends her days behind the cosmetic’s counter in a department store and her nights sewing feathers on costumes for Parisian variety shows. She dreams of thanking Balthazar Balsan, her favorite author, to whom – she believes – she owes her optimism. The rich and charming Parisian writer then turns up in her life in an unexpected way.","popularity":4.372,"poster_path":"/dwpuTxb9JkBhPBqZs13iTpTjOAw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Renn Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":4600,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bel Ombre Films","origin_country":""},{"id":22377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antigone Cinéma","origin_country":""},{"id":22378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Etang","origin_country":""},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Odette Toulemonde","video":false,"vote_average":5.681,"vote_count":108}
