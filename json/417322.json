In the first part we follow the sinister and at times comical mechanics of how our heroes make a Revolution that will immediately eat them up. In the second part we will see them trying to find a role to play in the new State, as power is once again taken away from the people.","popularity":0.959,"poster_path":"/t4bnYWCYEoIx3LNlYZMse5qgB72.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DIY Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
