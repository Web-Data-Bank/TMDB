Her love story develops in the context of the onset of World War II: while the echoes of war get ever closer, the dispute between Germans and Anglos turns personal when Dolores is seduced by a neighbouring landowner of German descent, Octavio Brandt- he becomes an unexpected love, and from now on Dolores is torn between Octavio and Jack, as Argentina changes for ever. In a society dominated by men, Dolores must now also forge her unique destiny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vDJkvaoYNxUdwLUC4MYh0HpuI7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valkyria Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dolores","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4}
