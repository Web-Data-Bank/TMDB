People live along a narrow passageway. And there lives an old woman named Lee So-sun which means a small fairy. Ever since the death of her oldest son, Jeon Tae-il, she always lived sympathizing with the pain and sword-like life of her neighbors. Lee So-sun was the mother of all who waited for a 'humane world', standing straight in the world having no fear of anything. Young artists Baek Dae-hyun and Hong Seung-hee express the pain Jeon Tae-il and his mother Lee So-sun had to endure through their performances. What would be the meaning of Lee So-sun's life to these two artists who beautified all her pains in life? This work is about the final message left by the 'mother'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4evnbNYcJS7AR4tFMbQeGFauzb6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2012-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
