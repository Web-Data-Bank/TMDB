In this inspiring documentary, we meet with German politicians, scientists, farmers, social workers, activists and visionaries who say yes, and who all push forward for a global change in climate by changing the local power supply sources to renewable energy. Director Carl-A. Fechner is not ready to give up on our planet just yet, and POWER TO CHANGE is a welcome antidote to the pessimism that defines our era's visions of the future.","popularity":0.914,"poster_path":"/jgMvNiG8VgOKL8oYlLDai4hKBmP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131919,"logo_path":null,"name":"fechnerMEDIA: Produktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Power to Change","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
