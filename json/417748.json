Why did this happen ? Was it skill and leadership, the training, the quality and bravery of the soldiers, luck, a successful artillery barrage or poor German performance. Most probably a bit of all these factors. This is the story of the 7th Bedfords,  a Kitchener battalion in General Maxse's 18th Eastern Div. The Bedfords captured all their objectives, assisted the units on their flanks and established a new defensive line a mile beyond their objective.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Somme 1916: Pommiers Redoubt","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
