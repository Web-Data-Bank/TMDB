He is carrying a precious white cloth pod sewn up with red stitching. On his journey, he meets a trio of gem-mining island-dwellers who are keen to have the pod for themselves. As he makes his escape from them, he encounters a ferocious blue sea monster that intends to drag him down under the sand to its lair. The island-dwellers remain in hot pursuit, crowded into a teacup, rowing with a silver spoon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Seed in the Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
