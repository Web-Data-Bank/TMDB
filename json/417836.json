Charles Kent is an old man, who has spent all he owns on influencing a government appointment. His faithful black servant, Amber (Hal Wilson), cares for him as he waits to hear from the Capitol. No one there intends to do anything but make fun of him, even sending a false appointment, to his shame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zXpFFjlQ7fCjLmvHg6bWCmFjdNj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"His Official Appointment","title":"His Official Appointment","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
