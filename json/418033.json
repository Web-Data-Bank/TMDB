In the picturesque mountains of Val Lavizzara in Ticino, several individuals have come together to form a cooperative society and live such a life. There is a plethora of chores to be done on the farm: animals to feed, fields to plough and tree trunks to be chopped. As the year progresses, more and more issues surface dividing the younger and older residents: how much technology is acceptable? How much compromise is necessary and reasonable? Is the amount of work done in balance with the results gained?  Along with a poetic gaze, director Hans Haldimann also shows the sometimes extraordinarily complicated side to a ‘simple’ self-sufficient life. This may be far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but there are just as many problems to be faced.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nXInwa7XzUkoYVHD8eGuEcqisfo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Einfach Leben","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
