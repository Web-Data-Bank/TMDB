That's the question Red Numbers asks. The story revolves around a guy who, according to a Fengshui master, only has three lucky minutes in his miserable life. His fortune is wrapped up with a greedy family whose grandfather - dead or alive, nobody knows for sure, holds the key to the winning combination in the 4D lottery. Three minutes, four numbers, a lot of money - or maybe not.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7WYun2aeYCBVNqNw6buFpOaivG0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39261,"logo_path":null,"name":"Supernova Media","origin_country":""},{"id":95767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Project Peanut","origin_country":""},{"id":95768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silver Media Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2013-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Numbers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
