In a dialogue between generations, young people are responsible for elaborating the question, and School is the place that tries to come up with a technique for it. In turn, the elderly answer through their stories, which are basically the story of the town. And like the word –which is always a fiction– builds a reality, the film sustains its tone on that intermediate area in which a fictional setting provides the conditions for the pure documentary genre to mark the pace and reach out to people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rDoSW9HnBm5bCaipXT6xnbTWfVi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vientosur Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":19196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blackmaria","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2016-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Streets","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
