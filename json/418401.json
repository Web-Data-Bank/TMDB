The Matrix is a world within the world, a global consensus- hallucination, the representation of every byte of data in cyberspace . . .  Case had been the sharpest data-thief in the business, until vengeful former employers crippled his nervous system. But now a new and very mysterious employer recruits him for a last-chance run. The target: an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence orbiting Earth in service of the sinister Tessier-Ashpool business clan. With a dead man riding shotgun and Molly, mirror-eyed street-samurai, to watch his back, Case embarks on an adventure that ups the ante on an entire genre of fiction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2sxOpSGlS4YT7PaeLd6GO7cGgb6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Genre Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","title":"Neuromancer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
