Their mother left for Yeonbyeon three months ago, promising to return with their father, and they have heard no news from her since. Every day, Myung-hee and Myung-ho go to the shipping port or airport hoping for their parents' return. Tired from waiting one day, Myung-hee meets Yong-kyu, a young man high from sniffing glue. Beyond a tough and violent exterior, Myung-hee finds a young man's heartwarming inner-self, and she expects Yong-kyu to take the place of her parents. But even Yong-kyu leaves her and life steadily deteriorates. Hoping for help, Myung-hee goes to a familiar Korean-Chinese woman, arriving in time to find immigration officials taking the woman away. They are now truly alone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pgQK2fwUWgVsuG9HdgiuACRUuwr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74216,"logo_path":"/gNBRUzI4CI9cKfNDsR9KOdlkEj6.png","name":"Busan Film Commission","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
