They talk about adolescence, bras, commercial images of women's figures, having implants or, in one case, a breast reduction, health problems with silicone, doctors' exams (\"I think you have a throat infection, let me examine your breasts\"), breasts as power tools and as objects of pleasure, cancer, living with mastectomies, and the effects of time and gravity.

The women (and the girls) are humorous, straightforward, reflective, and good-natured about their bodies and their selves","popularity":0.838,"poster_path":"/weEv1pjjqMg9ZKYIDRlTBIRSmyp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breasts: A Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":6}
