Cesar proposes that Iker film the preparation and execution of a revenge killing. Iker accepts with the goal of filming the preparation, but of stopping the crime before it actually takes place. Iker investigates the case of the murdered youth and the strange circumstances surrounding it. Meanwhile Cesar fine tunes his plan to manipulate the penal code to eliminate or at least minimize any punishment for the crime he is planning, so as to show how justice is an illusion. As he designs the plan to avenge himself on Fabian Arias, the alleged killer of his son, he uses the penal code and his plans for a legal defense to decide the form, timing and manner in which he will carry out his version of Justice.","popularity":0.77,"poster_path":"/aqpCEimQYlqEg6zvPLCdHehLnts.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ad hoc Studios","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wrath","video":false,"vote_average":3.917,"vote_count":12}
