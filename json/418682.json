Millions of people have journeyed to Medjugorje to see for themselves, and nearly all describe a sense of peace they've never felt before. Could it be real? These seven strangers investigate the truth: a young mother with stage 4 cancer, an atheist from England, a man suffering from ALS, a heroin addict and former felon, an atheist police officer, a father of nine who lost his wife to cancer, and a woman questioning her faith. Will their climb up Apparition Hill lead them to a modern-day miracle or a spectacular hoax?","popularity":0.807,"poster_path":"/u0zPtAhzqg6SpZCb8YXUtAXtGyq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apparition Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
