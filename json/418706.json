The tangled legacy of European colonialism in Africa is evoked through images of women practicing hair braiding on discarded white baby dolls from the West. The film unfolds through a series of vignettes, set against a child's story of migrating from Ghana to the United States. The film uncovers the meaning behind the Akan term of endearment, me broni ba, which means “my white baby.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s4YcBEmDl3K6kkkq3G0mPTpqhFj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53633,"logo_path":null,"name":"Obibini Pictures","origin_country":"GH"},{"id":38413,"logo_path":"/qW9eadVJfNRx9jdZkuDxWR25RW6.png","name":"CalArts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GH","name":"Ghana"}],"release_date":"2009-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Akan","iso_639_1":"ak","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My White Baby","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
