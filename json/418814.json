One of Eugene Buck’s motivations for making the film may have been his rough cross-examination during his kidnappers’ first trials, in October 1913, when defense attorneys cast him as a confused and unreliable witness against idealistic freedom fighters.  On film he could reproduce the pursuit, the shootouts, his kidnapping, and his friend’s murder just as he had testified.  Reenacting the crime on film may have been the best revenge—and a way to honor the sacrifice of Deputy Ortiz, a twenty-year police veteran and, for the era, a rare Mexican American lawman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f4yMZVEZ8otMjWhmhyHjpGJpgbP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90946,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elk Photoplays Inc","origin_country":""},{"id":90947,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buckhorn Film Co","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ammunition Smuggling on the Mexican Border: Incidents of the Mexican Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
