The August 23rd show features never-before-released acoustic material and showcases the band’s intimately cohesive, high-spirited live delivery of their music. Highlights of Live Trax 32 include the tour's acoustic debut of One Sweet World and the first live release of If Only. Rhyme and Reason with Stefan on stand-up bass and Jeff Coffin on flute and the funky, infectious groove of Recently are also noteworthy. Electric set stand-outs include the set opening #41 followed by When the World Ends and Rooftop and an explosive Grey Street which brought the energy of an encore during mid-show. The Lovely Ladies contributed in large part to the Berkeley magic, joining the band for tremendous vocals on Everyday, You and Me and Burning Down the House. The show-closing Rapunzel was a nice surprise ending to a stellar evening with the band.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4UDGHyUa9WSzJrxmSo4Yzf58fLQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dave Matthews Band - Live Trax 32","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
