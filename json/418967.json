These elements and more emerge and re-emerge like musical motifs, continuously and meticulously altered through processes like bleaching, staining, and multiple print generation, dramatically extracting the formal particularities of the Kodachrome reversal print.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k4r9Ob8HLdiGbhDgRPcO8ffSK9s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Heart","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
