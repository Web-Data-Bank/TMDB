A\r former CIA source recounts his disappearance through shredded classified documents that\r were painstakingly reassembled by radical fundamentalist students in Iran in 1979 following\r the takeover of the U.S embassy. A CIA film—recorded in 1974 but unacknowledged until\r 1992—documents the burial at sea of six Soviet sailors, in a ceremony which collapses Cold\r War antagonisms in a moment of death and honor. A single photograph pertaining to a\r publicly acknowledged but top secret U.S. missile strike in Yemen in 2002 is the source of a\r reflection on the role of images in the dynamic of knowing and not knowing.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It’s Not My Memory of It: Three Recollected Documents","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
