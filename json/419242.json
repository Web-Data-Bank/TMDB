But Yuk's hopes are dashed on finding his dad has a new family and considers him a burden. Alone and homeless, Yuk is taken in by Auntie Fen, a middle-aged recluse who leads a solitary existence. At first, their different habits and personalities lead to numerous squabbles, intensified by Yuk's self-centeredness and Fen's odd temperament. As time goes on, Yuk learns Fen is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. The discovery unexpectedly serves as a catalyst for the young man's growth as a caring friend. For the first time in her life, Fen feels truly blessed. But it is a situation rife with irony due to the nature of her disease and the accelerating elusiveness of feelings and memories.","popularity":0.962,"poster_path":"/f8o7OTPd2CvQRtbVHpI74XOdNYT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2726,"logo_path":null,"name":"JCE Movies","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2016-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":11}
