Then, a second flash. And that's the last thing anyone on Earth can remember. 11 months later, it's not post- apocalyptic; it's apocalyptic as Earth has been sucked through a wormhole, literally ripping our planet from the inside out. With bizarre disasters and civilization collapsing, our heroes must find a way to survive and get to \"safe ground\" before it's too late.","popularity":5.949,"poster_path":"/PdO6DOQktCGtPeZRrtOZhtvjWf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10399,"logo_path":null,"name":"CineTel Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Earthtastrophe","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":39}
