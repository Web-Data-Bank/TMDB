We see a master in action in exclusive footage at the various stages off his process--conceptualizing, sketching, and even deciding the color of the stones to be used in the galleries of the Louvre Abu Dhabi. This is a meditative and rare portrait of one of the giants of contemporary architecture and design.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Altimeter Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean Nouvel: Reflections","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
