The film was shot in real locations using only available light. The viewer is both a voyeur - watching the characters in intimate situations that are not meant to be seen - and an active participant - imagining what the characters are going through and making connections between them that may or may not be real.","popularity":2.199,"poster_path":"/uhIiY3h2IRaFAGXJI4IQaVXxD3e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Available Light","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
