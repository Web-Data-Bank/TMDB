Porthos, bored with riches and wanting a title, signs on, but Aramis, an abbé, and Athos, a brawler raising an intellectual son, assist Beaufort in secret. When they fail to halt Beaufort's escape from prison, the musketeers are expendable, and Mazarin sends them to London to rescue Charles I. They are also pursued by Justine, the avenging daughter of Milady de Winter, their enemy 20 years ago. They must escape England, avoid Justine, serve the Queen, and secure Beauford's political reforms.","popularity":8.538,"poster_path":"/5KP0TNYT2yH1yo7sfV5hQWQ4qWA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1405,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fildebroc","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":14498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné 5","origin_country":""},{"id":84954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofica Sofinergie","origin_country":""},{"id":29655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Investimage","origin_country":""},{"id":8131,"logo_path":null,"name":"Timothy Burrill Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":28040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iberoamericana Films Produccion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of the Musketeers","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":123}
