The Park Slope Food Coop: a cooperative supermarket where all 16,000 members work 3 hours per months to earn the right to buy the best food in New York at incredibly low prices. The success of this cooperative is a bad new for capitalism and aggro-alimentary business, and an opportunity to change the food production and distribution systems. We will see what has become of the Park Slope Food Coop, now a well-rooted institution in the heart of Brooklyn: the way it functions, its hundreds of rules, the diversity and eccentricity of its members. We'll see how the culture that has been created at the coop gives its members daily visceral lessons in democracy, how this could represent a potential change in mentality for Americans faced with increasingly difficult economic times.","popularity":0.794,"poster_path":"/ufKrtoJYcmDXAAwNxJiFnCfze2Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72654,"logo_path":"/qAGfpZE53RKgPWyiWYnIUdzpPrb.png","name":"Lardux films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Food Coop","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":4}
