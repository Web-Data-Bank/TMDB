But, 20 years on from his Baptist upbringing, Beckford is no longer so sure that 'the good book' is the pure, unadulterated word of God untouched by human hand.  For Beckford, who wrote the Bible matters more today than perhaps at any other moment in living memory.  His journey takes him from Birmingham to the West Bank, from Jerusalem to Turkey, and from Rome to Bible Belt America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hIjAs1oJ7XNsw8ZskYknQh834Pk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Wrote the Bible?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
