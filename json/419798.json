Taking her young daughter with her, Nur hurries back to her father's world to see, and reconcile with her mother before it is too late. While the universal theme of mother-daughter relationships lies at the centre of the film, this is underpinned by an allusive subtext of incest, one of most common but least addressed social problems in Turkey. The individual stories of the family members combine with a sense of hope fuelled by tragedy to paint a portrait of the socially disconnected.","popularity":0.716,"poster_path":"/5fTmyQln5vzf0WER0lkN6TR092H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlanta Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2016-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Visitor","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
