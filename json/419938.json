We find a present-day couple that has stumbled onto a statue of Venus. They say magic words they once heard and then, the Gods showed them what Olympus was really about!  This is the only Csilla Kalnay video. Adult stars also making their debut in this video: Eniko Wrabel.  As Greek gods go about the most pleasurable thing in the Olympus (Jove does Hebe, and Mars does Venus - much to the dismay of Vulcanus), a couple err through a medieval cloister and - after a brief and passionate gust of love-making - stumble upon the statue of Venus: the very statue by the hands of the immortal sculptor Pygmalion, who had made the Goddess come to life!! The girl (Kelly Trump) does not believe in fairy tales and walks off. As the guy awakens the statue using a complex ancient Greek incantation (which he conveniently knows by heart), he is 'visited' by the Goddess and then abducted to Olympus.","popularity":1.165,"poster_path":"/suG2p4dkSd24Dy4akpODvrVWar7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15032,"logo_path":null,"name":"In-X-Cess","origin_country":""},{"id":19559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moonlight Home Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":116993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tripolis Finances Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olympus: Refuge of Gods","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":3}
