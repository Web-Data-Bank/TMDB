It is only the second film made by Robert Gardner and tries to show in cinematic language how this man looked at the world; Mark Tobey himself both performs and is observed. A unique film in the Gardner ouvre, the film not only presents an experimental portrait of Tobey but serves as a window into the American art, avant garde film and poetic movements of this period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3CqoUXw8HxNdeFAQev7vRKnekhD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mark Tobey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
