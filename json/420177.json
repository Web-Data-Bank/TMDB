The singing of songs has come to articulate creative forms and political structures that steered the Kashipur resistance movement from subalternity, through solidarity and into dissolution. The film interweaves the efforts to record song, farming, village life and a political meeting to improvise a junction between voice, music, silence, sound and noise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
