The protagonists give their accounts of the unsurmounted past, the precarious present and their tentative steps into the future. The film thus paints a complex image of the mental state of the people in this complicated country.","popularity":0.785,"poster_path":"/yS3fxT4RRRjVuJ3vcABi13nZYqz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156854,"logo_path":null,"name":"go between films GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":74160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Recycled TV","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2014-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on three different places, the film portrays the infractions to which people living in modern day China are subjected due to rapid developments.","title":"Watermarks - Three Letters from China","video":false,"vote_average":7.75,"vote_count":4}
