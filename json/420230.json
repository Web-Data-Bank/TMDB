In a wonderful mix of fiction, archival footage, processed interviews and soap opera drama, the film tells the story of Claudia Marin, a middle-class, light-skinned, lesbian Puerto Rican photographer / videographer who is attempting to construct a sense of community in the US. Confronting the simultaneity of both her privilege and her oppression, this experimental narrative becomes a meditation on class, race, and sexuality as shifting differences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4uwNFbf7kDsxIBShLLYJvYjQ256.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82197,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hipsic Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"1994-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brincando el charco: Portrait of a Puerto Rican","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
