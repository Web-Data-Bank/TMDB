Through a combination of silence, the everyday gestures of this woman and the films that are projected from her living room, comes a film built like a day in Sena’s life. Through the films that Sena projects, we are taken on a journey in both collective and personal memory. The film offers a portrait of intimacy crossed with a history witnessed by cinema; a history which Sena has conserved.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i7ngDQ0tNdiaRwMIbTvDC0QEOcm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8681,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.R.I.M.
