The only flaw with the DVD is it's too short--many of Thompson's shows can go well over the two hour mark and I suspect that many songs are missing from this terrific show.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kHpp7qzJtuhx21swCQb8HyyONwe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Thompson Band: Live in Providence","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
