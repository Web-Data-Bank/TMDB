Beethoven thought she was a bad influence on the boy. Sadly, the nephew isn't receptive to Beethoven's \"overtures\", and resents his boorish uncle's efforts on his behalf. The nephew is a complete nonentity, lacking in both interest and talent. He seems to wish only to be left alone.","popularity":1.064,"poster_path":"/221DluFbtlvI3Fv21ddttixIs5z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven's Nephew","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
