While her husband Mak is away, Nak goes into labor and dies in their country home. At the funeral, a black cat jumps on the coffin, it breaks and Nak miraculously comes back to life. During the day she appears normal but at night she transforms into a rotten corpse. The ghostly wife serves her husband rotten, wormy food and eventually goes on a rampage. There's also comic relief. This is a remake of movie shot in 1973 under the same title.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mae Nak Rampage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
