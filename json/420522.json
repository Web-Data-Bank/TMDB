This woman loses her own name and is called Njai, which means a foreigner's concubine, and realizes that she is living in a kind of prison, while she deals with loads of visitors to her residence. Director Garin Nugroho shows in a distinctive way how much effort a woman, deserted both by the colonial country's law and the colonized country's traditional culture, puts in to retain her dignity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fBIwuLMglieH2WYutAKtx3ikaFO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Garin Nugroho Workshop","origin_country":""},{"id":101625,"logo_path":null,"name":"Treewater Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":110784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Super 8mm Studio","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2016-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Javanese","iso_639_1":"jv","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nyai: A Woman from Java","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
