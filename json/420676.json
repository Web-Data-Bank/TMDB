Partly inspired by Joseph Conrad’s modernist literary masterpiece Heart of Darkness, the visceral and moving work was filmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo using 16mm colour infra-red film, which captures otherwise invisible parts of the spectrum. The resulting imagery in Mosse’s work is hallucinatory and dream-like with the usual greens of jungle and forest replaced by shimmering violet. The Enclave depicts a complicated, strife-ridden place in a way that reflects its complexity, using a strategy of beauty and transfixion to combat the wider invisibility of a conflict that has claimed so many.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wJMBa2XHuvEhqVz5Qen6FmmYJqp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2013-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Enclave","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
