Passive and submissive roles are tackled and tugged in gay graffiti tale VANDALS and Icelandic grapple-fest WRESTLING, while POSTMORTEM, MY NAME IS LOVE, and Iris Prize-winner STEAM look at promising encounters that turn awry.  Rounding out the collection are HEIKO, an alternative ode to foot fetishes, BREATH where 12-year-old Erik swims out to sea to make a daring move on his best friend's father, and the crème de la crème from this collection TREVOR, which won multiple prestigious awards from Sundance, Berlinale, and even The Academy Awards (Oscar) for Best Short Film.","popularity":2.724,"poster_path":"/95kpVAzezgQTSvIO0yj16T7q4RP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peccadillo Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boys On Film 4: Protect Me From What I Want","video":true,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":5}
