Through the evocation of illusory spaces, real places, interventions of those who were his friends and knew him, we proceed by flashes and suggestions to the staging of an artistic parable, nourished by tumultuous love, contempt for life, alcohol and genius, which has left an indelible mark in the history of songwriting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1kfF3WU3nO99QwoouF6CdS56SaL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adius, Piero Ciampi e altre storie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
