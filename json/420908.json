Since taking office in 2008, on the promise of hope and change, president Barak Obama has launched an aggressive assault on America's liberty.  He has armed America's enemies, violating his oath of office, by sending money and weapons of war to insurgents in Syria led by Al-Qaeda terrorists.  He has violated federal law by overseeing a cover-up surrounding attorney general Eric Holder's operation \"Fast and Furious\", in the running of guns to Mexican drug cartels.  He has lied to the American people by overseeing a cover-up of the September 11 Benghazi terror attack in Libya which led directly to the deaths of four American citizens.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82305,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMTV Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obama's Real Reason He Wants Your Guns","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
