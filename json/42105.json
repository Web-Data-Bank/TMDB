Both were music entities. Robert Schumann turns out to have been a second tier composer, if that, never rising to the heights of a Beethoven or Mozart. In contrast, Clara Wieck was a master technician in the playing of the piano, a composer (probably not at Schumann's level), and was a child prodigy.","popularity":1.142,"poster_path":"/fEcRMXvTJds9LPR5vHe2kHdTetH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":34442,"logo_path":"/d69qhxKbqrQRq9XIAP70R0GCzve.png","name":"Allianz Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":34443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berliner Filmförderung","origin_country":""},{"id":13288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Schamoni Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":34444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schweizer Fernsehen (FS)","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spring Symphony","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7}
