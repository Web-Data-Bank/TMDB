He liked the images from the dark movie theater, only partly lit by the film, so much that he did the same at later screenings, presented between Portugal and the United States, in order to weave these images into a fabric of places and times – into a vision of cinema gliding over continents through the light of the projector.What’s celebrated here is a practice that has to be defended for its inherent democratic spirit. In CINÉMA VÉRITÉ, Wyborny has now condensed this cinematic utopia into trailer length, to manifesto density. Cinema, as Wyborny understands it and as the Viennale practices it, is a constant departure into reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":62009,"logo_path":"/eQDXDIHyv7ATyCx7CJUZ7HDFRSB.png","name":"Viennale","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2016-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinéma Vérité","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
