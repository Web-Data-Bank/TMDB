The brutal war is mutilating both the girls' bodies and their souls.  Location: military hospital. It is just a backdrop to which the character rattles, the intrigue, the human relationships. The pathos of the tape conveys the idea that a woman is and remains a woman in all circumstances and situations. During the tumultuous years of war, they were also overwhelmed by true love, mutual understanding, trust and tenderness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4bzgGayie7Zn9ZvlHQt5vow8pha.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82801,"logo_path":"/8h6Ugz5S1DiX7kaeg19eQKXsS4q.png","name":"Rīgas kinostudija","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1989-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmen Horrendum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
