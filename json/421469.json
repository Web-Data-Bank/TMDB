Like the film, this projection-performance presents the layers of reality and fantasy. Apichatpong fuses his memories with the actors’ and fictionalises the narrative. Here the people takes refuge in dreams while their land is on a brink of collapse, echoing Thailand’s present state of military dictatorship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8BxIXUmgOKVH9af7Tnj4QYy0fq4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fever Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
