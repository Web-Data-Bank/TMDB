More than eight years later, she was at his side when he died. During this entire time, she only entered his room when he rang for her, sleeping from 9 AM to 3 PM to wait during the night while he wrote. Marcel uses her as more than a servant: she is his muse, telling stories of her childhood to stir his remembrance of things past; she's in cahoots with him as he manipulates those he wants to draw on for his writing; she listens appalled to his descriptions of the underside of Paris. Hers is a life of love and sweet devotion as he races time to finish his work before death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6hkBOi9ZQGIjIwf2gxNn1NURkZC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pelemele Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Céleste","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
