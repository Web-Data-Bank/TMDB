Beginning in the late 1960s, Don fondly recalls a time of multiracial harmony as youngsters bonded over a love of ska, reggae and smart clothes as white working-class kids were attracted to Jamaican culture and adopted its music and fashions. But when far-right politics targeted skinheads in the 1970s and 1980s, an ugly intolerance emerged, and Don reveals how the once-harmonious subgroup has since struggled to shake this stigma.","popularity":1.025,"poster_path":"/igM1fS4SQw5nP4fjHmmvJA1ye68.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75645,"logo_path":null,"name":"7 Wonder Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Skinhead","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
