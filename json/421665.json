While some are content to live an ordinary life, others cannot accept the notion of death and will do anything to prevent their demise. Retired Lt. Arland Frye is a man who has had terrifying experiences and seen life changing horrors that led him on a dark journey into the unknown. Experimenting with Brujo magic and the occult, Lt.
