The pupils pay their own teachers and decide what they want to learn. No headmaster, no hierarchy, and no pressure. But they still only have two years to prepare for the final test administered and required by the government. A tribute to curiosity, Berlin Rebel High School is a film about the true meaning of learning.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/u8Gc18eTQ8bXSN0i8ngM82o6ZVC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1235,"logo_path":"/lrS9d6tT20guiyUb279dLkmNwm0.png","name":"Neue Visionen","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin Rebel High School","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
