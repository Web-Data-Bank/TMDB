Judith Myers and her best friend D'arcy Mims are planning a Halloween night camp-out at The Myers House with their friends. Judith is trying to forget the growing tensions in her family and wants to immerse herself in a carefree celebration, but her reclusive brother's presence casts an ominous shadow over their cheerful preparations. This short film breaths life into an often overlooked character from John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN - Judith Myers may have only had a short appearance in the classic film, but she nevertheless played a crucial role in the forming of the Michael Myers story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Night She Stayed Home","title":"Judith: The Night She Stayed Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
