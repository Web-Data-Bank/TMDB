There's some resistance and the local population calls up a shaman who announces he will be a shaman for a thousand years. Yes, he's evil. So we're off to more wackiness with wizards, ghosts, zombies, and a few of those female ogres/ghouls. There are a few gut-munching scenes. It all ends up in a magical war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p7GkipKRsyG3oH9rfo6RllXnm41.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pechpanna Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"1991-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost War","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
