This period ends with a ten-day war, when the identity turns from peacefulness, modesty and diligence into courage and a fighting spirit. The film documents the changes in Slovenia and its inhabitants, which have in recent years brought us to a completely different understanding of national identity, different from the one which was true in Slovenia as well as abroad twenty years ago.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":37020,"logo_path":"/o6XZOvru5b5yuDQ6tc7vP69MBwi.png","name":"Sever \u0026 Sever","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2013-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Once Was a Land of Hard-working People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
