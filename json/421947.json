Starting the film as a foreign student in 1984, Kazimi begins to unravel the hidden history of the land that he has chosen as his home.  At one level, Shooting Indians is a portrait of Jeffrey Thomas, an Iroquois photographer. The film explores the influences on his life which led him to his career. It was the work of an American photographer from the turn of the century, Edward Curtis, which forced Thomas to closely examine how Indigenous peoples had been photographed in the past. Thomas views Curtis’ monumental work as a “mountain which must be crossed.”  On another level is the irony of an Indian from India making a film on a North American Indian and this is woven throughout the fabric of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shooting Indians: A Journey with Jeffrey Thomas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
