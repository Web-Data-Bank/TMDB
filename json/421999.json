The images, sounds and structure are sometimes somewhat abstract while preserving a strong grounding in representation.\" â€“Leighton Pierce","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5VWNktkhR2mbK6bD7Z2Z5wC9Bqy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Principles of Harmonic Motion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
