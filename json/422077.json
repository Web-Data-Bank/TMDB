Besides the requirement of shooting at the exhibition site of part two of the same project by Hélène Richol, I was free to respond to the concept as I felt it; and according to my usual way of working, I played with materiality of the original footage, manipulating it to its point of no return. By the same time I was also to turn over the meaning of the word, the irreversible became reversible through the flipping of the emulsion right to left, top to bottom, front to back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'irréversible chapître d'un roman 3 dimensionnel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
