A catfight with Marie-Claude Viollet also ends up in hot lesbian action, with M-C playing her usual role as supporting character, such as in Annonces spéciales pour couples vicieux (also directed by Alain Payet, with almost the same cast), Les Délices de l'adultère and Couple cherche esclave sexuel, when she appears in the second part of the film to participate in orgy scenes. Part of the final orgy has also been used in Sophie aime les sucettes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ijaRufc2cVFKhkH8vVmLxvCXNIz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julie par-devant par-derrière","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
