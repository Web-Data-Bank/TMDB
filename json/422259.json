They go out as women at night, but live as men during the day, take hormones, and dream of “going for a change.” Subjected to a six-month psychological project, and cross-examined by dubious “experts” all four women are incredibly captivating subjects—whether being interrogated or partying at the ball.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ftopSO88R12jrAcUPgaWg2NZFnF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158490,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southeastern Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queens At Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
