A slapstick comedy sequence, featuring low-rent comics Miller &amp; Leeds, involves a judge, a district attorney and some female defendants of less-than-sterling character. Lonnie Young dances a strip and the comics return with a routine in which one of them is cheated out of his money. Romo the Clown does some unfunny stuff mixed in with the dancing of Rusty Lane, Dora Lee, Micky Miles, Lynn Miller and Lorna Rhodes and a song by Joy Cheryl, and Vicers ends it all as a crackpot doctor examining one of the strippers in a burlesque-skit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phoenix Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Free Show at the Sideshow!","title":"Sideshow Burlesque","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
