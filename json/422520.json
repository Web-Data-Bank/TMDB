Cowboy and Indian are always up to some harebrained scheme, with Horse left to clean up the mess. In Christmas Panic, their out-of-control antics lead Horse to call Santa and cancel the presents. But the boys figure they can still save Christmasâ€¦ if they break into their neighbor's house to steal his yule log! In Back to School Panic, a class assignment yields a special prize, but only Pig knows the answer. Cowboy and Indian use a special shrinking potion to sneak into Pig's brain, where they discover a sodium-packed world of pig cops riding in bacon cars and sausage cycles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dE9SDP5G0rFcQ2qbR0JU3oGkYex.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32853,"logo_path":"/y1CUzdA8WOdKzikxTYL4xqCDlqF.png","name":"GKIDS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2016-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Town Called Panic: Double Fun","video":true,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3}
