A street, passers-by, a sunset, all accompanied by electronic humming: Current Shot 01 consists of a single 15-min shot [...] But the apparent stillness of the shot turns out to be deceptive: while no movement can be seen, the figures' shadows have changed, and a third suddenly leaves the cluster it formed with the other two. As a results of the extreme slow motion, this slight movement can only be recognised after the fact. Like a picture puzzle where you have to look for the differences, the detail oscillates between animated photography, film still and tableau vivant.\r ~ Alexandra Seibel","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Current Shot 01","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
