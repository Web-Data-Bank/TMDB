Literary anecdotes abound, as does petty bickering. The masks they’ve carefully crafted are suddenly torn away, exposing their tainted humanity. Desires, jealousies and secrets are laid bare during 90 minutes on the terrace, culminating in a shocking and not exactly happy ending.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Terrace","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
