Following the sudden death of their friend Shep, Kristopher and Ryan quickly grow less attached to reality. As they wander the southern landscape of Louisiana, they descend into a state devoid of hope and order; a place where life and death are one and the same; a land where we are all doomed. The aesthetic artifacts of the video tapes and the vernacular wanderings caught on them present a rip-it-up-and-start-again style montage of life caught in the vise of western culture at the dead end of of the first world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FTW","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
