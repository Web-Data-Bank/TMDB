And a terrifying and mysterious horned creature. And a mute girl locked up in the attic. From this familiar but decent premise, director Lu Shiyu makes his film an endless – though only 80 minutes long – series of shrieky nightmare sequences (the main character wakes up with a jolt roughly once every two minutes), ham-fisted flashbacks and trite stalking scenes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ei3M8AaNgoyHfQ36ibIW4ExZMRQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horrible Mansion in Wild Village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
