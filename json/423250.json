He comes in contact with Sub-Inspector Gokhale (Om Puri), who feels sorry for him, and not only offers to find his brother, but also employment at an Irani Restaurant. Bhaskar does find his brother - in the morgue - but decides not to tell his mother as this may break her heart. He decides to stay on in Bombay and undergoes training to become a police officer. A short time later he is also a Sub-Inspector working closely with Gokhale. He is wounded in an encounter, and his mother comes to look after, and gets him to marry Aditi (Nandita Das) from the same village, which Bhaskar does so.","popularity":0.889,"poster_path":"/rIy7dHprP2CDgmCmUg51gMEY92Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Interlingua","iso_639_1":"ia","name":""},{"english_name":"Interlingue","iso_639_1":"ie","name":""},{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""},{"english_name":"Inupiaq","iso_639_1":"ik","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life on the Edge","title":"Kagaar","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
