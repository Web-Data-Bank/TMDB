Officers Colin McCoy and Dan Foley expect this week to be business as usual, but are caught off-guard when they're suddenly thrust into a storm of conspiracy and corruption, all surrounding a series of attacks by a mysterious flasher. Over the course of the week, they face apathetic theatre students, singing buffoons, office politics, a psychic palm-reader, and a drug-crazed lunatic who launch them into the most high-profile case of their careers. Campus Police is a film in the spirit of the zany, screwball comedies of yesteryear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Campus Police","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
