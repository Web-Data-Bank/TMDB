Twenty years later, Aleksey discovers that his condition is degenerative and that he will soon lose the ability to walk. Aleksey sets out to choreograph a ballet he envisaged long before but never staged for fear of failure. “What will I leave behind after I am gone?” is a question Aleksey feels he must contend with. However, returning to the world of ballet will not be easy for a man who has made so many enemies over the course of his life.","popularity":1.516,"poster_path":"/aoH46XC3aq86D3oO8kTMpD8nvG7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Production Value WorldWide","origin_country":""},{"id":3419,"logo_path":"/byrxE2pJD9JLyBCIzyK0pYVanyG.png","name":"Central Partnership","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After You're Gone","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":11}
