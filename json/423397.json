THE ONTOLOGICAL COWBOY documents Foreman’s invocation of the \"manifest destiny\" of the avant-garde theater, King Cowboy Rufus strolling down off San Juan Hill with a sigh, waving his handkerchief. Foreman plays himself, and the cast pantomimes his preoccupations. If \"the cast and crew suffer alike,\" it’s all for a good cause: the violent rebirth of the American theater, with Foreman as its midwife.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ontological Cowboy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
