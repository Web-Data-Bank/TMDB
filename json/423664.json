Its subtitle refers to a 1915 song composed by Ralph Chaplin as an anthem for unionized workers. The film itself is the cinematic version of that anthem, as it allows us a comprehensive understanding of the need for these early labor unions, and the enormous sacrifices of its members to ensure fairness, safety, and equality in the workplace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q9zr0Z63zPkaNrew8C1HtpLyif0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7075,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metanoia Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plutocracy II: Solidarity Forever","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
