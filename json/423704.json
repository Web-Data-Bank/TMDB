I step inside and move through a corridor of electrically charged wires, constantly experiencing painful shocks and sinking to the floor. But I accept the challenge and, in a somewhat pathological increase in willpower, I press my head against the wires again and again. Society is a closed, structured space, which regulates all human energy through painful barriers. Only through an effort of will to overcome the pain (which is at the core of society) is one able to achieve a state of free expression.” – VALIE EXPORT","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ozo6JSQHqNPlLEOiIcpZlvuAiB6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hyperbulie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
