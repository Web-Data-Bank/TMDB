Nature is always a construction, whether in dynamic processes, dis-analog systems or physical, technical signals. 'Nature' formulates the organizational forms of representational strategies - symbolic structures, both in reality and in fiction. Where are the borders, the interfaces, the de-bordering and the analogies for ‘natural’ nature and ‘technical’ nature? These considerations provided the basis for the video.” – VALIE EXPORT","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cDqsOA7NKZzA0FJQqZ7uzMpCIX8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Duality of Nature","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
