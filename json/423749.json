Details from the Greek island of Hydra, a figure, a study in light and place and the act of creation.  The first half of the film explores delicate nuances of lighting, colour and depth as Beavers shoots the face of a young man in various locales on the Greek island of Hydra, using a variety of customized masks and filters. The manâ€™s face remains constant throughout, surrounded by iconic elements in the landscape, like a pulsating Renaissance portrait. Still Light brings to mind any number of structuralist binarisms: youth and age, creation and criticism, action and reflection, living landscape and mummified text.\r (Ed Halter, New York Press).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bLTKFzeBxtLviW3lc1k8Zv1N3WD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Light","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
