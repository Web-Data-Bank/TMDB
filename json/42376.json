In response to the environmental decline, the Earth Star Voyager is created as an experimental space ship that sends the brightest young crewmen and women on a quest to find a new planet that human beings can colonize. Along the way, they find the long lost Jacob 'Jake' Brown, find a world with hostile aliens, and learn that the star craft's top secret purpose was not just a peaceful space exploration mission, but also potentially the critical piece of a super weapon.","popularity":2.385,"poster_path":"/eYygCFsecZW9NMxM0ZbT7fsl4gg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Earth Star Voyager","video":false,"vote_average":6.25,"vote_count":4}
