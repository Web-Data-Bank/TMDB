Three years later, Kohji is working the streets as a hustler, still yearning for a way to earn his estranged father's approval to continue his borderline incestuous relationship. Hiroko sees a way back to her brother's arms when Sando's shady colleague Marc Tanner (François Trottier) absconds to Canada with gambling funds destined for the big boss. Presumably with her father's permission, she calls Kohji and tells him to hurry to Montréal, recover the money and kill Tanner.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/d0di84zzD6n2B3TrDkOGoWpbxrQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films à Un Dollar","origin_country":""},{"id":16092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aviva Communications","origin_country":""},{"id":20255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Isle","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passenger","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
