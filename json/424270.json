The brothers chose Louis Malle's wild, hallucinogenic BLACK MOON (1975), itself a tripped-out reimagining of \"Alice in Wonderland.\" Shot in the woods near their Austin homes, BLACK SOMETHING captures Malle's blending of idyllic pastoral imagery with nightmarish fantasy, distilling it into a skin-crawlingly unsettling three-minute short.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Something","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
