The interviews all take place in a studio, where the goal was to place the interviewees in a sort of job interview situation. The interviewees have many different nationalities and backgrounds and were subjected to a litany of questions covering the themes of work, art, satisfaction, wishes, creativity, study and their personal life situations. The goal was not to build a personal profile of each individual, but rather to present a forum to discuss each of the questions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Artists","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
