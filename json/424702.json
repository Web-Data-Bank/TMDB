The randy Swede soon tires of Gustav s dull dissertations on Polish heroes and suggests looking for female companionship, but the task proves beyond the skills of the shy academic. Eventually, Gustav calls Isa, an old girlfriend from his distant past who was writing a dissertation on the mating habits of geese the last time they spoke. While Isa is not what the Swede had in mind, Gustav sees his old flame through the rose-colored glasses of time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fKrj2azggmOXsDNHDyih8cxeoJP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Close-Up Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1995-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"List of Lovers","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":4}
