Despite her intentions to stay alone, however, Naomi quickly makes two unexpected connections- one with a musically gifted Ultra-Orthodox young boy who lives in her building and the other, with Fabrizio, a charismatic Italian monk and organist. While these relationships allow Naomi to reconnect with her love of music and sense of meaning, they also make her a target in her new community. Faced with escalating isolation and violence, Naomi must learn to use music as a bridge to overcome towering religious barriers.","popularity":0.776,"poster_path":"/1zFMsT8Z7pzqdfTjuu8tw8NXUQ5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39719,"logo_path":"/fwymnjt9qfiUVi2m820nNbJLV1M.png","name":"Green Productions","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Quiet Heart","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
