In community-supported wheelchair basketball programs across the country, players push each other physically, mentally and emotionally in order to succeed against the odds, struggling with the challenges of dedicating oneself to a sport that does not garner the recognition or resources granted to other professional athletic organizationsâ€”wheelchair basketball is all too often regarded as a sort of charity instead of the riveting competitive sport that it is. The Miami Heat Wheels are ready for their second shot at winning the nationals, but lack of funds and personal problems threaten to put an end to the dream before the season reaches its tension-riddled conclusion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fkePS01jK38ySdn552WDHc5rllM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rebound","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
