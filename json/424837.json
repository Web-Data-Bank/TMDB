Cornell wrote future TOTD songs \"Say Hello 2 Heaven\" and \"Reach Down\" to help process his grief, but the songs didn't have any destination, he says. \"I was compelled to write them and there they were â€“ written in a vacuum as a tribute to Andy. My thought was that maybe I could record these songs with the remaining members of Mother Love Bone and that maybe we could release them as a tribute.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8p099INi00JSM3MOmFkZzQxmIJ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74382,"logo_path":"/3W1gOKEbPfvL0O0tEusVvYuI8Ju.png","name":"A\u0026M Records","origin_country":"US"},{"id":9339,"logo_path":"/hwEpOrIYH7G4Rolt7s2thYquJnD.png","name":"Universal Music Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temple Of The Dog - 25th Anniversary","video":true,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
