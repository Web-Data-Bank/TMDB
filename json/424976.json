Alik, a clarinetist, is the virtuoso in this orchestra whose existence is seriously threatened when its key sponsor is murdered. One night, Alik comes into possession of a hired killer's mysterious telephone, which is used only to commission hits. Manipulated by a crook's daughter with whom he falls hopelessly in love and wishing to save the orchestra at all costs, Alik decides to take on the identity of the killer known as \"The Virtuoso\" and attempt to carry out his contracts. But Alik is a virtuoso musician, not a killer.","popularity":1.247,"poster_path":"/7V9CTv0tYnLFMkTO0JFj1FruKrE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16266,"logo_path":"/4BqNNUJgq1wojHPDgL90oL4LW58.png","name":"Seppia","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films \u0026 Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bravo Virtuoso","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
