Vera's mother wants to help the couple on the jumps and proposes them to the local radio station as \"the perfect couple of the week\". This means that if they marry within four weeks, the sender pays the wedding. The stars are not unfavorable. But just before the wedding date confirmed that Libra and Taurus are an explosive combination. The high-caliber romantic comedy shows in an amusing, subtle way how heavenly influences in relationships can move mountains.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7dkHpFmBZHg3s5TqBh27kAkuOEp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ziegler Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sag einfach ja!","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
