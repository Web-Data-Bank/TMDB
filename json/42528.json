His mother is religious, sympathetic to the Fascists; his father is accused of being a Red. Fando discovers that his mother may have aided in his father's arrest. Sometimes we witness Fando imagining explanations for what's going on; sometimes we see him at play, alone or with his friend Thérèse. Oedipal fantasies and a lad's natural curiosity about sex and death mix with his search for his mother's nature and his father's fate. Will Fando survive the search?","popularity":2.436,"poster_path":"/pOWKG3eGUDPuMjSEbqFaFldCJCQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49800,"logo_path":null,"name":"SATPEC","origin_country":"TN"},{"id":7001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isabelle Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"1971-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Live Death","video":false,"vote_average":5.966,"vote_count":29}
