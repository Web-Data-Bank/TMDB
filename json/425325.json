Each then places a balloon to his or her lips and breathes into it; the balloon then expands and contracts with each inhalation and exhalation. Before long, something curious occurs: their faces relax noticeably. Several subjects begin laughing aloud. A few attempt to repress these outbursts of hilarity. Others appear mentally absent. Still others attempt to articulate their experiences verbally. The intensity of these emotional responses careens out of control, their hilarity is irrepressible. Their laughter is infectious, yet one observes that an element must be present which somehow enhances the potential for affect and empathy. For a moment, all of the lightness of the world seems no further away than a balloon â€“ and yet remains nonetheless evanescent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verbal-Nonverbal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
