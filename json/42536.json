Originally intended to be the first of six films, director Abel Gance realized the full project would be nigh impossible, and never raised the money to complete the other five. The film's legendary reputation is due to the astonishing range of techniques that Gance uses to tell his story, culminating in the final twenty-minute triptych sequence, which alternates widescreen panoramas with complex multiple- image montages projected simultaneously on three screens.","popularity":6.701,"poster_path":"/x0duTwP9rjVpa2O13r1GK8j61qG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82280,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Westi","origin_country":""},{"id":27693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné France","origin_country":""},{"id":9005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Abel Gance","origin_country":""},{"id":9006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isepa-Wengeroff Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Consortium Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société générale des films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1927-04-07","revenue":39448,"runtime":333,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Napoleon","video":false,"vote_average":7.63,"vote_count":138}
