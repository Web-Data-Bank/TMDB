VESPUCCILAND is an exuberant and witty dance for the camera, shot in vivid, defiant color, records half a dozen spitfires (including Ross and fellow San Francisco experimental filmmaker Michael Rudnick) frolicking on a summer morn. Garbed in white costumes and ersatz hoods, the dancers embody the spirits of rebellion, solidarity, anarchy and free expression. Guaranteed to provoke a smile or three, and to evoke nostalgia for the trampled idealism of the 1970s. - Michael Fox","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vespucciland: The Great and the Free","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
