SOSUEME is an unabashed homage to the athletes' graceful, curved movements and the seamless interaction of body and board. Set to a Giacomo Puccini opera enhanced with a spoken-word track by Malcolm McLaren, the film provides unceasing pleasure as a hypnotic escape or an aesthetic tour de force. The joke in the title is explained at the outset by an onscreen confession: \"The filmmaker acknowledges the completely unauthorized and illegal use of sound and image in this film.\" - Michael Fox","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sosueme","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
