The chaos of vacation is checked by the inexorable logic of vacation: day follows night follows day follows night. - Michael Fox","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babuba","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
