The darkness eventually gives way to a roasted-pumpkin orange title card and images of a lovely nude running through the woods.

Every frame conveys joy at being alive (and at making movies). - Michael Fox","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autumnal Diptych","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
