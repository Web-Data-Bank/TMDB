Watch the footage as people get broken, battered and destroyed in some of the most freakish acts caught on home video tape; then watch them do it again. The footage included in this electrifying DVD will leave you on the edge of your seat, filled with shock, gasping for breath as you wait to see the next bizarre clip of video. Witness insane stunts such as Dan G using a power drill to impale a screw into his arm, Trailer Park Mafia's Buckwild getting bit in the nose by a piranha and hilarious pranks like tricking somebody into eating a brownie (which really is a piece of microwaved dog poop). To them Homegrown isn't just a hobby, it's a way of life. And lucky for us they caught it all on tape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83242,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hollymood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Homegrown Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
