In something of a cross between a Keystone Kops comedy and an Edwin S. Porter melodrama, Lady Liberty, Justice (with her blindfold and scale) and Death form a love triangle, with fickle Death getting his comeuppance in the end. The marvelous musical soundtrack by Nik Phelps and live audience reactions to the film make this a warm and fuzzy experience, despite the archetypal gravity of the main characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stupor Mundi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
