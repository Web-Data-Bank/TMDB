The film tumbles through a series of relationships woven around one woman's narration of her parents' marriage. This woman (played by Lilian Mafra) is a fresh and fecund personality who relates the story of her mother's infidelities while sitting naked and pregnant in a garden. Interspersed around this narrative are a number of other scenes which feeds the complex nature of human interaction. Interaction that is sometimes comic, sometimes lonely but, as the very pregnant Mafra indicates, inevitably part of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Via Rio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
