Serra presents her unique vision of eroticism and poetic cinema in a fast-paced collage of dreamlike imagery. Fragments of a poem by C. Breeze are read and manipulated in a manner recalling the tape experiments of Steve Reich. Rich reds and deep blues stutter and sparkle along with her descriptions of love and \"canine sex.\" TURNER is a brief glimpse at Serra's roots in the New York avant-garde and the Film-makers' Cooperative.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turner","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
