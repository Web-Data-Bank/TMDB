The footage captures a landscape known as The Gowanus Canal, an area of Brooklyn, which was once inhabited by a productive port and industrial compound. The area is now overly polluted and is officially registered as a superfund site by the US environmental protection agency. Using the Gowanus Canal and surrounding landscape as a moment for reflection on the past, this film addresses the role of landscape and how it can work to incite memory and exercise reflection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ggVw3bQbz3FuLgklnNDPYHWVZEe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gowanus Haze","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
