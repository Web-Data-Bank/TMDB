This documentary tries, and mostly manages, to balance the picture by capturing private solo improv sessions, both indoors and outdoors, that display Reijseger's mastery over different colors and tones - with the same astounding technique and soulful commitment. Interspersed with beautiful country- and city-side footage that evokes his ever contemplative music, Do You Still? also features intimate and sometimes bitter-sweet statements by Reijseger on his early years, \"career\" choices, mannerisms, anxieties and shortcomings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banlieues Bleues","origin_country":""},{"id":10767,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Huit Production","origin_country":""},{"id":25564,"logo_path":"/hOMyGLs7mSWoDzVkGDYgK0BdVo6.png","name":"Mezzo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do You Still?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
