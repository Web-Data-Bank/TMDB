She believes that fear, ignorance, and pink-ribbon culture are fueling an explosive rate of unnecessary mastectomies in America. Blending medical archival footage with extensive 'collateral damage' suffered by our four women - repeated loss of implants, blood infections caused by multiple surgical procedures, cosmetic nipple exchanges, reactions to cadaver's skin that is used to house breast implants - we learn that breast reconstruction post-mastectomy is no 'boob job.' As Dr. Schnaper advocates breast conservation and debunks breast cancer myths, so the myth of St. Agatha, the Sicilian martyred saint of the breast, offers a commentary on our own confused contemporary moment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Good Breast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
