It is nearly impossible to capture the entire history of metal in the region given its prolific output. Nevertheless, this documentary sheds some light on three metal scenes in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean: Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. The documentary examines how each island's metal scene has been influenced by history, culture, and political context.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Puerto Rico Heavy Metal Studies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2016-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metal Islands: Culture, History, and Politics in Caribbean Heavy Metal Music","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
