This film explores the greatest inter-species friendship on Earth over the course of 40,000 years. Working closely with scientists, we deconstruct the genetic history of your favorite companion and explore how man has consistently re-engineered the dog to adapt to a changing world. An amazing story of how we have taken qualities we cherish from the wolf-loyalty, territory, protection and family-and bred them into a sweet, compliant animal that we call the dog.","popularity":0.993,"poster_path":"/cPhr5ZjtqcFiG2yAvpC4F9yIR9W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evergreen Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Evolution From Wolves To Domesticated Dogs","title":"And Man Created Dog","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
