He refuses to pay his tab of a million dollars to the criminal casino. He is soon shocked to discover Vivian, his bratty, tennis-playing teen daughter has been kidnapped by a smooth-of-skill but slight-of-bod professional, criminal-for-hire Caroline Horner. Alfred suddenly realizes how much his neglected daughter now means to him and makes a typically shrewd decision attesting to his ability to amass millions, and readily agrees to fork over an amount five times his original debt.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A lethal combination","title":"Miami Shakedown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
