The music of Mozart has quite literally been an essential driving force of Daniel Barenboim’s entire life. It remains central to his performing career both as a pianist and as a conductor.  These illuminating performances of Mozart’s last eight great piano concertos admirably demonstrate Barenboim’s dictum that even when a true musician has already performed a familiar work hundreds of times, he or she ‘never accepts that the next note will be played the same way as it was played before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/each4RovS72Atk2LDMwEn0lyey6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79596,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1989-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":255,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart Last 8 Piano Concertos (Daniel Barenboim)","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
