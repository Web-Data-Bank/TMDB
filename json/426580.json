When Siouxsie, sophomore 'undercrust,' crashes the party to avenge her sister's death, a Saturday detention reserved for the privileged seniors of Crestview Academy turns into a date in hell. It's not long before a na√Øve pussycat lover, gay drug dealer, smokin' hot preacher's daughter, squeaky-clean senator's son, and the uninvited younger outsider find themselves locked-up in school with no way out, wondering who (or what) has set them up. Hilarity and suspense ensue while each 'bad kid' pits one against the other, and one by one each falls victim to absurdly gruesome 'accidents' while trying to escape.","popularity":5.48,"poster_path":"/p2O2uHbWRTfLrJw66mFY6eCwuuw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85501,"logo_path":null,"name":"BKG2H Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":85502,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bad Kids","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Detention sucks but it's killer fun","title":"Bad Kids of Crestview Academy","video":false,"vote_average":4.929,"vote_count":42}
