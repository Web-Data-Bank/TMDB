Anselmo is a taciturn shepherd who lives a spartan life on a small farm in the Spanish plains. When he is approached by a construction company looking to buy his land, his casual refusal sends ripples through the community. It seems everyone around him has a stake in the development and increasingly extreme opposition from his neighbours leads to bitter conflict.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xzUDZrl4yRy23nbYEmAaPWCTh5J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92084,"logo_path":"/rfpdPq9SWibUODr5JOHMqtijsoD.png","name":"Matchbox Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":92085,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jonathan Cenzual Burley","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shepherd","video":false,"vote_average":8.9,"vote_count":7}
