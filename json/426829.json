Many Beautiful Things plunges viewers into the complex age of Victorian England to meet Lilias Trotter, a daring young woman who defied all norms by winning the favor of England's top art critic, John Ruskin.  In an era when women were thought incapable of producing high art, Ruskin promised that her work could be \"immortal.\"  But with her legacy on the line, Lilias made a stunning decision that bids us to question the limits of sacrifice.  As Lilias journeys to French Algeria in the late 1800s to pioneer work with women and children, viewers are left to wonder, \"Could you abandon a dream to pursue your true calling?\"  Featuring the voices of Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey) and John Rhys-Davies (Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones).","popularity":0.645,"poster_path":"/yazDp1anjLymTkHmHMp7vaN1fIP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oxvision Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2680,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kurosawa Production","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Could you give up a dream to pursue your true calling?","title":"Many Beautiful Things","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
