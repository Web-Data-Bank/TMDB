His parents want David to study to become a pharmacist. But what he really wants is to be an actor like his idol, Ronald Colman. One day, at his friend Marvin's suggestion, David tries out for a part in a play, and gets it, despite his obvious lack of acting experience (not to mention ability). True, it's a rather small part in a low-rent production. Leading the troupe is a washed-up, alcoholic actor who hires David at the urging of his actress-daughter, who finds David \"cute.\" To play his part, David must come up with his own costume - a tuxedo - and pay the house five dollars a week, ostensibly for tuition. But it is David's first acting job, one which calls for him to \"enter laughing.\" And if it doesn't work out - well, there's always pharmacy school.","popularity":0.815,"poster_path":"/7YdI1eCfG8N8xqvGhyezjODGGc9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Acre Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":137794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sajo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The picture that brings you the hilarious answer to WHY BOYS LEAVE HOME!","title":"Enter Laughing","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":5}
