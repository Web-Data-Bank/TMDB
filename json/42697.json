An interior monologue narrative approach is used throughout the film, where each principal person shown not only decided on what they wanted to be filmed doing, but also narrated their own scenes. The film opens with Gypsy Boots (the original hippie vegan - desert hopping blender salesman), and stripper Jennie Lee, working out 'Watusi-style' beneath the 'Hollywood' sign -- leading into the 'sustainable community' insight of Lewis Beach Marvin III, the S&amp;H Green Stamp heir, who lived in a $10 a month garage while owning a mountain retreat in Malibu.","popularity":0.668,"poster_path":"/fHxuHXKdZpk4DfUPEV9a5IbmgUO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Omega-Cyrano Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":117308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emerson Film Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hollywood laid bare!","title":"Mondo Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
