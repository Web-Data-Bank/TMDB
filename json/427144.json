Underground trains, streetcars, buses and escalators embody the impressionistic beauty of architectural reflections like moving paintings. The face of the city is rendered as a light-infused intersection of people, glass, and concrete. Part 1 takes place underground, with an audio collage mixed from ambient recordings of subway stations and trains. Part 2 takes place above ground and features an original score with gamelans, guitar loops, sampled car door locks and brake pumps. â€“ KPR","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arcs of Texture","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
