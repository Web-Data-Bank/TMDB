In the main event, Michael Chandler, in his second stint as Bellator lightweight champion, puts the title he won in June on the line against former UFC lightweight titleholder Benson Henderson.  In the co-main event, Michael Page, one of the most electrifying fighters on the Bellator roster, faces Fernando Gonzalez in a fight that was booked and scratched on two previous occasions.  The fight card also features the professional debuts of Keri Anne Taylor-Melendez and “Baby Slice,” Kevin Ferguson Jr.  Bellator 165 takes place at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif.
