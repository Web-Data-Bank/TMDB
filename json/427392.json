A hip-hop subgenre was born - coke rap - and brothers Malice and Pusha T were the centerpieces in a storm of sudden stardom. But despite the tremendous success Malice achieved, he was left questioning the significance and value of his pursuits in the music industry. Throughout the next decade the Thornton brothers made music that would forever influence a generation of hip hop fans, while Gene descended deeper into guilt and personal turmoil. Finally, at the breaking point, with a multi-million dollar drug bust taking down his manager and several members of his inner circle, Gene chose to turn away from the rap game and start a journey of spiritual renewal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of Malice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
