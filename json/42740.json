His only hobby is collecting butterflies, which gives him a feeling of power and control that is otherwise totally missing from his life. He comes into a large sum of money and buys himself a country house. Still unable to make himself at ease socially, he starts to plan on acquiring a girlfriend - in the same manner as he collects butterflies. He prepares the cellar of the house to be a collecting jar and stalks his victim over several days.","popularity":8.288,"poster_path":"/noTdaoKdVfc3wO2RxsgljVPTLzX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19370,"logo_path":null,"name":"Collector Company","origin_country":""},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Almost a love story.","title":"The Collector","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":165}
