The prize fight films, so-called, are either taken by the fight promoters and retained by them for exhibition, not on sale and cannot be procured, or else they are the boldest fake reproductions put up the day following the fight by cheap, so-called fighters, who endeavor, to the best of their ability and under the direction of the enterprising photographer, to represent or reproduce as nearly as possible the scrap which occured the evening before between the genuine principles. It is easy to see how very little real value films produced in these ways possess for the average public, which quick to see that the so-called priniples in the fight are not the men they are advertised to be, and the fight is not the real thing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1901-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gans-McGovern Fight","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
