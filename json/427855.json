An account of minimal â€“but essential- stories, with a letter as unifying element of all of them and which together make up the idiosyncrasy of the women of Ethiopia. A story about women who challenge the difficulties of the world in which they have had to live with perseverance, effort, dignity, sensitivity and much firmness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muna","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
