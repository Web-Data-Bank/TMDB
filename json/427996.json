He is no doubt one of the last fans, given how the group she sings in is tanking! The day he accidentally crosses paths with his idol, Omen offers to be her \"multi-purpose handyman driver.\" Against her group's advice, Stan takes this little white guy on board. It's true he often seems half-asleep, bordering on a total screw-up, and she seems to be the only one to glimpse his (well hidden) talents.","popularity":0.913,"poster_path":"/m0yP9o0mfI7FCb6nPNst0fzLiBQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30432,"logo_path":"/7TlySFa08WRjn1X6m2KJyWtgukN.png","name":"Blue Monday Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Fine Équipe","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":15}
