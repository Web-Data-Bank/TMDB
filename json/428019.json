The Parakana Indians undergo the first contact which begins the process of their pacification. They are attracted by presents laid out in the forest, then settled around camps. They are then confined to indigenous reservations before being completely assimilated by our conquering civilization. All such pacification is initiated through strategic or economic pretexts. The Amerindian civilizations of the Brazilian Amazon are either dying or definitely defunct.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":"/RzOjGiq7doCccw9P48YGQUbFn2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La guerre de pacification en Amazonie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
