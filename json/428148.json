His daily life is anything but calm – not only is Arnaud struggling to convince producers and bankers to invest in his next film, but also he's juggling two women: Chloe, his demanding fiancé, and Gabrielle, a young and ambitious actress who he falls in love with. But when a sudden death in the family occurs, Arnaud is forced to get his act together and take a closer look at what he truly wants. With sardonic humor and a wry tenderness, Viard’s new film is a deeply personal portrait of a man’s mid-life crisis and eventual self-discovery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris, Love, Cut","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
