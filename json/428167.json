She tries to establish a rhythm through every day routines such as eating,  sleeping and washing. We see one of here childhood memories-an Alsatian dog  licks a girl’s heel and rests its head between her legs- and a dream, in which she  is standing naked I a pit which could be a grave. In addition we see a magnified  symbolic version of her surroundings, particularly of insects. Shots of windows,  doors and mirrors convey a sense of menace and introspection. Thanks to measured performance by Marion van Wijk, superb lighting, black and white photography and well balanced editing. The Ants is a highly compelling and evocative film.\" (A.de Ronde)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
