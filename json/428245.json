Before she knows it, she is warned by her mother: \"don't be like Sou'ad\" - referring to the sad story about a rebellious \"bad girl\" whose story became a myth in the village. Accused and imprisoned as a PLO activist back in the 70's, Sou'ad is more than just a role model for the young director. But when she deepening her research, her trouble really begins.
