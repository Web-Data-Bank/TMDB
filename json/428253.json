The talk becomes a discussion. The discussion in fight. And some fights can be irreconcilable. Each of them will go through the city separately, meeting with friends, family and even strangers, generating situations that will lead them to question how and why they got where they are. An external and internal journey, with learnings and reflections about love, the couple and life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gUGaw3EDYTaaOXSTptC8jVt3rn8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alone in the City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
