Having lost her husband, the mother makes the heart achingly painful decision to leave her homeland, in search of safety and a brighter future for her children. Filmed over three years, the film chronicles the family's journey from the front-line in Aleppo, to a little town in Germany. Escaping the chaos and terror of their war torn homeland becomes a catalyst for a different kind of struggle; the struggle to understand your past and accept your present, to adapt to a new life, to hold on to hope, and the idea of belonging to a homeland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bJ2LZYl4Pj1MTp7CH3bgNN4ENbn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67906,"logo_path":"/Ad78qLMFwcHCodkXPb2BQFfdjx2.png","name":"ITN Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"2016-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watani: My Homeland","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":15}
