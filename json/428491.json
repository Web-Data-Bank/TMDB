Ursula (Ana Polvorosa) is a mother and she is living two tragedies at the same time, a zombie invasion and the fact that her husband left home with their son, Nicolas. To Ursula, the zombie invasion is just “an anecdote” because she, as a mother and as a woman, only cares about her missing child, helpless and alone in a world surrounded by green and crazy beings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bntlFfolj4nme7S6HQmtdu3CMHv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amor de madre","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4}
