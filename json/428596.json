From humble beginnings in war-torn Yugoslavia to his adopted home in Australia, Sasa Sestic's journey to the 2015 World Barista Championships is a long one. But his dedication and pursuit of excellence carries him through as do his family, his staff, coffee growers and roasters and the vendors who travel with him on this remarkable journey.
