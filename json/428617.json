Its protagonist tells a story of her life-long coming out as an “oviparous person.” The video incorporates some sci-fi elements (concerning human oviparity) with its depiction of everyday life within the largest city of Kazakhstan. Through its use of humor and the quotidian, human oviparity as a mark of radical difference can be seen in relation to the demonization of transgender life in oppressive societies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Layer: A Day in a Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
