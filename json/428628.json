But peace doesnâ€™t last long: he tries to seduce a country-woman and she invites a mongrel over to her bedroom. The film is, in essence, a melodrama filled with jealousy and betrayal, but it also showcases some original elements that no other cinematography would have dared to suggest in 1929, like the possibility of a romance between an Indian and a white woman (with her taking the first step).","popularity":0.727,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1928-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La quena de la muerte","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
