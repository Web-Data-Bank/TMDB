In an attempt to restore these blissful times, he gives his father a beautiful second-hand camera as a birthday present. As soon as the camera is put to use however, some rather strange and disturbing events unfold, which lead Jonas to suspect that there’s something not quite right about the birthday gift. Jonas subsequently discovers the terrible truth about this camera and realises it holds a dark secret of demonic power. In the end, the camera succeeds in bringing his family closer together, albeit for only a very brief moment, but ultimately it triggers complete destruction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snapshot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
