The two documentaries are a faithful and realistic portrait of the first decade of Punk in Portugal. This second documentary starts in 1982 with the birth of a second wave – more combative and involved with the punk scene -  of Portuguese punk bands like ‘Crise Total’, ‘Grito Final’, ‘Kú-de-Judas’, Mata-Ratos or Peste &amp; Sida and ends around 1988. The history is told not only by the musicians but also by anonymous punk’s or even concerned parents. It’s an interesting narration that evolves around music but also around aesthetical, political, educational, legal and ethical dimensions of Punk.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2016-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buried in Madness – Punk in Portugal 78-88 - The Second Wave","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
