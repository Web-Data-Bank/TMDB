A crew of six men can be seen shoveling dirt into a four-wheeled wooden cart. Then a full cart is slowly lifted out of the pit to street level by a steam-powered crane. These carts are similar in design to those shown dumping rubble at the end of the film New York City Dumping Wharf. Advertisements and campaign posters can be seen on the exposed wall of the building in the background.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1903-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lifting a Wagon from a New York Foundation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
