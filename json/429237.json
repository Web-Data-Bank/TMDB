It's long form entertainment for short attention spans. An hour long VJ odyssey, it will move your body and warp your mind.  A nostalgic look back at a half remembered childhood growing up in the 80s and early 90s, Skinemax takes a close look at the culture of that era. The images that motivated, delighted, and terrified us on the silver screen, set to propulsive modern music that pines for a simpler time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rYBO5Anm1W9WkFxUkVzGgsI0rD4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"STARRING KURT RUSSELL","title":"Skinemax","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
