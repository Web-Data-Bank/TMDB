The camera glides around a complex network of empty walkways in South London’s soon-to-be-demolished Heygate Estate, with the seamless movement of a computer game. Every detail is precisely planned and produced, from the perfect spring weather to the child actors playing in communal spaces. We are forcefully drawn into the image as the camera glides through the estate’s narrow paths, creating a metaphor for the linear nature of film itself, always moving on. Through this travelling motion, the architecture of the Heygate Estate is animated as a constant stream of images and information, highlighting how we, as viewers, understand the world around us, and what impact it can have on us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Games, Heygate Estate","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
