The film also traces the portrait of their friend Rudolf Fahrner, founder of the Institute, comrade of the Stauffenberg Brothers and one of the few conspirators of the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, on 20 July 1944, that survived the repression that followed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1FkUkDxun4fVCiDXmzCm9RqDmEN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154172,"logo_path":null,"name":"AIA Films","origin_country":""},{"id":157982,"logo_path":null,"name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goethe Institut","origin_country":""},{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":144968,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vidéo de Poche","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lichtblick Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":22627,"logo_path":"/mZsZ3IYzoheUPTPN3WeFwOYxAkP.png","name":"Film- und Medienstiftung NRW","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2016-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letters from Athens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
