To make the film, the Heins cut these numerous small images into little strips which they manipulated by hand on a Movieola viewing machine. While one of them maneuvered the strips (inserted them into the machine and moved them in different directions), the other filmed the projected image as it appeared on the machine's small screen. They described the effect of this process as follows: \"While filming the many different little strips (hundreds of them) a rhythm is gradually established: quick and slow changes, pauses, a stronger movement of the pieces and a slow insertion, their sudden appearance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2tPctFc9Ob6cl2XlkQBvn19KSmY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reproductions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
