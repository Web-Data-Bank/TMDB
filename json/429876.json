As the three women negotiate the dangerous relationships among them, the seven women directors weave a sensual tale of suspense. Drawing inspiration from the poem by Jessica Wilbur and the surrealist parlour game, The Exquisite Corpse, each director selected a word or phrase on which to base her segment, and the seven chapters of the film bear their individual marks. This impressive experiment in filmmaking emerges as a sensitive tale of young desire, loss, and love's confusion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brushfires","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":2}
