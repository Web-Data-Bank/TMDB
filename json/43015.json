However, their purifying experiments arouse the prehistoric monster Obaki from hibernation at the lake's bottom, and it proceeds to attack Japan. Although made by a U.S. independent film company, this film was based on a Japanese Toho monster film of 1958, \"Daikaiju Varan\", from which all of the monster effects scenes and a few incidental dramatic shots were edited into it.","popularity":3.849,"poster_path":"/y2PG9VSAxCdgqoJ6uuHla4pjKhk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86054,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cory Film Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":86055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dallas Production Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":1009,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crown International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From a world below, it came to terrorize - to destroy - to revenge!","title":"Varan the Unbelievable","video":false,"vote_average":4.35,"vote_count":20}
