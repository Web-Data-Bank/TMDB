Beginning with the return journey to Cairo of a filmmaker long absent from her own country, the film weaves a series of intimate portraits composed of interviews, poetic voice-over and dance; exploring themes of oppression, guilt and faith with Egyptian women, many of them artists. Reflecting on Carl Theodor Dreyer’s 1928 film ‘The Passion of Joan of Arc’ – in which the female figure is martyred by the patriarchal forces surrounding her – ‘Jeanne’ is a contemporary commentary that melds documentary and dance with poetic storytelling and myth to arrive at the core of the filmmaker’s enquiries into the circumstances of women in Egypt today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8f4an3ikiEbn4hIL4MkaO5qgYp1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"KW","name":"Kuwait"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Egyptian Jeanne d’Arc","title":"Egyptian Joan of Arc","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
