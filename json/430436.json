Though the source film was made a few years after the policies known as the Great Leap Forward were implemented, a reference to them occurs in a phrase from the film’s English language narration that has been adopted as this Discrepancy video’s subtitle. Two sequences of the original film, edited in ever-quicker alternations, culminate in an apocalyptic, stroboscopic mushroom cloud. Discrepancy is the generic title for a group of works that are distinguished with parenthetical subtitles.  All versions of Discrepancy have the same soundtrack and are the same length (9 minutes, 30 seconds). Only the image tracks vary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discrepancy (A New All Around Leap Forward Situation Is Emerging)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
