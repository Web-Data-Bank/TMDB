This sexploitation film, unfortunately lost, and never seen again after 1968, was shot in different styles, sometimes imitating Godard, Bergman, Truffaut or Bertolucci. The producer hated it and Brian DePalma wrote a funny article about it in the Village Voice. All that remains of it is a 35mm trailer and 8 reels of 16mm work print without sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sensualist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
