After the release of his new album the panic rocker No. 1 went on a big tour, where he - among other locations - also stopped in Leipzig. The live recording “Stärker als die Zeit - Live” documents this gigantic show. The recording from Leipzig is a colorful mix of Udo classics and hits from his new album, including \"Cello\", \"Wozu sind Kriege da\", \"Der Greis ist heiß\", \"Ich mach mein Ding\" and \"Durch die schweren Zeiten\". At least as impressive as the tracklist is the list of guest singers who were at Udo's side during the various appearances. Participants include Clueso, Helge Schneider, Till Brönner and Stefanie Heinzmann, Gentleman, Daniel Wirtz and Ole Feddersen, Axel Prahl, Otto Waalkes, Johannes Oerding, Jan Delay, Stefan Raab, Klaus Doldinger, Adel Tawil, Max Herre, Bülent Ceylan and many more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rvyxJvOvQNuouFYQc2Mc1iMq41j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":115181,"logo_path":null,"name":"svenson suite","origin_country":""},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":12700,"logo_path":"/4Bw5eCs1SdRXDmTI84kfuqk6Gqm.png","name":"Warner Music Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The live recording “Stärker als die Zeit - Live” documents Udo's Leipzig concert","title":"Udo Lindenberg: Stärker als die Zeit - Live","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
