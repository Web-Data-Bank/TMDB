He hires Niko, a down-on-his-luck tour guide, to drive him to the poet's home and places of inspiration to stimulate his own translation. On the road, the ghost of Carsten's wife appears to him, while Niko struggles with the sudden consequences of his girlfriend's pregnancy. On this journey, two very different men come to realize the transforming power of love, the limits of language, and the human need for friendship.","popularity":0.989,"poster_path":"/mgwZvl0DwS1GIborSGlpTGomrJD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gestell Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""},{"id":108595,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lichtbogen Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":108596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Properfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2016-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gavagai","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
