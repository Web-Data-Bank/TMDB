Soldiers made hot chocolate from their D-rations, company cooks made donuts and cookies for the children, and 22-year-old corporal Richard Brookins from Rochester, NY played the role of Saint Nick. An emotional and heartfelt story, THE AMERICAN SAINT NICK illustrates how American soldiers and residents of the hamlet were able to bond over a moment in time, creating a tradition that continues to this day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The American St. Nick","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
