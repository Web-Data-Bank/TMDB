In 1981, a stage production of Pippin was videotaped for Canadian television. The stage production was directed by Kathryn Doby, Bob Fosse's dance captain for the original Broadway production, and David Sheehan directed the video adaptation, with Roger O. Hirson in charge of the music. Ben Vereen returned for the role of Leading Player, while William Katt played the role of Pippin. However, this version was a truncated adaptation and several sections of the play were cut. An extended version running 135 minutes is also available.","popularity":2.353,"poster_path":"/2IO6ex3K19wnFsjL7xyIuEVASlf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elkins Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":4343,"logo_path":"/rXq1B1Hnkdnw6soz1zoGcslK3wb.png","name":"Showtime Networks","origin_country":"US"},{"id":155082,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sheehan-Tele-Scenes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"His Life and Times","title":"Pippin","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":8}
