Livia's fighting trainer Molok informs her that her opponent in her next fight is the powerful Fabiola who is nicknamed \"The Tigress Of Rome.\" The big fight will be in only ten days and Molok gives clear instructions that in the week before the fight, Livia must not have any sex as this will break her concentration and make her unprepared. This could be a problem, though, as Livia has a rather large appetite for sex and is carrying on a lesbian affair with fellow gladiator Daria. However, she also lusts for the handsome Molok and wants to get it on with him. Molok is reluctant but Livia insists that since it's ten days till the fight and she only needs to stay away from sex the week before, they have three days to satisfy their desires.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uVYCe6ea1LiKuxxmxZ7DRNEAEos.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72394,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema 80","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1983-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virgin for the Roman Empire","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
