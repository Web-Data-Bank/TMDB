He arranges for his fellow bookies, especially Sorrowful Jones, to each pay him $1,000 for his racehorse, Dream Prince, to lose. With all bets being placed at the window, Sorrowful encounters a gambler, having lost $500, wanting to place his bet but is unable to come up with $20. Instead, he places his daughter, Marthy Jane (Shirley Temple), as security, or in bookie's terms, a \"marker\". Having lost his bet, he commits suicide, leaving \"little Miss Marker\" under the care of Sorrowful Jones. As Steve hides out in Chicago to avoid investigation for his crooked bets, he entrusts Sorrowful to watch over Bangles during his absence, at which time the \"gold digger\" helps \"tight-wod\" with his trouble. When Big Steve learns Bangles is involved with Sorrowful, he returns to New York to do something about it.","popularity":1.977,"poster_path":"/mc0jSyOqiWPunXTkTzOXl8yw3Cd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Miss Marker","video":false,"vote_average":6.538,"vote_count":13}
