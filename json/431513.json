Natural history photographer Clay Bolt is on a multi-year quest to tell the stories of our native bees, and one elusive species – the Rusty-patched Bumble Bee – has become his white whale.  Traveling from state to state in search of the Rusty-patched, he meets the scientists and conservationists working tirelessly to preserve it. Clay’s journey finally brings him to Wisconsin, where he comes face to face with his quarry and discovers an answer to the question that has been nagging him: why save a species?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":56421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Day's Edge Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The last word in ignorance is the man who says of an animal or plant: \"What good is it?\"","title":"A Ghost In The Making","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
