Jōtarō Kūjō, now a marine biologist, heads to the mysterious town to meet Jōsuke Higashikata. While the two may seem like strangers at first, Jōsuke is actually the illegitimate child of Jōtarō's grandfather, Joseph Joestar. When they meet, Jōtarō realizes that he may have more in common with Jōsuke than just a blood relation. Along with the mild-mannered Kōichi Hirose and the boisterous Okuyasu Nijimura, the group dedicates themselves to investigating recent disappearances and other suspicious occurrences within Morioh. Aided by the power of Stands, the four men will encounter danger at every street corner, as it is up to them to unravel the town's secrets, before another occurs.","popularity":10.555,"poster_path":"/sAfNSZ8Th0nb979e6ss5ftTT0Rh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":882,"logo_path":"/iDw9Xxok1d9WAM2zFicI8p3khTH.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5372,"logo_path":"/tPtJc2rCOTHEzJQPStT6m3dI0eK.png","name":"OLM","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":142136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Raku Film","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":156828,"logo_path":null,"name":"b-mount film","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":1393,"logo_path":"/lUACMATs6jcscXIrzNCQzbvNVN5.png","name":"TBS","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3627,"logo_path":"/i1eW4O13B28b4JHpIL5C9rRiiur.png","name":"Warner Bros.
