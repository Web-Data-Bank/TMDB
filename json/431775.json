But it’s the films’ fleeting, in-between, moments where Pennebaker most precisely hits the mark, offering reflection on the possibilities that Robert Kennedy’s all too brief life foreclosed. Set against the pageantry of a long ago Christmas, the film speaks to tragic contingencies of history lying far beyond the ken of politics that continue to circumscribe the tortured destiny of our country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jingle Bells: RFK - 1964","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
