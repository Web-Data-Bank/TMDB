Backed by his long-time band, he treated the audience to classics from his much-loved late '60s EPs and legendary\" Outlander\" and \"Gwymon\" albums, as well as more recent material. Ranging from fragile ballads to out-and-out psychedelic rock, the resultant film captures a master singer-songwriter at the top of his game, and is essential viewing for all fans of acid folk.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening With Meic Stevens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
