They continue to cope with the loss of their families as the killers who created this trauma return from jail back to the villages where they once lived. Faced with these perpetrators on a daily basis, the victims must decide whether they can forgive them or not. Their decisions are unfathomable to many, and speak to a humanity that has survived the worst violence imaginable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"RW","name":"Rwanda"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kinyarwanda","iso_639_1":"rw","name":"Kinyarwanda"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"When hate persists, how will you coexist?","title":"Coexist","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2}
