It looks at imaginations of homes across four examples of buildings made over the period of a century. These are Lukhshmi Vilas Palace in Baroda – the gigantic home built by a progressive monarch in the late 19th Century; Villa Shodhan in Ahmedabad – a private residence which represents the idea of domesticity within Nehruvian modernity, designed by Le Corbusier; Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, which epitomises the Gandhian aspirations of the nation-state; and public housing in post-independence Delhi, designed by the Government of India to house refugees from Pakistan and the bureaucrats of the newly independent nation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fjeHDnf3YYVRcDIIeI029sabEYm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nostalgia for the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
