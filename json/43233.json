At the university he has to do the bidding of absent-minded and boring Professor Welch to have any hope of keeping his job. Worse, he has managed to get entangled with unexciting but neurotic Margaret Peel, a friend of the Professor's. All-in-all, the pub is the only friendly place to be. His misery is completed at a dreadful weekend gathering of the Welch clan by the arrival of son Bertrand. Not so much that Betrand is loud-mouthed and boorish - which he is - but that he has as companion Christine Callaghan, the sort of marvellous and unattainable woman Jim can only dream about.","popularity":2.051,"poster_path":"/jahDqzErAv8H1vIA9m4iTHRJ4p8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":632,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Lion Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charter Film Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":14884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boulting Brothers","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1957-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Rollicking Lampoon of University High- and Low-Life!","title":"Lucky Jim","video":false,"vote_average":5.417,"vote_count":18}
