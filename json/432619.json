What starts out as a struggle for racial and labor justice, soon becomes a fight for gender equality within the same union she is eventually forced to leave. As she wrestles with raising 11 children, three marriages, and is nearly beaten to death by a San Francisco tactical police squad, Dolores emerges with a vision that connects her new found feminism with racial and class justice.","popularity":0.895,"poster_path":"/vmltoSoV2ta9vZITuVYoDRG8DLe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Lens","origin_country":"US"},{"id":66478,"logo_path":"/u7WmMkfo9MqsqfD5cuDAbd0u1qY.png","name":"Artemis Rising","origin_country":"US"},{"id":105516,"logo_path":"/j1FgbOz1NFwt6iEhdd05dWwr7Z2.png","name":"Latino Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stick Films","origin_country":""},{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rebel.
