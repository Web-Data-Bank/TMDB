The fate of the 19th century traditional mortuary pole remained unknown for over 60 years until it was discovered in a Stockholm museum where it is considered state property by the Swedish government. Director Gil Cardinal combines interviews, striking imagery and rare footage of master carvers to raise questions about ownership and the meaning of Aboriginal objects held in museums.","popularity":1.095,"poster_path":"/22mvpesihjUCdxrXhD3TbsA6qj0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Totem: The Return of the G'psgolox Pole","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
