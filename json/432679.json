The music is sub­lime. Not even a pin would dare drop. Sud­denly, a cell­phone rings and the mad­ness starts. The pianist loses his hand, the vio­lin­ist, while tun­ing, falls asleep, and later wakes up in the mid­dle of a motor­way, trans­formed into a “River­dancer”. When the pianist returns, the piano is locked, telling him to insert his credit card. Mean­while, the vio­lin­ist loses his bow to a vac­uum cleaner and his part­ner just talks on the phone while read­ing a paper, eat­ing, and, play­ing the piano upside down all at the same time. These and many other “night­mares” unfold before audi­ences’ eyes and ears.  “A Lit­tle Night­mare Music” is a unique show, full of vir­tu­os­ity, enchant­ing music and zany, out­ra­geous humour. Ideal for audi­ences aged 8 to 88, this show is sure to cap­ti­vate you and crack you up whether you’re a clas­si­cal music enthu­si­ast or the type who runs for cover, at the mere men­tion of Mozart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xmTtcnmeYsAVRKPkBlppzLjIepq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neonfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2010-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Little Nightmare Music","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
