In the role of her single father, who is planning to make a new offspring with his new girlfriend - played by Katharina Schüttler - Benno Fürmann can be seen. Director David Dietl tells the story in a humorous way, without losing sight of the seriousness of the topic.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/vc2ywkfuC2dloIiSNT2gRClEg4U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ellas Baby","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
