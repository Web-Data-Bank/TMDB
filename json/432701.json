Not much happens plotwise: Acuff, playing \"himself,\" is a tenderfoot who somehow manages to come out on top when he heads westward. The villains (who aren't all that villainous) try to promote a phony stock deal, but Roy and his pals foils their plans. The comedy honors go to Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams as a blowhard sheriff. Smoky Mountain Melody was scripted by Barry Shipman, the son of pioneering female filmmaker Nell Shipman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rFfSAm799MS6XiB0HAsJJgasXHm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SWING YOUR SWEETIE to the...SMOKY MOUNTAIN MELODY","title":"Smoky Mountain Melody","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
