Members of his team are people with a complicated past. Among them is also Feliks (Tomasz Ziętek), full of ideals, privately the husband of Nowacki's daughter (Agnieszka Żulewska), who should never have found himself in a prisoner. The prison director, having lost control of the convoy, chases to repair, and may hide the uncomfortable truth for him. The real purpose of the convoy is slowly coming to light.
