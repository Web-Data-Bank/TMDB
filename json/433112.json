She is introduced to Austin, who for years has been one of the major players in fashion lingerie, though recently his company has been suffering a dry spell. He is a notorious womanizer, and when he meets her, he wastes no time as he attempts to lure her into bed. She is more than interested, and soon the two are engaged in a very passionate affair.
