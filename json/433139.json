A documentary on three blind people who devote their lives to creating images. What do they see in their mind's eyes? Do they sense that which we sighted miss, overlook, or don't take into consideration? Their images, as we sighted can see, are extraordinary. \"Even with no input the brain keeps creating images,\" says Pete Eckert. Sonia Soberats states, \"I only understood how powerful light is after I went blind.\" Shot in the Dark is a journey into an unfamiliar yet fascinating realm. \"My camera is like a bridge,\" claims Bruce Hall. All these photographers embrace fantasy, chance, and contingency at a fundamental level. Shot in the Dark enriches our understanding of perception and creation. We all close our eyes in sleep, the sighted and blind alike, and in our dreams - we see.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ncKR22iQKlImMPGKpUv8CaEoa7p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weltfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shot in the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
