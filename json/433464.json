They find themselves abandoned in a desolate land and without help and so they’re forced to live together and confront, but above all battle with hunger which brings them face to face with extreme situations. And it’s from this experience that their lives radically change, especially the man who was frenetic and angry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2004-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Food","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
