It was a fight that swung back and forth between the two main protagonists. Nico kicked off the season with four consecutive wins while Lewis was slow off the mark thanks to bad starts and poor reliability.

The drama went down to the final round in Abu Dhabi. Lewis had nothing to lose while Nico had to keep his cool.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iDuWIEK6DjvNBZK8LvFGbjHXVcW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85203,"logo_path":null,"name":"FOM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":247,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They Did Their Best","title":"F1 2016 Official Review","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
