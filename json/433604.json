Explore some of the 300 newly discovered waterfalls most tourists never get to see. Learn how wolves, back after five decades of absence from Yellowstone, are helping restore the balance in the ecosystem alongside the grizzly bear and bison. Finally, discover how the geology of Yellowstone with its giant well of molten lava underneath the surface is sometimes more dangerous than the wildlife. So serene and yet so dangerous, this powerful drama comes alive through satellite imagery and CGI animation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bG2XsFvQRQo83uxrhpNi2FgDDZi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123388,"logo_path":"/fAtGS8zDA5g2Qovf7uwPgiD2zID.png","name":"National Geographic Channels International","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Yosemite","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
