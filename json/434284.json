Dawn starts then to draw silhouettes of dunes while motionless figures punctuate landscape. From night´s abstraction, light returns its dimension to space and their volume to bodies.  Stillness concentrates gaze and duration densify it. The adhan -muslim call to pray- sounds and immobility, that was condensing, begins to irradiate. And now the bodies are those which dissolves into the desert.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/52KnkMtQqlel39GtZigfTpw65Nb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fajr","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
