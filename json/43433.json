But on his young daughter's birthday, like any day, Abu faces a nerve-wracking shift in a Ramallah yellow cab armed only with an ex-jurist's misplaced pride, a father's loyalty, and a sticker reminding passengers that smoking and carrying AK-47s are prohibited. Rather than address politics or document holy war heroics and villainy, Laila's Birthday focuses on the toll that the unending Palestinian-Israeli conflict extracts from civilians clinging to both employment and a semblance of normal life amidst chaos and corruption, missile attacks and bursts of gunfire.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/fssqNghRAOHZc0SYxRXA1BEB1cF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Production Center","origin_country":"PS"},{"id":71842,"logo_path":"/zmB7hLD7n4Wxr7o3Vj9o9988vZB.png","name":"Cinétéléfilms","origin_country":"TN"},{"id":121189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sweetwater Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":1615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fortissimo Films","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":121190,"logo_path":null,"name":"BrunBro Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laila's Birthday","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
