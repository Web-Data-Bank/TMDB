In a nearby village he asks around for work, but the farmers, suspicious to the point of hostility, are not very forthcoming. Only when Lucy, the mayor’s unruly daughter, takes a liking to him, does the village change its attitude: he is promptly offered a job as a farmhand and a caravan to live in. As time passes and he is gradually integrated into the community, it emerges that he’s not the only one with a past to hide. Something sinister is lurking under the immaculate surface of this picturesque little world - and it is slowly drawing him in.","popularity":2.993,"poster_path":"/2jYfYrarEQwBPK2x0h7uhhnLMLI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11796,"logo_path":"/tx6LOQcTSqgW8ffKxovuJHjlYVw.png","name":"Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel de la FWB","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":109452,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bauer \u0026 Blum","origin_country":""},{"id":72130,"logo_path":"/2aZx0CKefgtSJEwU5TBLX7oXwyR.png","name":"Les Films Fauves","origin_country":"LU"},{"id":7465,"logo_path":"/e28RwIpRcOSFaeKkzLQBzvMXbK0.png","name":"Novak Prod","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2018-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A surreal village noir","title":"Gutland","video":false,"vote_average":6.052,"vote_count":29}
