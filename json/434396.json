In a kind of homage to Kurosawa's 7 Samurai, the  townspeople have been unable to defend themselves and Inaba sets out to teach  them how to stand up for themselves.  Meanwhile the vile Lord Yasumasa has sent  the 4 finest swordsmen in the clan out to hunt Inaba down and kill him.  Led by the  magnificent Ichibei (Konoe), a master of weaponry in his own right, everything points  to an ultimate showdown between the former friends in a battle to the death.","popularity":0.931,"poster_path":"/26U1rSgtsmpkj7RssSalqF96Lwd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1963-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duel of Blood and Sand","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
