He tries to put his theories into practice again, as he realises that the world has not turned out as he had expected. He founds a new free school with the help of some like-minded people, and starts teaching a new generation who believe in solidarity and cooperation, rather than a system of oppression. But the ideal of freedom and equality awakens the same fears in the choreographers of power as it did 100 years ago. And after an encouraging start the count and his new friends come up against more and more obstacles.","popularity":1.346,"poster_path":"/urPVyeoNfBGcGV1z9bIgfKuyO9C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Café","origin_country":""},{"id":20692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmpartners","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":128330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Focusfox","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":17173,"logo_path":null,"name":"Proton Cinema","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2016-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Most of the Souls That Live Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
