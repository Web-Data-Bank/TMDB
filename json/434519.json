This site-specific simulation, created for the Dazed Emerging Artist Award exhibition at the RA, is accompanied by a soundtrack by virtuoso cellist Oliver Coates and a voiceover of a found text from Russian Tatler magazine, translated into Mandarin by Joni Zhu.  The project forms Chapter 9 of Bonus Levels, a series of critical virtual worlds based on real places. This time, Lek explores the language of high-end property branding and the complex relationship between luxury, desire, and excess.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/46kmWNgpyP47b7KGEkib1Um3PXB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unreal Estate (the Royal Academy is yours)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
