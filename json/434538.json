Quagliata manipulates Agustín Lara’s song, “Veracruz,” together with audio from interviews with activist, poet and film festival promoter Nadia Vera, and freelance photojournalist Rubén Espinosa, both of whom were assassinated. She also includes sound recordings of the young protestors in Xalapa denouncing governor Javier Duarte, and a genocide rarely echoed in the international media: the killing of 100,000 students in Mexico over eight years, their bodies disappeared. Quagliata juxtaposes this amalgam of soundtracks with re-photographed archival images of the drug war, physical violence, harassment and threats by police authorities and their allies, and the homicides of human right defenders and protectors of indigenous territories, as well as of Vera’s friends, also killed with impunity: Yesenia Quiroz, Mile Virginia Martín, and Alejandra Negrete.\" - Mónica Savirón, Museum of the Moving Image","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lTmSClV1EuJ6UgP0NtiG5qi67ED.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2016-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Misters - Without Blame -","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
