Together with his homeless pals, he makes his living by selling his paintings on the street. His paintings, dynamically exploding on pieces of cardboard, catch the eyes of Kyoko, an art dealer. He can feel alive only if he keeps painting, but unable to find something to fill his void inside, he tries to drown himself in alcohol. Drawn to Jouji, Kyoko commissions him to paint for her. The two travel to a secluded mountain-side, and there Jouji becomes inspired both by the natural surroundings and Kyoko herself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oYOku3ZjWpeBWbjcipRFCmMGrrf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Root Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Déracine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
