For, in the midst of the constraints of life in the GDR, there existed a fantasy world where it was possible to dance to another tune, be individual and even provocative. The most important characteristic of this bohemian scene was one’s per- sonal style. But this certainly wasn’t something that could be bought off the peg in the GDR. In this parallel universe it was up to you to create your own individual image – with your own hands. This film tells the story of the desires, the passion and the dreams that were tried and tested, lived and performed in the shadow of the Berlin Wall.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":4313,"logo_path":null,"name":"AVRO Television","origin_country":""},{"id":52190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cobos Films B.V.","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":32536,"logo_path":"/wpvXQ3OrEblZWofZ5aqURpOWgU8.png","name":"LOOKS","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comrade Couture","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
