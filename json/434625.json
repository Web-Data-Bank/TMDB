He loves women but they don’t always understand him. Constantly without money and out of touch with reality.  The elegant fop Daniil Yuvachov names himself Kharms- a name just as effective as his appearance. An habitué of unending literary get-togethers and a lover of scandal. Living in society he is completely separate from it. Kharms throws down a gauntlet to his time, audaciously hurling himself into the vortex of reality, just as vague and arbitrary, with the same contradictions, as represented by his spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9yBrO2ZT4E5zBBgwDYRFdfJBvkj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3327,"logo_path":"/k777rG9ixx6MmzTqUUyYSwI63Ig.png","name":"Proline Film","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":19118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tremora","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":87319,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manufaktura Productions","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are There Miracles?
