The thoughts of the saxophonist Charles Gayle and the bass players William Parker and Peter Kowald from Germany accompany the film. Shot on 16 mm, this film remains one of a kind until today. Some of the recorded musicians have passed away - their spirits live on.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7iQRybIxv0K2sXzQYFS95vYYm0G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rising Tones Cross","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
