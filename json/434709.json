Zorro simply became \"Don Daredevil\" (Ken Curtis), a foppish Easterner by day turned masked avenger by night. Like his not too distant relative, Don wore his disguise in order to battle nasty Roy Barcroft who, under a forged Spanish land grant, attempts to take over the surrounding ranch land.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/ygC3VTnd1JCbXGxVtW6Omhsp70I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"DARING SAGA OF DANGEROUS DAYS!","title":"Don Daredevil Rides Again","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
