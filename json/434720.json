The Champion, in the title, is a Great Dane who has won the title at the Rubeville State Fair, and it isn't long before the Champion turns up dead, which is because somebody---motive unknown at the moment---has killed the Champion. This is repeated at other shows along the way and Quade's bright young assistant, \"Small Fry\", fancies himself as an amateur detective, and starts nosing around into the mystery and drags Quade along with him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b3of7hBu6jzchdlmfJKFRqN29wN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1939-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of a Champion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
