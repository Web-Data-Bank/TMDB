Mike is content on the farm and obviously attracted to the handsome Dan. Dan seems to be attracted to Mike as well but is a drifter and not happy as a farmer. He longs to finish out the contract and move on to a big city, perhaps with Mike. Gary, a boy from the next farm over, befriends them during their daily chores. When an innocent session of skinny-dipping is misconstrued, the young hired hands soon find themselves unjustly suspected of wrongdoing in a suddenly hostile small town.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rcu7NpEyTV1jDflbdtkoVtcfN0B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clay Farmers","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
