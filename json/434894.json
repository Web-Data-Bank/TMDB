Needless to say, this rapidly becomes an underground phenomenon in Taipei. The label of these mind-altering screenings? Made In Taiwan...  With the help of Amy Lin, organised screenings pop up around the city and crowds of eager MIT fans flood in to see his latest creations.  As his films become more popular, Jack fights obsessively to keep complete control of his work. However, he also comes to realise that his films have long-lasting effects on the mind.  With his own constant exposure to the films, Jack begins to slip into a dark, dream world of his own creation from which he may never return.","popularity":0.876,"poster_path":"/w7kRvBfYpl8Xl1cshLt9KmpGQqN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127887,"logo_path":null,"name":"MoQi Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2016-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Made In Taiwan","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
