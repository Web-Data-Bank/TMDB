It is a deep bond, and for many, surfing is a lifelong devotion and a spiritual outlet - a personal experience far removed from its much-hyped and commercialized public persona. For most surfers, surfing is in their blood and it connects them to an extended family that is linked through practice, tradition, craft, emulation, apprenticeship, and shared experience. Surfers' Blood reaches out to those hardcore, dyed-in-the-wool surfers through an honest and beautiful portrayal of their sport and its surrounding culture, while at the same time offering outsiders a peek into the intense undiluted world of surf.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/epxmlyXpaKdGh4jLydHBsQXBs33.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surfers' Blood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
