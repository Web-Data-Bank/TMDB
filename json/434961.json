See what was showing at La Continentale cinema on Tottenham Court Road, slip into a seedy strip club, cut a rug to some cool jazz, and pay a virtual visit to the birthplace of British rock 'n' roll, legendary Soho music venue The 2iâ€™s Coffee Bar.  The 2i's Coffee Bar, established in 1956, was run by two Australian ex-wrestlers, Ray Hunter and Paul Lincoln (aka Doctor Death).
