My Newark film has extraordinary image quality. You won't see anything like this on any other audience shot film!  Newark was much more limited editing wise because I didn't have many other sources but my shoot is so good and so steady (only at some times stupid periscopers and other \"mobile phone people\" got in the way) that with additional footage from friends I was able to create a mighty fantastic film.
