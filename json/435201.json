His passion for electricity also fed his obsessive corpse reanimation experiments, especially after the death of his wife, opera singer Stilla Mihaly. Like an uncertain image catalogue, Peque単o diccionario ilustrado de la electricidad looks over Villeneuve's story with an electrocuted editing speed, creating deluded shots with videographic and animation techniques, but also gobbling up archive footage that ranges from scientific documentaries to fictions from various genres with the energy of the destructive form of Guy Debord's found footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2015-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa単ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peque単o diccionario ilustrado de la electricidad","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
