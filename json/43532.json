Four bus mechanics working for London Transport strike up a deal with the company: they do up a one of the company's legendary red double decker buses and take it to southern Europe as a mobile hotel. If it succeeds, they will be put in charge of a whole fleet. While on the road in France they pick up three young British ladies whose car breaks down and offer to take them to their next singing job in Athens. They also pick up a stowaway, who hides the fact that she's a famous American pop star on the run, chased by the media and her parents.","popularity":5.034,"poster_path":"/aCE8KJGRQ8I5kyhwigtROb8Vcjt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1441,"logo_path":"/28DJnfE2ZaR5oNJVlZ38uvnLaCH.png","name":"Associated British Picture Corporation","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":9266,"logo_path":null,"name":"American International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1963-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the First Kiss to the Last Blush It's the Craziest Riot On Wheels!","title":"Summer Holiday","video":false,"vote_average":5.997,"vote_count":31}
