Itâ€™s midwinter during the trailblazing 1888-89 tour (17 months and a staggering 107 matches) that left a black jersey and silver fern legacy. In a changing room that resembles a casualty ward, Warbrick draws breath and leads a stirring haka. Made by brothers Pere and Meihana Durie, Warbrick inspired the All Blacks the day before a 33-6 demolition of Australia in 2009.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warbrick","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
