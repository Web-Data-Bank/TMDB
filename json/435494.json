For some, riding a bicycle from Virginia to New York -- 320 miles in 5 days -- is pretty doable. For others...you'll have to watch.  For anyone who is interested in the military, veterans, West Point, cycling, or just friendship.  This documentary has no affiliation nor endorsement of the US Army or the United States Military Academy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85574,"logo_path":null,"name":"RD = FC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A friend remembered.
