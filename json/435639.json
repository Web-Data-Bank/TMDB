At the age of 88, Howard Zinn reflects upon the Civil Rights and anti–Vietnam War movements, political empires, history, art, activism, and his political stance. Setting forth his personal views, Noam Chomsky explains the evolution of his libertarian socialist ideals, his vision for a future postcapitalist society, the Enlightenment, the state and empire, and the future of the planet.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theory and Practice: Conversations with Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
