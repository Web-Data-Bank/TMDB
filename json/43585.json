They find something strange and sinister happening there – bones and weird decorations line Main Street. The cause: local Wormwood legend says on All Hallows Eve one hundred years ago, a crazed man tortured the youngsters in town and then cut off their heads. In retaliation, the townspeople killed him by cutting off his head. Seeking revenge every seven years, he returns and takes seven heads from children in the town. Now the seven visitors find themselves hunted one by one as the Headless Horseman claims his due.","popularity":3.861,"poster_path":"/epDv0AW4qUbxqVHCiX1M5tzwxfn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1370,"logo_path":"/uch218gB4XWNz3JNhlc65A5Q207.png","name":"Castel Film","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":10345,"logo_path":null,"name":"Active Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't lose your head","title":"Headless Horseman","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":20}
