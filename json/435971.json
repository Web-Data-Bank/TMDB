Seventeen of them talk about their experience in this remarkable documentary. Stunningly beautiful footage of the earth shot from space serves as the backdrop. Each of these rigorously trained individuals articulates how they were awestruck by the incredible experience of looking back at our unique and fragile home. Each expresses how precious the earth seemed, as it teems with life in an otherwise hostile universe. However, the visible evidence of man's destructive effects on our home, such as the burning of the Amazon rain forests, saddened and worried them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Planet Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
