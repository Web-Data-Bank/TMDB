The cartographer Samuel Feijóo decided to discover the mythical island and for this reason he settled in the middle of the country and regularly published a travel book that looked like a magazine, narrating his own travels through the mythological universe of folk culture. Twenty four years later, a young man wishes to redraw the trip following the trail left by Feijóo in \"Signos\", in such a manner that the trip through the magazine displays on the screen the mythical world of Feijóo, his life and his inclusion in folk culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La isla y los signos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
