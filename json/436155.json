Racing across five time zones, the 14-strong British and Irish crew of ?La Mondiale? compete around the clock, chasing a daunting world record set by an elite team of French legionnaires over fifteen years ago. Leaving from Gran Canaria off the coast of Africa and rowing for over a month in conditions that quickly descend into a surreal recreation of forced labor, the crew make for the Caribbean state of Barbados and a place in the history books.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ocean's 14","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
