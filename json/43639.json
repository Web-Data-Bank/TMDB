As they blindly make their way across an area the locals call THE EYES, the girls are suddenly shocked to see one lone headlight appear behind them. As the driver of the damaged SUV begins one terrifying assault after another, the five girls will lose their innocence and possibly their lives in this brutal and shocking thrill ride.","popularity":2.186,"poster_path":"/felz041N6FY0snBA0oqDCZsOguD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Getting home by curfew is gonna be hell...","title":"Five Across the Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":20}
