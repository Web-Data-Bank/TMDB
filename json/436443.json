But the infatuated writer is struck by a spasm of sorrow when he later sees Mimi make her appearance as a taxi-dancer at a party. The lovers are reconciled by the story of her plight told by her sister Annie. However, Mimi goes missing on the engagement day. By a stroke of luck, Chim runs into the elusive woman again and finds out how she was forced into prostitution by her drug-addict husband, his childhood best friend and benefactor Chan Hung-kit. Chim leaves dejectedly, and has since been idling his days away. The frail Mimi confesses her love for Chim on her deathbed, and from not far away, Chan has ended his own life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":88820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tse Brothers Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
