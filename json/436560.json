However, due to production costs and difficulties in this format, Forsse, AlchemyII and Worlds of Wonder decided animation would be a better route and the 65 episode animated series was created. The pilot episode of what would have been the animatronic series was instead released as a stand-alone ABC Movie of the week in 1986 and also aired in syndication as a 2-part episode.The show can be found on videocassette. The \"animatronic movie\", as it's called by Teddy Ruxpin fans, used primarily the same voice talent as the Teddy Ruxpin toy software had, most of which (with the exception of Phil Baron and Will Ryan) were replaced in the later animated TV series by Canadian voice talent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uNpSPkIe7nXP9B8lL6kFXAb1Sb3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173344,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alchemy II","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
