And, in the pouring rain, amid the mud and shattered trees of a rubber plantation called Long Tan, with their ammunition running out and another Vietnamese battalion massing for the final assault, the digger's situation seemed hopeless. Long Tan is the true story of ordinary boys who became extraordinary men.","popularity":0.701,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2006-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle of Long Tan","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
