Bret Packard is rich, famous, good-looking, and set to win his fourth championship ring. But Bret Packard is bored. That all changes when a teammate is mysteriously stabbed during a ball field brawl. Using this violence as a springboard, Bret begins a new game, a game where only he knows the rules. Using his powers of persuasion, Bret pits teammate against teammate by promising everyone the one thing that they want the most, whether it be power, respect, or cold hard cash. Soon, the entire team is self-destructing, and Bret couldn't be happier. But with their lives and careers on the brink of devastation, Bret's teammates and family realize that they have to take baseball - and life - back from Bret Packard, once and for all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's time to level the playing field.","title":"Ball of Wax","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
