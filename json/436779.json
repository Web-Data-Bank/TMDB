To the accompaniment of the abrupt sonic interjections of Fluxus-affiliated composer Takehisa Kosugi, Yalkut's black and white film records brief, masked actions: an arm with clenching fist; a pair of faces, visible only about the eyes, which squint, gaze, and rest; Paik eating a slice of bread. Reminiscent of Beckett's theater, as well as the minimal movements of 1960s avant-garde dance, Cin√©ma Metaphysique is a study in gesture and stillness, noise and silence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2sOEOpw1u4O7iM1PFFsyz21pdGn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema Metaphysique No. 1-5","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
