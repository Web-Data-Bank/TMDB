Most of these workers are undocumented migrants from Central America whose aspirations have led them to washing cars in the city of angels. This experimental documentary, shot in super8 film, journeys into a city defined by as much by cars as it is immigrant labor to offer a quiet commentary on the relationship between class, place, and work.","popularity":0.879,"poster_path":"/u2cLDObzsE2TyTTcClyrSKrjprZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"car wash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
