This memory is lost. Or is the memory, which invented new. They said to each other Buzz to give daytime and night vision can listen. They are a girl who becomes a kite. And the men who tear the island on the glass. The girl, who later became Mangpor. Become lost memories become memories fabricated on. In a city that became birds. Stoles back into the infinite ocean. The mold may not recognize the language. Pictures without a source A set of memories that still existed in the dim fuzzy. If you are in the clear. The image will leave forever gone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birth of the Seanema","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
