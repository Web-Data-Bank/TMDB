Events take a horrifying turn. Keiko Kirishima is a cool, seemingly emotionless police detective, brilliant but off-putting. She's faced with two mutilated corpses who appear to have killed themselves, but she's not sure. A cell-phone number links the deaths. She calls on Akumu Tantei, a poor and suicidal young man who has the ability to enter people's dreams. He's reluctant to help. His past haunts him. A subconscious duel of terror and blood awaits the three.","popularity":3.005,"poster_path":"/thfveexklQEuFf0X9Y1MGYYkr3l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaijyu Theater","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":6549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movie-Eye Entertainment","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightmare Detective","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":56}
