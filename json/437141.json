As a novelty, Starrett not only plays Durango and his \"alter ego\" Steve Drake, but also takes on a third identity, that of a hired gun in the employ of the film's bad guys. As one critic noted, this may be the only western in which the hero is obliged to chase himself. Jock O'Mahoney -- later known as Jock Mahoney -- plays a secondary role, and also doubles for Starrett during the riskier stunt sequences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/31KEXP8XDY3DFsVPRR9t7MhIDTo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BLASTING A BOGUS VIGILANTE GANG!","title":"Texas Dynamo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
