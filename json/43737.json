In the hope of satiating her obsession with the latter, she instigates a trip to the Welsh countryside with four friends, aimed at tracking down the legendary Beast of Bodmin. It seems the mythical creature – often thought to be a large wildcat or fox – has caught the public's attention once more thanks to a spate of attacks on livestock and one local farmer. Armed with a video camera and a case of beer, the group head off into the woods but they soon uncover much more than they bargained for, with Sophie falling foul of a mysterious madman who locks her away in an apparent attempt to protect her from some unnamed terror.","popularity":1.943,"poster_path":"/AsljbDlQZ42dTMX9o0QDtiRIvAx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51252,"logo_path":null,"name":"BTG McInnes Corporate Finance","origin_country":""},{"id":51253,"logo_path":null,"name":"Splintered Films","origin_country":""},{"id":51254,"logo_path":"/kgWezXWIdSInE9ZOO4rI2TeK1C4.png","name":"Not a Number","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't be Frightened.
