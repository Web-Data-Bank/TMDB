The movie's costumes feature enormous versions of the familiar hats of Robin and his merry men, and uses the unusual effect of momentarily superimposing images different animals over each character to emphasize their good or evil qualities. The film was directed by Étienne Arnaud and Herbert Blaché, and written by Eustace Hale Ball. A restored copy of the 30-minute film exists and was exhibited in 2006 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/yM9HRBdxLtZU5CzWdIQFJfUObIA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eclair American","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robin Hood","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
