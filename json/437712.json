Assisted by grizzled security guard Dale Philip, the crew knows how to handle protesters and saboteurs -- but there's something much, much worse in the woods this time. The local natives say the land is cursed -- haunted by a demonic entity older than time. Now people are going missing, turning up dead or worse, and Josie and the crew are about to discover the truth behind the legend. The most alarming horror is the one you never see coming!","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4659,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plotdigger Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They Were Warned.
