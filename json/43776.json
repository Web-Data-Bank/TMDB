The problem is that every bus that passes by is already full. Their only hope is to wait for the station's bus to be fixed. As the disparate group settles in, relationships start forming between the passengers: Emilio, a young engineer, becomes smitten with a beautiful young woman who is en route to meet her Spanish fiancé, a blind man gets support from the others to go to the head of the line. Frustration and disorder reign when the one bus brakes down and no one can leave. Resigned to working together, the group magically transforms the station into a beautiful place where no one wants to leave.","popularity":1.545,"poster_path":"/tXBnl9AKK95P1IC2P4YZfK3rjo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"},{"id":7680,"logo_path":"/uGcInOaHyvFZ337T5OeQKKVjSCJ.png","name":"Tornasol Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":30766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones Amaranta","origin_country":""},{"id":21113,"logo_path":null,"name":"DMVB Films","origin_country":""},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":65091,"logo_path":"/7D7JB71JEiWigcRwkUawvukMocx.png","name":"Programa Ibermedia","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":6647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tabasco films","origin_country":""},{"id":357,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vía Digital","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":45,"logo_path":"/tUkNOAjyTt9D56DUeQfmmAFvwYQ.png","name":"Road Movies","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2000-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Waiting List","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":20}
