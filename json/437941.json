However, in order to become a diamond, anyone, even the most outstanding brilliant, needs to be cut, and the way to the legendary stage of The Bolshoi Theatre for Yulya lies through the walls of the ballet school, where the more capricious teacher Galina Mikhailovna Beletskaya takes custody of the rebellious provincial.  Turning into a prima will require incredible self-denial, and Yulya herself will have to make sure that the big ballet is not only the whiteness of the packs, the gold of the boxes and the slip of silk ribbons. But no obstacles will stop the one who has the big dream.","popularity":4.666,"poster_path":"/osnDjnyC0VehQS5ao8AeYKcl1Ou.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marmot Film","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":102855,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valery Todorovsky Production Company","origin_country":""},{"id":102856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telekanal Rossiya","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-12-21","revenue":4029886,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bolshoi","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":43}
