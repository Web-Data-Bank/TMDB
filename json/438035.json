Joe Yule Sr. (Mickey Rooney's father) and Rene Riano are perfectly cast as nouveau riche Jiggs and Maggie, who head thataway when Maggie inherits a goldmine. As usual, Maggie spends her time trying to climb the frontier social ladder, while down-to-earth Jiggs is more interested in finding a plate of corned beef and cabbage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9uZHjwKxH8BCztuXhXqk4i4F0ny.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE RANGE is ROARING...with LAUGHTER!","title":"Jiggs and Maggie Out West","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
