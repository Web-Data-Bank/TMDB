J. Cronin's 1935 novel of the same name, about injustices in a mining community in North East England.  While the novel follows the development of three young men in the small mining town, the film focuses on just one of them; the smart David Fenwick who gets a scholarship to university, meets a girl who only marries him because her former boyfriend has abandoned her, and eventually returns to the mine town as a teacher and takes part in a futile rescue effort when the mine is flooded, trapping both his father and his younger brother.","popularity":0.976,"poster_path":"/aUmcGT0ghKBc82fXvJYypkVt2Pg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18700,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grafton Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1940-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"FROM THE PEN OF \"THE CITADEL'S\" BOLD AUTHOR!","title":"The Stars Look Down","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":19}
