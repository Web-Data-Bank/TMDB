Fifty years after the mission, which so fascinated European royalty, Julian was forced again to prove his faith, only this time before a Shogun, who wanted to force him to abandon his religion. Julian resists, as does Miguel Chijiwa, a fellow at the embassy to Rome, who become a martyr. Betrayed by Cristóvão Ferreira, who cannot bear the torture, Julian suffers an inglorious death ... or maybe not.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madragoa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1997-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eyes of Asia","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
