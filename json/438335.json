The corpses of the two masked Malian women were discovered ritually mutilated and hanging from a ceiling. The detectives' search leads them to a Malian father and his 18-year-old daughter. The father confesses to the crime, but further investigation reveals that he is lying. Even more puzzled than before, the two investigators consult a noted professor who tries to help them understand the true nature of the crime. The story is based on a book by controversial French academic Tobie Nathan, a self-proclaimed \"ethno-psychiatrist,\" who has been researching the problems experienced by France's many immigrants, particularly African ones, as they wrestle with the clash between their native beliefs and their new culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bTVwqheLNqJB25aHB2a5wEUwj1r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saraka Bo","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
