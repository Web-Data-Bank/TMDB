Hammer, who was doing a painting residency in Cassis, France, when war broke out in Kosovo, found herself questioning the validity of art in the face of political conflict and unrest. She began exploring the history of the French Resistance in Cassis, and used that as a chance to reflect on how Cassis’ artistic community, both those who were threatened by the Nazi occupation of France and those who were able to remain relatively neutral, reacted to the atrocities of the Second World War.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iuJdtNaEINU9g24B57SOhca0Xg9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resisting Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
