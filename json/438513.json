The film features two lovers who have never met in person but whose poetry over three years has subtly declared their unyielding love. Yam's minimalist acting style enables her to convey dynamic passion as well as step about the stage with ease and accomplish the image of a resolute, yet gentle, scholar. Pak meanwhile defies a prime minister with pride and dignity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qarIe05n1zrpdIYTRy2KNl3qEwq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bo Ying","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1959-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Butterfly and Red Pear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
