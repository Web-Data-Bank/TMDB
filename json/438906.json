For one, it is unclear where the rehearsal ends and the performance begins. Everson's close-ups offer a distinctly cinematic rendering of theatrical blocking, with the actors' repeated movements (a soldierâ€™s salute, a woman's carrying a lit torch) taking on heightened significance. The plot remains obscure but Everson conjures a psychological intensity comparable to Maya Deren's studies for camera. - Max Goldberg","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7SjN1NkOeskfEBNcG5OKYAthY3c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House in the North Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
