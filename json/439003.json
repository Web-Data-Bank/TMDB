Actually music full stop. Because this is a band of probably the best musicians you will ever hear. So what you get here is simply an amazing collection of excellent music from concerts all over the world as well as some videos from the time. Here you have the cheesy Knocking At Your Back Door and Bad Attitude to smokin live footage of Black Night (84) and Space truckin (85). While the dvd is mainly split evenly between the Blackmore years and Morse years, both are equally outstanding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xA89ZvmXxED5sHwJziWv9rkKyH5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thompson Music Management","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":183,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Purple: New, Live & Rare - The Video Collection 1984-2000","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
