Mexican activist Gustavo Castro, a witness to the crime, survived the horror of that night and was trapped in Honduras. The defense of the river Gualcarque, sacred to the Lenca people, against the installation of a hydroelectric plant, is the preamble of a story in which we follow Garifuna leader Miriam Miranda, friend and companion of Berta. Their struggle for decolonization is the same, in a country that is sold to transnational capital and takes lives in many ways.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":67156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oxfam","origin_country":""},{"id":83562,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terco Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":86124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tercer Piso","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berta Vive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
