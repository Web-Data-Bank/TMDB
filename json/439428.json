Soviet troops and tanks are occupying the city - random attacks, soldiers shooting, bodies lying dead on the sidewalk. With an impromptu crew, the director (Karel Roden) captures some unique evidence - material which is, however, worthless in occupied Prague; it has to be shown to the rest of the world. So, while the Soviets are concocting false reports of heartfelt receptions without military resistance for propaganda purposes, the director sets off on a risky trip across the closed Czech-Austrian border to Vienna.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yjbOSgH9bJNCtA1SO62Jq59TKnG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33214,"logo_path":null,"name":"i/o post","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":114926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jan Němec - Film","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2009-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ferrari Dino Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
