The show, filmed at Melbourne's historic Athenaeum Theatre during his sold out tour of Australia 2009, promises more memorable tales from the globe-trotting Scotsman in his finest performance yet to date. As possibly the most-traveled comedian in the world, he describes sometimes in painfully funny detail the less glamorous side of a comedian's life on the road. Sometimes introspective, occasionally outlandish, these true stories from his life are sure to leave you with a smile on your face and wanderlust in your heart. The DVD also includes a special unreleased ?Visitor?s Guide to Scotland? as well as other extras including TV Appearances, Photo Gallery and hidden features.","popularity":0.988,"poster_path":"/sQiY9P7g7xW9LqeiCxsWP0yH658.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Danny Bhoy: Live at the Athenaeum","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
