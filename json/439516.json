Upon his arrival, he was swindled of his belongings and was only left with a bottle he picked up in Saudi as a souvenir. To top it all, he discovered that his girlfriend has fallen in love with a basketball player. In his despair, he threw the bottle to the wall and from there came out a genie named Jeannie (Judy Ann Santos). And just like in fairy tales, he was entitled to three wishes.","popularity":0.809,"poster_path":"/1k0IsThcscSfjGpFSaDp7THChDj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8356,"logo_path":"/z4Rv1ryUZMaGJwcaPD5nEvpOIDq.png","name":"Viva Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2002-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeannie, Bakit Ngayon Ka Lang?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
