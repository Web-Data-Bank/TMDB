While watching these familiar faces represented in this official history, I recalled other versions of the events recorded, as well as other events that didn't get recorded but had occurred at the same time. I began to ask what else was being recorded here and whose histories were these images claiming to represent?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nursing History","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
