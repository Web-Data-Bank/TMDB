Wherever he went, amidst political upheaval, his director followed with a camera. The resulting reality cinema is the living story of a struggle for justice and human dignity, for freedom of expression, which Thai filmmakers do not have. A dark cinematic record of democracy in action, in all its farcical, obscene and heartbreaking details.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b8rhhxiUOk8uhpn0IgXBbGltvNn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2014-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Censor Must Die","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
