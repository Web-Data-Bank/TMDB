The film consists of three independent stories, all connected through the motif of a field of grain. In 'Awn' a young couple takes a summer stroll in the country, in 'The Haystack' a gang of boys have an adventure with an older girl, and 'The Journey' recounts the tragicomic homecoming of a pair of aging newlyweds. For only the second time in the nineties Czech star Iva Janzurová appeared on the silver screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pfwDTfZk7g8HYI9G9UPwfdilK6W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"1998-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Co chytneš v žitě","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
