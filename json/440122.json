The second part manipulates time, a wordless portrait of clay vessels being produced in Morocco that slows down and speeds up without warning, imbuing unspectacular actions with detachment and wonder. The third part distorts space, a hand camera tour that moves through apparently connected locations as if carrying out a single movement, although these industrial facilities, cityscapes, meadows and exhibition spaces are not side by side but scattered across the globe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ng7uLiUr2k0bjhPrH0ZTGtAMqR4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2017-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Theatre of Disappearance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
