She wields her uniform, beret and black handbag like a protective shield, which her daily work desperately requires. More or less on her own, she runs a small police unit dedicated to protecting women who’ve been raped and children who’ve suffered abuse in the war-plagued regions of the Congo. At the start of Maman Colonelle, she’s transferred from Bukavu to Kisangani, arriving only to discover her future home and office in a desolate state. While she deals with such practical obstacles with suitable feistiness, the traumas and social deformities of the people around her have nightmarish dimensions: the envy surrounding those with state-recognised ‘victim’ status, hope for help from the ‘whites’, depression, helplessness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xh0vy7BeMlGFUAvwcwNGUWfqfHw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mama Colonel","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":8}
