I shot it over the Easter vacation in 1980 on 16mm, black-and-white reversal film. Apart from two five-minute exercises, it was destined to be the only film I ever finished at the College of Film and Television of the German Democratic Republic (Hochschule für Film und Fernsehen der DDR, HFF) in East Germany’s Potsdam-Babelsberg. It was quickly banned from being shown publicly and it remained in storage until the end of 1989. The film tells the story of a mother and her sons having coffee and cake while they try to remember –in vain– when the first time was that they tangled with the police. The reason it was banned was the casual way the film portrayed those young men living their lives untouched by ideology, including taking their careers as petty criminals for granted, meaning the film’s author accepted their existence, as is, and simply wanted to explore it.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":665,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film (HFF)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Why Make a Film About These People?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
