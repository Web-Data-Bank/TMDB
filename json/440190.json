Trotter waged a battle against D.W. Griffithâ€™s technically groundbreaking but notoriously Ku Klux Klan-friendly The Birth of a Nation, unleashing a fight that still rages today about race relations, media representation, and the power and influence of Hollywood. Birth of a Movement, based on Dick Lehr's book The Birth of a Movement: How Birth of a Nation Ignited the Battle for Civil Rights, captures the backdrop to this prescient clash between human rights, freedom of speech, and a changing media landscape.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/vcRmIkyAKC7ZEQOioR8pPHdIRzC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Battle Against America's First Blockbuster","title":"Birth of a Movement","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
