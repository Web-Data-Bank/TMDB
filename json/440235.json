He should have become a professional soldier. Married with two daughters, Bernd went into big industry, became a laborer and is still as needed today as a foreman at Raffinerie AG Schwedt (Oder) as he once was at VEB Petrolchemisches Kombinat in the days of the GDR. Much has changed in his life, but what has remained is the work in three shifts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uaNcJzT1bo9UqtAwu5ddwTFNbNR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eigentlich wollte ich Förster werden - Bernd aus Golzow","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
