Police pleaded that they were ‘terrorists’ and were so heavily-armed that arrest was impossible, They say that they had no option but to kill them all. A witness, however, sees a man shot with his hands up in the act of surrendering. This fact led to the extraordinary unravelling of the real truth ten years later by investigators of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission. The journey of this film is as gripping and shocking as any detective story – and unfolds in that genre. The event distils a period when South Africa was chillingly close to a major civil war. Its universal message reveals with shocking reality what happens when power corrupts political systems and assassinates its opponents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Guguletu Seven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
