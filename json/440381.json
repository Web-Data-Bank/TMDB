Experienced mountaineer Lincoln Hall was invited to join an expedition as a high altitude cameraman. It was his second attempt to summit the mountain, having turned back just short 22 years earlier. Shortly after reaching the summit, Hall began to behave irrationally, suffering from lack of oxygen. Aided by his loyal Sherpas for over 9 hours, he eventually collapsed and they declared him dead. His family were informed and the news hit headlines. But something happened that night that science cannot explain. The next morning Lincoln Hall was found alive by approaching climbers and his dramatic rescue began. Never before has a man been declared dead so high on Everest and survived. This is the remarkable true story of Lincoln Hallâ€™s extraordinary journey back from beyond.","popularity":1.61,"poster_path":"/5TWxWF8I75teVnXJn48XLLHlNBF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6747,"logo_path":"/uLTkpA3dpMrGwBIDin8OByW39gQ.png","name":"Essential Media and Entertainment","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2008-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One man's journey back from beyond","title":"Miracle on Everest","video":false,"vote_average":3.758,"vote_count":31}
