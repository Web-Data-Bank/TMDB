As she performs, her mirror image gradually assumes an autonomous identity so that what was a central relationship of self to self has become one self to other. Focii not only explores the construction of self, and the dynamics of self and other, but also the interaction between the viewerâ€™s body and the body onscreen, raising questions on the nature of identification in cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aGbgQqTKRvAde6SFFo4ZxgTBIQ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Focii","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
