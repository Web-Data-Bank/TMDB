Fortuitously stumbling into the hideaways, brash young miner Takezo (Matsumoto Jun) and his bumbling sidekick Shinhachi (Miyagawa Daiuske) hatch a daring plan to help transport the gold out of enemy terrain - in exchange for a share of the stash, of course. With assassins hot in pursuit, Yuki disguises as a male and ventures into the real world with Rukurota and her peasant companions, getting her first taste of danger, toil, and budding romance with the strong-minded and willful Takezo.","popularity":1.699,"poster_path":"/7InHi5EsxYP4wsf7BSI9uBFtSY1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yomiuri Shimbun Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":11727,"logo_path":"/cIMyE9cw1W4kMFGxmC17HKTnVz9.png","name":"Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":33677,"logo_path":"/85U2onICiQV9fMHORxw8EWSQ6MZ.png","name":"Chukyo TV Broadcasting Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":4331,"logo_path":"/z3oDy8Sgn2EYN9Q1IZ6O26uv65b.png","name":"J Storm","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":9149,"logo_path":"/isLUpud9N56ifftJZ4XvzwBBpoG.png","name":"Shogakukan","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":882,"logo_path":"/iDw9Xxok1d9WAM2zFicI8p3khTH.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":1778,"logo_path":"/b5rT6VbYza3LyfltCmz1OcqzWJM.png","name":"dentsu","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":6755,"logo_path":"/c0ENH8QeZLvCACpzCpwvYMy2SDr.png","name":"Nippon Television Network Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Princess","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":11}
