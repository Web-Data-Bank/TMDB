Only one year earlier, not even the boldest observer would have dared predict such a possibility. After one hundred days of digging, the earth reveals its secret: the first remains appear. The documentary reconstructs the process that cuts the countryâ€™s history in two: before and after.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":86321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aceituna Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2010-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las manos en la tierra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
