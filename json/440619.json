Ray and Sunshine perform a high spirited acrobatic routine, demonstrating both their strength and flexibility. Chaz Chase then performs a comic routine, demonstrating what one can consume besides traditional foods. Next, The Holman Sisters, sitting back-to-back, perform a fast paced two-piano duet, each often playing both pianos at the same time.
