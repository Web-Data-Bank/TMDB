Burke decides to ask Higgins to close his business on Sunday, but Higgins only concern is to find a baritone to sing in the saloon's quartet, and has his henchies toss Ted out into the street. Ted decides to fight fire with fire, so he gathers up the down-and-out vaudeville act of Chase &amp; Chase (who don't take long to show why they are down and out) and knife-thrower Steve Clemente, and a dozen or so western musicians from Gower Gulch as the before-the-sermon at his tabernacle. Higgins sends his rowdies over to bust up the Sunday morning competition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1936-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sunday Round-Up","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
