He's working on a documentary, for Japanese TV, on Iranian burial practices. On the anniversary of his wife's death, a hitchhiker tells him a story of spousal abuse and infant mortality, he discovers that someone has been buried in his plot next to his wife, and he needs the help of his attorney, a well-connected fixer. He dreams of death, even as he investigates it for his film. His niece's husband, a well-known writer, fails to return home; he searches hospitals for an unclaimed body. His heart disease is flaring up. Is he prepared for death? Is that all that's left?","popularity":0.727,"poster_path":"/aivJzIL4haQKBYPVYylyHwH2AwU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hedayat Film","origin_country":"IR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2000-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
