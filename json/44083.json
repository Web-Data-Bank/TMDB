Feeble-minded Reza works at a bridal shop where he transports wedding dresses on his old, rickety bicycle. Reza spends his time communing with his long-dead mother at the cemetery, or with a dress mannequin in the shop window. One day, not long after the mannequin loses its head, Reza's life changes when a beautiful woman, accompanied by her maid, arrives at the store looking for bridal veils.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/NlCpuNJqN5sd4TJ2EiU8sSpJTd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2002-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
