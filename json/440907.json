It captures David Hockney's return to England after 25 years in California. As he approaches the age of 70, he decides to re-invent his painting from scratch, working through the seasons and in all weathers out in the Yorkshire countryside - ending up with the largest picture ever made outdoors. It is at once the story of a homecoming and an intimate portrait of what inspires and motivates today's greatest living British-born artist as time runs out.  Winner of Best Essay award at the International Festival for Films on Art in Montreal and nominated Best Arts Documentary by the Grierson and International Emmy Awards. Premiered on BBC1, the documentary appears in a special extended 60' version.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":86380,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coluga Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David Hockney: A Bigger Picture","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
