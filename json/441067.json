They had separated a while ago because their ideas of marriage were completely disparate: The conservative Fred advocated the womanâ€²s role of wife and mother, while Helga dreamt about an emancipated partnership between two employed persons. Now, her sister has brought them back together. At first sight, Fred seems to have changed and, once again, Helga cannot resist his advances. But when she meets with difficulties during a fair in Tashkent, Fred yet again proves to be a petty bourgeois by assuring her that they would get along perfectly without her working.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/25t2Q1tSEstXBaDzAkhz5kyC8NE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1972-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laut und leise ist die Liebe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
