Highlighting the links between being sexually abused as a child, loss of self-esteem, and turning to the streets, the film quickly dispels the images of glamor and big money usually associated with prostitution, and shows the positive efforts of child-care workers to help juvenile prostitutes find a way out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ni9eV3fUwZkMbO01aguGaqDTwux.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Street Kids","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
