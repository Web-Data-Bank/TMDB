It’s Guy’s last chance to relive his glory days and finally lay down his guns. The oddball relationship between David and Guy is the central drive of the film as the director explores the ethics of big game hunting and questions his own animal rights stance when lured in by the thrill of the hunt. THE END OF THE GAME is a compelling character study of a bizarre eccentric undertaking his last big game hunt in Africa.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/548jOtMJxp0vhQOx0U4uwzVNT23.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13788,"logo_path":"/dNLCLFvMac9l8xIBhKOyJKfef7u.png","name":"Hopscotch Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8087,"logo_path":"/54EcBNvIolJDr4OHFACvTHJK2Q0.png","name":"Creative Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of the Game","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
