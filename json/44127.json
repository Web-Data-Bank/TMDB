Songs About Jane finally entered the Billboard Top Ten in August 2004, more than two years after the album's release, and follow-up singles like \"She Will Be Loved\" and \"Sunday Morning\" helped the album move over 2.7 million copies by year's end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gIDME4teQG4z1B5M1WeRd7omXyf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maroon 5: Live From Le Cabaret De Montreal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
