Harris jumps at the chance when the young man invites him to come to the small town to film a talent show. At the show, the man dons a blond wig and performs in drag as Olivia Newton John. Harris captures it all on tape: A portrait of a true outsider. Harris shot a dramatic piece, \"Beaver Kid 2\" based on the documentary; This interpretation of the story, made in 1981 on a home video camera with a budget of $100, features a young Sean Penn as \"the Beaver Kid\". Still possessed, Harris then rewrote the script, cast up-and-comer Crispin Glover in the lead, and created the final segment, \"The Orkly Kid\", with funding from the American Film Institute. The trilogy unveils the inner world of a fantastic character in three incarnations.","popularity":2.303,"poster_path":"/zdKOqEM3yGOq8dhXATD6qcZTHWu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beaver Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":6.625,"vote_count":20}
