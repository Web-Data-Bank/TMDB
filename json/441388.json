Half innovation, half invention, Issey's use of pleats and twists has opened up a whole new world of possibilities in fabric by exploiting texture and wrinkles. The process of folding and twisting the fabrics by hand, then baking them, is captured on film. Miyake talks about his background, training, and some of his favorite projects, such as designing costumes for William Forsythe's Frankfurt Ballet and outfits for Lithuania's 1992 Olympic team.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/mc0gtQOT73VYNxXfb9vW1WinSWL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Issey Miyake Moves","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
