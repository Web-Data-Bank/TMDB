But of all the speeches he's given, six in particular may define his legacy as, in historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's words, \"one of the best writers and orators in the presidency.\" Interviews with eminent historians and key figures in his writing process give rare insights into these iconic speeches, as well as the Obama presidency and the man himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8UeaCgpU3HKaJYPVGUORj6ARCoy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Obama Years: The Power of Words","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
