No one has a monopoly on truth, and in Tombstone Rashomon, the truth is shared by six conflicting, yet historical perspectives. In doing so, the filmâ€™s narrative becomes prismatic and the result is perhaps the most comprehensive telling of the most important gunfight in American history. This is the Tombstone story told in the style of the Japanese classic Rashomon where we see history from several perspectives including that of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Kate, Ike Clanton, Colonel Hafford and Johnny Behan.","popularity":2.986,"poster_path":"/yh0r0HlcpAgZFj17ngLgOEBaUHM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31193,"logo_path":"/lHEJvwMDCmgDtfcKUZsvdi3KA5V.png","name":"Running Wild Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tombstone Rashomon","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":3}
