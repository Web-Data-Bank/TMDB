It was the genocide of 800'000 people in 1994, however, that led to a rethinking of development aid. The film offers those involved at that time a chance to speak, as well as examining further the question of whether doing good always does good.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Came to Help","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
