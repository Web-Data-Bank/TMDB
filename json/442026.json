In six months, the community that had been their home for generations would be demolished. DISLOCATION chronicles the lives of tenants in one building as they move through the six-month relocation process. The filmmakers follow three families as they prepare for their own move and as they help others around them. Dislocation is a story of a community coping with its own impending demise. It is a tale of courage, hope, and survival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":50946,"logo_path":"/1lTs6kx4LNc48mypKt9F0y5X3XH.png","name":"WTTW/Chicago","origin_country":"US"},{"id":86617,"logo_path":"/xoh9vGYbYdloJh2IwMO1pczA9ab.png","name":"Genco Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dislocation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
