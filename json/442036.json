Medical photographs of internal organs and images of the moon's surface create landscapes of inner and outer space. This haunting rumination suggests the disparity between medical interpretations and personal experiences of physicality and mortality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strange Space","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
