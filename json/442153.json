A lot of claims were made against him. The demands for amendments and endless additions and rewrites by the authors lasted for about a year. The original version of the title \"Na pokhony!\" (\"To bow down!\") was replaced by \"To Dream and to Live\". According to Pylyp Ilyenko, the director's eldest son, this name appeared \"as a result of censor pressure.\" Censorship stopped the tape 40 times: at the stage of the literary script, director's, during film tests (the actors were not approved), filming, etc. The film catastrophically fell apart into fragments, into masterfully filmed, but unrelated scenes. The director called the finished version a \"dead film\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hufhio8QnTLSvKwzKrd17IpsLm9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Dream and to Live","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
