This hits home with Bodén, who was prompted to her research here by a conversation in which her sister declared, “I don’t think I’m worth more than Jämtland.” After her initial dismissiveness of her sister’s statement, she started to second-guess the conversation and her own ingrained notions of what it meant. This film is about Bodén’s search for understanding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sC9xspeFtEvLHvsOOf0UBozElJU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poczta","origin_country":""},{"id":111558,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vapen och Dramatik AB","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apt. + Car + All I Have and Own","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
