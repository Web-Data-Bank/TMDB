In 1966, Ceaucescu issued Decree 770, in which he forbade abortion for all women unless they were over forty or were already taking care of four children.  All forms of contraception were totally banned. The New Romanian Man was born. By 1969, the country had a million babies more than the previous average.  Romanian society was rapidly changing. By using very interesting archival footage and excerpts from old fiction films and by interviewing famous personalities from that time – gynecologists or mothers who were part of the new society - the director revives this period of tremendous oppression of personal freedom.  Many deaths were caused by the mere fact that women, including wives of secret Romanian agents, famous TV presenters, and actresses, had to undergo illegal abortions. Many women were jailed for having them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c68xWkwMINBTywOpgsT2OClZvlW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":73926,"logo_path":"/fQtClxlHLBnPdlV5HBPi0Tzj38d.png","name":"Televiziunea Română","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":20782,"logo_path":null,"name":"WestEnd Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":71160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pro TV Produktion GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of the Decree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
