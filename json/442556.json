Deeply influenced by abstract expressionism and classical music, Vera Klement’s painterly impasto canvas depicts isolated and alienated objects in a white, solid void. In this film, Klement creates a portrait of an artist under oppression, an homage to Russian composer, Dmitri Shostakovitch. Interweaving the artist’s process with her 80th birthday party, the documentary celebrates the artist’s life and her unyielding attempt to create.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Blunt Edge","title":"Vera Klement","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
