Based on a compilation of O’Carroll’s own experiences as a wedding videographer back in the day, the film is a buddy movie slash crime capper with the good guys coming out on top at the end, but not without the sense that the entire thing could go up in flames every other minute. Murphy and Bermingham have great chemistry that has you rooting for them from beginning to end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6wWGA0IpDdQVejeyAZiDGHNk8gH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burnt Ice Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":170460,"logo_path":null,"name":"ORion Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2016-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shooting wedding videos can be murder","title":"Dead Along the Way","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
