Sexual fantasies are embodied in black-and-white images of androgenic bodies.  The boundary between images of reality and desire images becomes permeable, gender is subjected to playful transformations.  \"Between\" relies on lusty fragmentation of the body, surreal sequence of sequences, and an ambivalent symbolism.  The desire for a self-titled production of the body dominated the zeitgeist of the 80s.  The articulation of a wild \"desire\" - to catch up with a central concept of the aesthetic as well as feminist discussion of the 1980s - was also reflected in films which in the series of Maya Derens films of the 1940s formulated another feminine view.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
