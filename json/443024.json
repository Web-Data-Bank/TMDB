Most of the houses standing there are illegal constructions, quickly erected for a life alongside the road.  Karam Ghossein, who also works as a cameraman for other video artists from Lebanon, combines pictures from a commissioned production he shot on the occasion of a friend’s wedding in 2004 with street impressions from the present day. Past events can’t be told apart from the observations of today: a kaleidoscope of stories that take place on this highway.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3cGBfEv8vBvnAI5Vyw94dAjeIaA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Friendly Fire Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2017-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Street of Death","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
