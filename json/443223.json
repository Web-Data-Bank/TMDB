Alienated from themselves and wondering why 'it isn't exactly trendy to be Jewish', Estelle and Lily meet each other and explore their Jewishness.  They explore the stories of a mother and daughter in fifties Britain, a refugee from Vienna, and Israeli Iranian storyteller, a neurotic father, a Trinidadian woman, and finally the two women end up on a roof looking at Israel.  Rootless Cosmopolitans mixes music, family and food to take a wry look at the myth of the Jewish princess and asks 'What is a Jew?'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q5IZBjFM31NGanxol7htKeyD2AK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rootless cosmopolitans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
