Every image is marked and cancelled before it disappears. Even the emulsion of the film is treated with acid showing its fragility. The film is a highly effective compilation of image, colour and sound building upon each other, slowly heightening the sense of urgency.  Against this mood there is a reassuring image of a silhouetted woman working at the film projector. A strong, competent, fearless woman. Woman documenting, warning, saving.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/2CuFxCkPH1HnFsyFDIkjjIXqVzy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endangered","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
