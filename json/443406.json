Iranian auter Armon Mahdavi ventures into the true nature of adolesence through his masterpiece of self-discovery, societal critique, and epistomological questioning. \"Youth in a Cage\" forces us to reconsider everything we think we know about life and love, and reminds us that one's true meaning can be found though simple human acts, such as using the restroom or sitting in front of a computer. Highly appraised by Hungarian filmmaker BÃ©la Tarr as the greatest film of all time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE ONE FILM INFAMOUSLY REJECTED FROM CANNES' OFFICIAL SELECTION BECAUSE IT WAS \"TOO GOOD\"","title":"Youth in a Cage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
