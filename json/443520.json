As the film opens, Tong ventures into China to hunt down a band of villainous drug traffickers. Though she has been reluctantly paired up with her Mainland counterpart Chiang Hung (Sibelle Hu Hui-chung), Tong prefers to work alone, traveling incognito as a camera-happy tourist. Chiang dutifully tails her erstwhile partner, eventually saving her life from a high-kicking assassination attempt. Later, when the baddies catch up with Chiang and her, leaving her for dead, Tong saves her partner and agrees to hunt down these black-hearted villains together. Cult 1970s kung-fu star Carter Wong also makes an appearance in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ucUi6jwQQ1O4smgwIP2wD4XOk8o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1992-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way Of The Lady Boxers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
