Sheathed in orange, red, brown, blue, white, black and sometimes shimmering like a diamond, Mt. Fuji shows her many faces, which change with the time of day, season and weather.

Fuji as you never have before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bXvmdwIOmEK0UcgH4CLeZFcsMdL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11376,"logo_path":"/lrglrxyGOMRl9KCsmcjmzjjpT2H.png","name":"NHK Enterprises","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mt.
