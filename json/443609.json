The documentary, filmed in the Lavalle drylands and the Andean foothills, observes several characters and their jobs related to the most arid areas of the province of Mendoza: a pilot who enters the summer storms, bombarding the clouds with silver iodide to prevent hail from damaging crops; a fisherman from the Nihuil lagoon who barely survives in a polluted dam; a family of wells who build cisterns and irrigation wells in rural desert areas; and a geographer in search of Francisco de Hoces's journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radiografía del desierto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
