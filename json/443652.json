Wielding his now familiar formula of flashy special effects, MTV-style camera work, and brooding art direction, Ninn throws in a bit of uncharacteristic slapstick and cartoon-style humor to create a whole new chapter in one of the most popular adult series ever made. With a plot too weird to describe here, NWH5 is a surreal saga populated by clowns and Japanese businessmen, talking televisions and mad scientists, monks and pimps, and other additions of the Ninn psyche.","popularity":0.753,"poster_path":"/x2iCM6zhUGos5wEEZVruNP89xRB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5097,"logo_path":"/cjK2zkmtR2DxHcwqRCXr5SpsLSa.png","name":"VCA Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Next Generation","title":"New Wave Hookers 5","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
