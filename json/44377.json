The narration then examines the nation's colonial history, beginning with the first German missionary in 1901, the establishment of schools, French occupation following World War I, the paucity of books written by and published by Cameroonians, and the repression of the CPU, a leftist organization of the 1950s and 1960s. Cameroon and its people are the lark, its feathers plucked first by colonialism and then by native strongmen: 'Alouette, je te plumerai.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bYWIn1wjOv4GAhbekZmkhk0qB2z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":38153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Raphia","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Africa, I Will Fleece You","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":7}
