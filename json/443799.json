Benson, hall-of-fame catcher and current manager of the three-time world champion San Francisco Titans baseball team, has had enough. A.J.'s sexuality has been the subject of public speculation for years, but the tabloids have recently raised the rumors to a fever pitch. Encouraged by his close friend and batting coach Dave Decker, A.J. decides to come out and put the rumors to rest. The former Olympian is reluctant at first, but he soon realizes that his openness could help gay, lesbian, and transgender athletes everywhere. His revelation, broadcast live on national television with the help of his former-teammate-turned-sportscaster Jim Weaver, has immediate repercussions - not just for his colleagues and fans, but for A.J. himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zKGHtpjdjW9qYtQUaudzERYShL7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6712,"logo_path":"/9vdfii5jwt5EVU5fMghWeME31J1.png","name":"Titan Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out!","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
