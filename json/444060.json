Held for years in debt bondage in illegal Thai brothels, they suffer extreme abuse by pimps, clients, and the police.  The trafficking of Burmese girls has soared in recent years as a direct result of political repression in Burma. Human rights abuses, war and ethnic discrimination has displaced hundreds of thousands of families, leaving families with no means of livelihood. An offer of employment in Thailand is a rare chance for many families to escape extreme poverty.  Sacrifice examines the social, cultural, and economic forces at work in the trafficking of Burmese girls into prostitution in Thailand. It is the story of the valuation and sale of human beings, and the efforts of teenage girls to survive a personal crisis born of economic and political repression.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of Child Prostitutes from Burma","title":"Sacrifice: The Story of Child Prostitutes in Burma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
