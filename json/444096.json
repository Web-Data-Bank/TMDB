Barry plays Jim Randall, a lawman assigned to investigate a series of gold shipment robberies. Arriving in the middle of a hold-up, Randall finds himself accused of killing the driver (Yakima Canutt). Wells Fargo agent Cal Chambers (Milton Kibbee) vouches for his innocence, however, claiming him to be a noted geologist. Along with several of the prospectors, Jim devises a plan to prove that Jud Parker (Harry Worth) is using his dummy mine as a cover for stealing ore.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/fRA04okAfLn9zZYoroMO2T3ZgYG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1941-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kansas Cyclone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
