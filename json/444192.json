Though Elliot is billed first, the plot and action are evenly divided between the two B-picture favorites. The story takes place in Kansas, just after the Civil War. Wild Bill Hickok (Elliot) is summoned from Dodge City to Abilene, there to neutralize a crooked political machine. Hickok is aided every step of the way by Tex Rawlings (Ritter), a seemingly harmless drifter who is appointed sheriff after proving his prowess with his six-guns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5pxaen1ASouNh86pNEu3UKesr3U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Your two favorite action stars in song-studded adventures!","title":"King of Dodge City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
