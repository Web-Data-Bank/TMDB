The final moments of the final game have become one of the most controversial events in Olympic history. With play tied, the score table horn sounded during a second free throw attempt that put the U.S. ahead by one. But the Soviets claimed they had called for a time out before the basket and confusion ensued. The clock was set back by three seconds twice in a row and the Russians finally prevailed at the very last. The U.S. protested, but a jury decided in the USSR’s favor and Team USA voted unanimously to refuse its silver medals. The Soviet players have been treated as heroes at home.","popularity":7.955,"poster_path":"/g7dr7pC2JYOBi3heCudlI5Ec5jY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76049,"logo_path":"/tam9pIV4QK1ZPwdxBgtVkK1WTYC.png","name":"Cinema Fund","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":69587,"logo_path":"/u0Jy8wJ05m3MZCNiba1EXgf0zoK.png","name":"Russia-1","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":3467,"logo_path":"/pumbDNR4udEagb3ldNUMFSA85Fn.png","name":"Studio Trite","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-12-28","revenue":51169464,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Seconds","video":false,"vote_average":7.304,"vote_count":130}
