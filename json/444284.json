To test it, Betty's father zaps Charley hoping his newly-aberrant behavior will cause Betty to end her affections for the milquetoast. Dad's plan backfires: the invention works perfectly, Charley gets a backbone, and Betty loves her new forceful man. However, Charley's courage and lack of a superego get him in trouble with the law. He goes on trial for assaulting a bullying police officer. Is Charley going up the river leaving Betty high and dry?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x2zivmH6gjBTwVoJPSOUahnoMGb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Wild Idea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
