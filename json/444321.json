The story takes places just after the Civil War, with hostilities between Yanks and Rebels still in effect between Kansas and Texas. The villain, cattle rustler Vic Landreau (Paul Sutton), intends to play both factions down the middle for his own benefit. But Landreau meets his match in the form of wandering do-gooder Jud Calvert (Charles Starrett).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ItuDDja2dxrJ2hMxYBRI9CInCG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Smashing The West's Most Ruthless Cattle-Rustlin' Cut-Throats!","title":"The Pinto Kid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
