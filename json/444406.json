When the local Aboriginal people discovered his plight, they took him under their wing so he grew up as a sort of wild man, completely able to live off the land. He was known as the \"Robin Hood\" of the West because he hunted game on Federal land which was very illegal and gave the meat to the poor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1cuzL3Lj72rlFXbDEAWPVzzA8bv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Patterson Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Man Alone Is an Army","title":"The Legend of Earl Durand","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
