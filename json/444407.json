A strange presence enters the house where he lived, recreates his studio, breathes his surroundings and travels the landscape until he merges with his own paintings, pure oil painting that takes the form of a mysterious and unattainable dream like the great Dutch teacher.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cV1ws5xZ6eeS4Ejand2CFgI3n9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111463,"logo_path":null,"name":"DocNomads","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2017-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Vincent’s House in the Borinage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
