These are only words, and words alone can t do justice to the  phenomenon that is Ghostland Observatory. Experience the inferno of this band s live shows and you ll start to get it. As one pundit quipped, It s tough to believe just two dudes create this monstrosity of sound! Two small-town Texas dudes with very distinct personalities: producer/drummer Thomas Turner, heavily influenced by electronic artists from Daft Punk to Green Velvet and rockers like The Clash, and front man Aaron Behrens, who was singing Jerry Lee Lewis Great Balls of Fire when he was 9 and whose charisma inspires comparisons to Freddie Mercury and Prince.  This is their national television debut, recorded July 10, 2007. Ghostland Observatory has created a sound that blends buoyant electronics, drums, hyper driven guitar and ecstatic vocals - dance music that rocks, and rock music with soul. Maybe the best word to describe that sound is BALLSY.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live from Austin TX","title":"Ghostland Observatory: Austin City Limits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
