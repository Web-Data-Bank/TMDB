Omar is in love with Yacine, a pretty, intelligent girl from a wealthy family. He decides to pen her a love letter, which ends up causing misunderstanding and a rift between him and his childhood love. Meanwhile, Demba falls in love with a beggar and they share 'secret' stares and tender touches in brief meetings each time. All the children seek advice from their mentor, who sells bicycle-rides at the beach-front. The innocence of childhood infatuation is cleverly layered over a troubled Senegal laboring under the strains of strike action and economic upheaval.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uNvl9rLW1jmZZrC4y300TeHHBh7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22029,"logo_path":"/asH5UhhC8dRUUExZKIis0Y3dyjy.png","name":"Canal+ Horizons","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":87237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions du Lion Rouge","origin_country":""},{"id":36252,"logo_path":"/xHIIkI4AXFHrz8jiUzcQtd6dt6W.png","name":"Centre Cinématographique Marocain (CCM)","origin_country":"MA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"},{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un amour d'enfant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
