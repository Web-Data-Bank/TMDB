The film is inspired by three distinct periods of Simmons’s photographic work: vintage hand puppets, ventriloquist dummies and walking objects enact tales of ambition, disappointment, love, loss, and regret. Working with composer Michael Rohaytn (\"Personal Velocity\") and cameraman Ed Lachman (\"The Virgin Suicides\" and \"Far From Heaven\"), Simmons’s puppets come to life in miniature domestic scenes that echo real life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/krXrHFghlSyO06j7McLVh8Scdk6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Double Wide Media","origin_country":""},{"id":134555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Performa","origin_country":""},{"id":134556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salon 94","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Music of Regret","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
