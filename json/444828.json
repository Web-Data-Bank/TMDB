The film takes a journey with today's youth who spend their days and nights transmitting from tower blocks and warehouses; with nostalgic, experienced ex-pirates who have lost their battles with Ofcom and paid the price; and with mainstream stars who owe their fame and fortune today to their early start in pirate radio. Through unprecedented access to the secret lives of pirates, we are offered the opportunity to ask why these individuals take such enormous risks for illegal broadcasting. The stories told by key characters provide insight into the poignant affect pirate radio has had on their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tQGf58uHmGMrvzXX4iiX9QTAnbT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drowned City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
