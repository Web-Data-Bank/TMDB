In his mid-30s, Waters picked up his first electric guitar and began to revolutionize popular music. With the mix of his southern roots and gritty urban life, Waters pioneered a new form of the Blues. This program features footage from a 1971 West Coast tour, and features the songs \"Long Distance Call,\" \"Mannish Boy,\" \"Got My Mojo Working,\" and many more.  Rolling his eyes toward heaven and shaking his head like a man possessed, Muddy Waters cast a powerful spell. His high cheekbones and Oriental eyes gave him a certain Eastern, inscrutable quality, and at times his face even became angelic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cY7xiIQITmLqePNfNHORxKfp9ZF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muddy Waters - In Concert 1971","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
