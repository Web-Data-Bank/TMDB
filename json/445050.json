The result of a two-year-long investigation, the documentary names the officers who ordered attacks on villages in the area around the town of Pec during the 1999 war and those who were involved in the removal of victimsâ€™ bodies to mass graves at the Batajnica police centre near Belgrade in Serbia.  Sixteen years after they committed the crimes, they live peacefully in the Serbian capital, and despite the evidence that exists, they have not been prosecuted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kpaOSjpIGCWoHJGOyY97jrTTnvT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balkan Investigative Reporting Network","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"}],"release_date":"2015-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Their battle was a crime.
