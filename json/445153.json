Born in the underground of San Francisco in the 1980s, the festival became the largest counter- cultural event in North America. It is unique in that it is created by the people who come to the event, the participants, not the organizers, and in that sense it has survived its original ideals/utopias, but the ideas have been eroded by time, pressure from the larger society. The film is a look at this necessary evolution and expansion and questions our ability to stand behind those ideals over a lifetime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"30 years of history of Burning Man","title":"Dust & Illusions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
