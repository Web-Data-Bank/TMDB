Greed is embodied by Carlos Maldonato, \"El Canuto,\" who attempts to buy all of the shellfish for a Japanese company, and by a traveling band of prostitutes that accompany the influx of fishermen. El Canuto also wrangles to get into good stead with an old flame, Sonia, who is now the proprietor of \"La Pincoya,\" a local restaurant. But \"el loco\" proves more effective, and more damaging, than anyone could have guessed.","popularity":1.087,"poster_path":"/pzNjQ3BmevZL9RAttLMp48ocrWy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59460,"logo_path":"/bVx3FFeLnkV3jEuMcq5SRd0KBvm.png","name":"Paraíso Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tequila Gang","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":5084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Altavista Films","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":49,"logo_path":"/xpf5iHdvvBtsH8jBMlgIJHAET0c.png","name":"El Deseo","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":9335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ España","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":75690,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondart","origin_country":""},{"id":19026,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corfo","origin_country":""},{"id":101899,"logo_path":"/uYXcaPqt7hltiXLjZgJSaPQ9SNO.png","name":"Invercine\u0026Wood","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2001-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loco Fever","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7}
