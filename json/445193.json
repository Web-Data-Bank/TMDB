When villainous lumberman Frenchy Duvalle refuses to limit his wood-chopping activities, he inadvertently touches off a forest fire. Trapped in the middle of the conflagration, Frenchy's only hope for rescue is mountie Tom Jeffries, presently scouring the countryside in his scout plane. Jeffries' reasons for bringing Frenchy out safely are twofold: he must deliver the renegade lumberjack to the authorities, and he happens to be in love with Frenchy's sister Betty.","popularity":0.836,"poster_path":"/6aMlij14wPtSvsyOyman8Gqn0yw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A DOUBLE-STARRED OUTDOOR SHOW...OUTDOING ALL OTHERS FOR ACTION, DRAMA AND THRILLS","title":"The Royal Mounted Patrol","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
