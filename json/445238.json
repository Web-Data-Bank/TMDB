Acting as narrator and guide, Wilkerson spins a strange, frightening tale, incorporating scenes from TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, the music of Janelle Monáe and Phil Ochs, and the story of Rosa Parks’ investigation into the Recy Taylor case, as well as his own family history, for a gripping investigation into our collective past and its echoes into the present day.","popularity":1.506,"poster_path":"/eBijhVV9471XdxlYZjNWeyXNlT9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canada Council for the Arts","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":117716,"logo_path":"/nX1tHcNBeDW71P16HYgNfAFgy1C.png","name":"Creative Capital","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":10}
