Impressionistic scenes present the protagonist in various situations: when he has to deal with everyday chores, when he jumps into water, skis and draws. Even the simplest activity requires struggle, resilience and outstanding fitness from him. Many takes are in slow motion, contemplating the smallest detail, which the director is so skilfully able to bring out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rrXEjZe9d60PCW5HuxKJje4JE3t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28181,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wytwórnia Filmów Oswiatowych","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1983-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Few Stories About a Man","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
