In time, the couple gets married and come to have a son, Rafael. However, they soon divorce because of Luis's many commitments as a singer. This strains the relationship between Luis and Maria, so much so that Maria, stung by bitterness, teaches her son to despise his father and manages to move from Mexico to the United States to keep Luis from contacting his son. Luis wants nothing more than to regain his lost relationship and affection with his beloved son.
