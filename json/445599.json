This film thus allows us to hear with pleasure words that break with cultural gossip, that question and throw light – a verb, a man that resist here and now. We learn a great deal from it, whether or not we are familiar with Straub-Huillet’s work. Tell Me Something tells us a story, or stories. Stories about cinema, stories about faithfulness and honesty. The story, also, of the setting up of a people rising against ruling state of things. The story, moreover, of an irreparable absence – that of Danièle Huillet. In short, the story of a filmmaker in winter, and of an international community that is enlightened in the darkness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":87451,"logo_path":null,"name":"AL Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":87450,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Maison du doc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell Me Something","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
