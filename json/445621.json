In a first section, amongst shots of clouds, swirls and darkness, it referred to the origin of life. (...) After the launch of a rocket and images about exploring space, the film shows a woman naked in the country. The camera makes a slow tilt down of her body. When passing by the pubis, the camera follows a drop of blood that slides by the leg. When it reaches the floor, a parade of miniature war tanks appear, red, like the ones previously shown. The film ends with a sign that says 'But you can also give birth to nothing'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/teB3Pxn94fsYBuqAiQghkt9sJDL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1972-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La segunda primera matriz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
