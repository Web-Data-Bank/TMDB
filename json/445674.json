Court Chalu Aahe","overview":"A political and social satire on middle-class society's hypocrisy. A group of teachers plan to stage a play in a village. When a cast-member does not show up, a local stagehand is asked to replace him. An improvised, free-flowing 'rehearsal' is arranged and a mock trial is staged to help the novice understand court procedures. A (mock) charge of infanticide is levelled against Miss Benare, another cast-member. Suddenly the pretend-play turns into an accusatory game when it emerges from the trial that Miss Benare is carrying an out-of-wedlock child from her failed illicit relationship with Professor Damle, the missing cast-member.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/nMFLhcaUhFIuhMEJGQcU6MYbqDA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silence!
