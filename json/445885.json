Covering six square blocks in Toronto's North York, the area readily evokes images of vandalism, high-density subsidized housing, racial tension, despair and crime. By focusing on the lives of several of the residents, many of them black or members of other visible minorities, the film provides a powerful view of a community that, contrary to its popular image, is working towards a more positive future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tXHkDX9ltU5IxiP5JDAePzehA0p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1983-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Feeling: Struggle for a Community","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
