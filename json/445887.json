This time out, Elliot is teamed with singing cowboy Tex Ritter, while comedy relief is provided by diminutive stuntman Frank Mitchell. Returning from Civil War duty, Hickok, Tex Martin (Ritter) and Cannonball (Mitchell) find that their Texas home town is under the rule of Colonel Monroe (Forrest Taylor), a bush-league dictator with his own police force. In true Hitlerian fashion, Monroe extorts huge sums of money from the populace, terrorizing them into silence. Our three heroes set about to put an end to Monroe's regime, with time out for Tex Ritter's musical interludes.","popularity":0.872,"poster_path":"/jcsEycFLqLjhcKd2nRnKQdBnX12.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A ROARING BLAST OF BLAZING ACTION!","title":"The Lone Star Vigilantes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
