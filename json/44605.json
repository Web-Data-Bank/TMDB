To fulfill their commission from a Swiss cultural festival, they adapted a great Swiss novel, “Aimé Pache, Painter from the Vaud,” by Charles Ferdinand Ramuz, from 1911 (about a local artist who goes to Paris for his education and then returns home) and extruded its autobiographical analogies to Godard’s own life and work. Using a choice set of clips from Godard’s films to coincide with events from the painter’s life, verbal references to modern times and to Godard’s own—Sartre, the late nineteen-sixties, the cinema—and images of the Swiss terrain, which plays a decisive role in the work of Pache, Godard, and Miéville (an important filmmaker in her own right), they produce the effect of mirrors within mirrors.","popularity":0.869,"poster_path":"/62DbWVnFqCyHBUX4ECybPDj1tRy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8138,"logo_path":"/4P6c8TiJZhL2z7b0LbPOUTZwP4z.png","name":"Vega Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":33266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Périphéria","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2002-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An almost ecstatic recounting by Jean-Luc Godard of the making of a painting by the apocryphal artist Aimé Pache.","title":"Liberty and Homeland","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":9}
