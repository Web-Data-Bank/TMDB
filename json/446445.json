At first, Judge Lena Kalbach does not allow the lawsuit - until it turns out that Bergen, as a sperm donor, is the biological father of the child. A delicate case for which Lena has to find a solution with great tact. But she is also personally affected by the issue of fatherhood: Her adult daughter Nike finally wants to know who her father is. In the third part of the popular TV series, Michaela May again plays the smart judge Lena Kalbach.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ozlEJryyCQh32VK0ErgJjav2koF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmpool Film und Fernsehproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alles was recht ist – Väter, Töchter, Söhne","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
