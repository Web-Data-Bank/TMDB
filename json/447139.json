When they were only five or six or ten  years old, their parents snatched them from the playground and handed them to much older  men to be married. They recall the violence and fear they were subjected to, the  pregnancies at the age of eleven or twelve, becoming mothers when they were still little girls  themselves.  It was an open secret but one they put aside forever, because revealing it might tear their  family apart, causing commotion and creating chaos. The memories of their tragic childhood  never healed â€“ they were simply suppressed for the sake of their children, their livelihoods,  and their husbands. No more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4tUWqvO4QbDTgdZcESx0HexOgHP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Child Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
