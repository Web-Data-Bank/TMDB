Produced and narrated by American activists Robert Van Lierop, it details the relationship of the liberation to the wider regional and continental demands for self-determination against minority rule. It notes the complicit roles of foreign governments and companies in supporting Portugal against the African nationalists. Footage from the front lines of the struggle helps contextualize FRELIMO's African socialist ideology, specifically the role of the military in building the new nation, a commitment to education, demands for sexual equality, the introduction of medical aid into the countryside, and the role of culture in creating a single national identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a10kzZHujI1qUnUvOxs6q2b2fDs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Luta Continua (The Struggle Continues)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
