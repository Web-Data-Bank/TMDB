In the USSR, extraordinary measures were being taken to speed up work on the atomic project, but to no avail. The reason was simple: there was no uranium in the country.  Despite the post-war devastation, already in early 1946, geological exploration parties were organized, the entire territory of the USSR was covered by uranium prospecting works. The hero of the film is a geologist on one of these expeditions. But when his friend dies, his life begins to change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Вооружённое сопротивление","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
