The scar was a result of a bullet shot in his direction by an Israeli soldier in the late 1940’s. Focusing on the sagas of myth and the construction of memory, members of the same family are filmed individually as they narrate their version of the same event. By scratching the surface of family history, the project explores the scar as a foundational hinge that arranges reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cVjqW5iclK17y2wgC5iFdtc6q8K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mnemosyne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
