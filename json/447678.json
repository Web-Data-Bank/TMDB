First unleashed in 1989, the classic British series emerged from Rowan Atkinson's stage performances which featured the silent, physically outrageous comic acting that won him an International Emmy Award, a Cable Ace Award, the Golden Rose of Montreaux--and a global cult following. The madcap brilliance of the awkward man-child puts Bean right on par with greats such as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Atkinson's visual humor and infantile havoc-wreaking transcend linguistic frontiers in this irresistible comedy montage. This special collection features the best of the best, with absolutely classic sketches featuring all the funniest, most gut-busting moments in Bean history.","popularity":4.227,"poster_path":"/rBqEYHCv9DI2Wk3JjsuG4YQSLT4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8376,"logo_path":null,"name":"A\u0026E Home Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":686,"logo_path":"/qMVjV8YFbxXrGVF4wD6hRjllVbr.png","name":"Tiger Aspect Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best of Mr. Bean","video":true,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":30}
