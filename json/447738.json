Across North America, newspapers are dying, but in Lakefield, Terry McQuitty, the town paperâ€™s publisher, carries on a rich, 150-year-old tradition. Set to the pace of small-town life, Unheralded is a testament to the vital role newspapers can still play, and the close bond between reporter and reader.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9J0t6gxPHEMd6VtFR5GkMtzYOkY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unheralded","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
