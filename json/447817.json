But not every child is born equal under the sun, and tragically so. The world we humans inhabit has a multitude of class and caste based structures that actively exist to prohibit social mobility and shackle scores of human beings in their often deplorable social, financial and emotional circumstances. Sadly, not even children are exempt from this (manmade) hierarchical structure. Their innocence is tarnished by the rigidity and the unavoidability of its invisible grip.  Most of them never get close to fulfilling their true potential and purpose in life due to this gargantuan system of financial and social constraints imposed upon them since birth, limitations they did nothing to deserve.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MODAK","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
