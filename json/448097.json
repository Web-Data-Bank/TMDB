You can transform your body in 60 days with this total body conditioning program. And you won't need equipment or weights—just the desire to dig deep and push past your limits.  In INSANITY®, Shaun T uses a method called Max Interval Training. It's not your typical interval workout. You'll do cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training. It all happens in long bursts of maximum-intensity exercises with short periods of rest so you can burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8KxAun6uQNyYr7d7IEuYeImUc4w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insanity: Insane Abs","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
