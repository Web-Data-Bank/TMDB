The moves are straight-forward classics like squats, leg lifts and pushups. Kelly maximizes their effectiveness with smooth transitions, a fast tempo and a large range of motion. She also integrates some more challenging movements and more intense body positions (e.g. an angled lunge or a wide-stance pushup). The two programs are very different — the first is all standing; the second is all floorwork. Both workouts target each muscle group with multiple exercises.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xDHpxlx68NmDglsjXoWumuZEsUj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 Minutes to Fitness Body Training","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
