The first program begins with a varied mix of athletic-style cardio favorites (always offering a “base” move if you get tired or distracted). That's followed by an aero/tone segment that builds muscle as it burns fat. The toning workout features alternating sets of proven body-sculpting classics (e.g. curls, lunges, push-ups). It starts with standing routines and ends with floorwork. Requires 2 to 5 lb. dumbbells.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x7ZkfzzpowBjeqzrMWppkbdPw7b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Widowmaker Films LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 Minutes to Fitness: Start Here","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
