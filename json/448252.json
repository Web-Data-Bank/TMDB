Lying there paralyzed, trapped within his own nightmare, other-worldly beings visit John. They are entities which exist in the darkest shadows of the night and can only be seen out of the corner of one's eye. These encounters begin to haunt John, transforming to complete terror as he discovers the entities' sole purpose... the abduction of his seven year old son. In the end, John will uncover the town's horrific secret, a portal on his land, and make one last attempt to save his son before the shadow people permanently take him away to their world.","popularity":6.548,"poster_path":"/ytkaL1wZcqgQKHLuU7Go3UxGpON.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quest Pacifica","origin_country":""},{"id":88183,"logo_path":null,"name":"DarkShed","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be Afraid","video":false,"vote_average":6.106,"vote_count":104}
