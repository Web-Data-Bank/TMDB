It is based on a popular folk song of the Punjab and is set in the historical period of Mir Manu that is notorious for large scale massacre of the Sikhs during the period 1748-1753. Sundri is a symbolic representative of that period and the daring nature of the Khalsa people. The Mughal leadership was bent upon annihilating the Sikhs. The rulers were corrupt and engaged in the systematic forced conversion of the non-Muslim people. The management of the government was in the hands of Nawabs and bandit who were grossly unfair, discriminatory, lustful and tyrannical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/di41jJ1ag0nqBuBmcUHbbq25ome.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vismaad Pte Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Brave Kaur","title":"Sundri - The Movie","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
