It leased men to build the Tower of Babel to reach heaven and surpass God, after which God punished them by destroying their unity. By using electronic language, echographical and televised images, Survival Signs dismantles the loss of the power of understanding and communication of language. As an example, the video presents the fight for survival or Iraqi children deprived of food - a way of cutting off their tongues. And what forbidden fruit had they tasted? What language would we like them to speak? That of having or that or being? Or, do we simply hope that they die without uttering a word?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oSuPHWebZeDHnq40NhtK5iQSRVI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Survival Signs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
