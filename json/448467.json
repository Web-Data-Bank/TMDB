Trees are ablaze with colour, and their splendor is reflected in the mirrored surfaces of the water, offering a glimpse of the landscape Lampman knew so well through the poet’s eyes and words. Lampman’s poem is read by broadcaster and poet George Whalley, with accompanying score by composer Eldon Rathburn.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1gHUIVxlcpjJsaci4Htb36Mf1Ja.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1961-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morning on the Lièvre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
