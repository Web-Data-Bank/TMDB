When ten men are arrested on a farm in Rivonia for conspiring to commit sabotage and violent acts against the repressive S. African government, tenacious lawyer Bram Fisher steps up to the challenge as lead counsel. He soon finds that political leader Nelson Mandela is also on trial. Mandela urges his fellow defendants to plead not guilty and shine light on the systemic corruption against the African people. As the outcome of the trial looks bleak, Mandela gives his famous \"I'm Prepared to Die\" speech, discussing how the ANC's resistance is justified. But will Mandela's impassioned speech save these men's lives?","popularity":1.817,"poster_path":"/f9oirFMellDVlBQEPzSxQpLGJtj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Act of Defiance","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":11}
