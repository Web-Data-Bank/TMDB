The Goose began to look like no one, just for some reason everyone laughed at him. The Sparrow helped him with advice, suggesting that the Goose's stupidity be replaced with the wisdom of the Owl. At the Owl, the Goose also learned that \"A smart bird can not be proud of other birds feathers.\" Recognizing his mistake, the Goose changes everything back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vuF2I85n4S2BGuik7KNN4CTSg1U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14599,"logo_path":"/hz8piJ9Np1MswUyav0JDNGf42pO.png","name":"Soyuzmultfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1955-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Kind of Bird Is This?","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
