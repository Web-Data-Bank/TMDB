She noted the absence, and wondered why. Born and raised in Damascus, Fattal studied in London, Beirut, and Paris. Two years earlier, she had moved back to Lebanon from France, and, after abandoning a project to change the world by overhauling the education system in the Arab countries of the Middle East, she had decided to become a painter. But the idea of self-portraiture perplexed her. A painting didnâ€™t seem like it would be enough. So she set up a video camera and a microphone, invited a few friends and family over, began talking, and continued for a good seven hours.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5MPbzYX0kyPaQiIiK7EGOcOqz4u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autoportrait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
