His wife, Lucy, has locked him in to a daily routine. His work in a small commercial shop and grocer's has worn him out. His dreams have evaporated into the drought of the beaten earth of Mindelo. Now forgotten, with his past as a great football player for Mindelense, in St Vincent in Cape Verde, he only has the belated compassion of his friends, neighbours, and cafe companions: \"He was important\", \"He was the keeper in Cape Verde\", \"He could have played for Benfica!\" Mane rejects the loss of his status as a hero. When training a youth team he sees himself again in KALU, a rebellious but talented youth. He is guided by a whirlwind of thoughts; he was also young, had opportunities, felt the sting of love and wasted his flame. A beaten leather ball shines in his hands once again, Benfica, his club, calls him to the Portuguese Cup Final.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hqhY7FehgaEW0Ey5WXAERwj9IuV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88197,"logo_path":null,"name":"I.C.Cinema- Cape Verde","origin_country":""},{"id":16582,"logo_path":null,"name":"David \u0026 Golias","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":88198,"logo_path":null,"name":"ACT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"CV","name":"Cape Verde"}],"release_date":"1998-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dribbling Fate","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
