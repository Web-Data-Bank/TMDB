Forgetting all about his fiance, Reggie and the Princess set off on a wild drinking and dancing escapade through the nightclubs of London. Wishing to return the favor, Princess Raviola whisks Reggie 3,000 years back in time to ancient Egypt, where she intends to show him how they partied in Pharaoh's Palace!","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/4Z3jxObSqNl4QjhuA7sPuGlwoI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berkeley Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1944-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Night of Magic","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
