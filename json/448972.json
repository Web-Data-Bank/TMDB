The characters are arriving as guests at a 10th Anniversary Dinner. The ﬁrst couple to arrive discovers that one of their hosts (Charley) has apparently attempted suicide...unsuccessfully. Charley’s wife, Myra, is nowhere to be found and neither are the servants. Through the course of the show, the audience never meets Charley or Myra. As more guests arrive, there are cover-ups, deceptions, mistaken identities, and a lot of huge laughs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s3eG6KjsPuklxG4FzCMuyA4CTLQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rumors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
