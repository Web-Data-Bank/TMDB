Bailey is lucky, that is, until he becomes the target of an elaborately-designed dognap scheme hatched by Constance's nasty nephew Caspar and his money-hungry wife Dolores. The despicable duo's wicked plan is to ultimately gain custody of the canine so they can get their greedy paws on his inheritance. Unfortunately for them, there's a thing or two they don't know about Bailey. Not only does he have great street smarts, he has great pals too. Bailey's loyal guardian Ted, kind-hearted animal advocate Marge, her daughter Sam, and a clever border collie named Tessa set out on a hilarious madcap adventure to free their four-legged friend and put the nasty dognappers out of business-for good!","popularity":3.565,"poster_path":"/XnA0Aswod1EvM29weR5xcFjgsq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Echo Bridge Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Hero Is Unleashed","title":"Bailey's Billion$","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":26}
