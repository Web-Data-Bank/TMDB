There he lives austerely, in a ramshackle house without electric light or unnecessary luxuries, and plays the banjo in a friends' club. Until one day, after many years, he receives the unexpected visit of his daughter Anna and his grandson Marc. Anna, unemployed for some time, says she has had to accept a job in France and is forced to leave her little son on the island with grandfather Samuel.","popularity":1.353,"poster_path":"/sHI3mAsZQm01WKpeHkFDkjZy5RE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34179,"logo_path":null,"name":"FoscaFilms","origin_country":""},{"id":10565,"logo_path":"/5djnxodjmgbzdXiNRllwhQPxANY.png","name":"Good Machine","origin_country":"US"},{"id":36921,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Perifèrica","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":107062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunrise Pictures","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":5085,"logo_path":"/mPuVc7m1Ki7OQQvAYwYfIlEI3vu.png","name":"TV3","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Formentera Lady","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":12}
