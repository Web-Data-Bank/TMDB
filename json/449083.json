Although based around the Motif ES, Sound Advice translates seamlessly to any model in the Motif range (the 'Classic', Racks, MO series, or the Motif XS/XF) and indeed can be applied to any hardware or software synth platform made in the past ten years that employs waveforms and 'analog-style' filters, envelope generators, LFOs etc, along with the now customary basket of digital effects.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nWFJBhonj1NAyX4BLsWKqyFdDbk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Analog-style Synthesis and Digital Effects explained and explored","title":"Sound Advice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
