Does the sick three-legged hound stand any chance of getting adopted, becoming healthy again and running across the fields of Essex? Why are the Greekies, the strays from Greece, so popular when it comes to being adopted abroad? With an unexpected ending, the film tries to discover whether there is any hope for the doomed dogs and for a doomed area outside Athens.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rescue, Animals, Documentary","title":"Greek Animal Rescue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
