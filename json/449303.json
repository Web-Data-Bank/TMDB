Burglar II, whom the residents mistake Hamburglar for, and the disco era of the '70s where they briefly encounter Mayor McCheese.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/x9mOHhJBrKtDdS2aLHydU05TMl0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59150,"logo_path":"/owpGkEh53XCB9dNoLpuaxvcLCOy.png","name":"Klasky-Csupo","origin_country":"US"},{"id":112952,"logo_path":"/1ZLVdbJgQ2S6oGr0JxY7f5p0Rwz.png","name":"McDonald's","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald: Have Time, Will Travel","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
