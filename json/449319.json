She has contributed her own footage to the programme by recording her studio and herself at work with her Hi-8 video camera. It reveals a range of unexpected sources from visceral horror to medical catalogues and exploitation movies, and explores her real interests and enthusiasms. She shows an intuitive and often humorous approach to her work, and reflects on the themes of her work since the late 1970s. She talks about her pivotal series known as the `Sex Pictures' in which she addresses the theme of sexuality in the light of AIDS and the arts censorship debate in the United States.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xSkKBNyCAI19ENumYrI5Rbb2fTr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cindy Sherman: Nobody's Here But Me","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
