Driven by a commitment to bear witness to the wars of our time after the events of 9/11, Chris was among the first in a new generation of war photographers since Vietnam. HONDROS explores the complexities inherent in covering more than a decade of conflict, while trying to maintain a normal life. It also examines the unknowable calculus involved in making split-second life and death decisions -- before, during and after his photos were made. Chris was killed in Libya in 2011, but he left a lasting impact on his profession that is still felt today.","popularity":3.267,"poster_path":"/eRk9EmZY93TAvBWu5wWz534ISYP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89261,"logo_path":"/pEIvnw8XMErTLclRxfKc6lyyv3c.png","name":"Nine Stories Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2266,"logo_path":"/owzVs2mguyyJ3vIn7EbgowpUPnk.png","name":"Bold Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":89260,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fox Tale Films","origin_country":""},{"id":188883,"logo_path":"/by1QQEULmsuLHOrD3WKbeGfui1S.png","name":"Vision Film Company","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"LR","name":"Liberia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LY","name":"Libyan Arab Jamahiriya"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hondros","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":16}
