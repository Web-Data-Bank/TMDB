The fish gasps for air and the fisherman holds it to his chest until it dies. This sequence—performed by a series of fishermen, of various ages and using various styles of capture—is the spine of the work, interrupted by passages of quiet natural beauty; one shot is a steady, stately pan through scores of trees and empty air behind.\" - Vinson Cunningham","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4S52qq0a02BhVXU7Og8cUxa5tUD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
