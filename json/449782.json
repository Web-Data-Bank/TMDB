Buildings. Parks.","overview":"The influential, provocative, and often radical art-making practices of Vito Acconci have earned him international recognition. Acconci has been a vital presence in contemporary art since the late 1960s; his confrontational and ultimately political works have evolved from writing to conceptual art, bodyworks, performance, film, video, multimedia installation and architectural sculpture. This catalogue presents a complete selection of a wide range of Acconci's works (accompanied by a text on each project), an interview with the artist, an extensive bibliography, and includes a DVD with three 20-minute videos in which Acconci narrates.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Kd3a35fQwlUWRaBwQQVwxpJusi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vito Acconci / Acconci Studio: Interiors.
