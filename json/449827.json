We all come into the Church torn apart by the world, but with time and the sacraments our souls are healed. Over the years, Aevia has starved her soul of nourishment and is on the edge, ready to jump and be done with the world, when God calls His Church to save her. She is mesmerized by the holiness and consolation within the Church, and her newfound emotions rise to the surface.","popularity":1.344,"poster_path":"/fsbxNT8ReUPxy8JVaL8Akl92a8d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aevia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
