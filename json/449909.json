Starting with their daily routine, their gestures endlessly repeated throughout a life, we look at the details, like heating the water to prepare the mate, rearing goats, and sewing. Time seems to stand still. We also look at matter, the wood that forms the house, the mountainous and arid landscapes. Sometimes, the silence is broken by a prayer or a song that seems to weave the invisible link between the red earth and the starry sky.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dbsKfhmcMgc44X48KMVAcDPrXmg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Centaur's Nostalgia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
