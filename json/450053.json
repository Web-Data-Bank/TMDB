The father lives in Syria, in a town near the Turkish border. The girl joins him to meet her new family and... to find her lost roots. Everything moves forward in fragments, of time and of space. It is not only an aesthetic choice. It is a form consistent with the state of war, with the fragility of existences, with the capturing of reality by the body and by the spirit. But everything moves forward, in its way, carried along by a painful energy that obstinately perforates the borders.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/aLcVfRatR9GBqkEEZT0xIVsQx5R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102208,"logo_path":"/m3NGbr5cr4XIF80L7BZzccEUsVl.png","name":"M.
