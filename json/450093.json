Forty years after capturing the iconic images of the Soviet invasion of Prague in 1968, the legendary Magnum photographer arrives in Israel and Palestine. On first seeing the nine-meter-high wall built by Israel in the West Bank, Koudelka is deeply shaken and embarks on a four-year project in the region which will confront him once again with the harsh reality of violence and conflict. Director Gilad Baram, Koudelka's assistant at the time, follows him on his journey through the Holy Land from one enigmatic and visually spectacular location to another.","popularity":0.696,"poster_path":"/iD7nCBem2T27iNuYxODktDYAZXq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nowhere Films","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":32252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produkce Radim Procházka","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Koudelka Shooting Holy Land","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":11}
