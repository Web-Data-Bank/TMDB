The series was finished in 2007 and shown as whole in the Venice Biennale the same year. Yang Fudong uses myths, individual memories and experiences as means to study identity and how it may be formed. In his films the spectator can sense the contradictions in the present and past China.  Seven Intellectuals in Bamboo Forest, Part 1, was filmed on the Yellow Mountain. The mountain has a significant status in the traditional Chinese painting. The scenery, the not so clear motives of each character in the film combined with the music creates an almost poetic atmosphere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jYhLhiUw5yADvVesrJncVR6yjth.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Intellectuals in Bamboo Forest, Part I","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
