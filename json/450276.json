In her words, “Making books is an art. Nothing beats holding a book in your hand, feeling its cover, turning its pages and even smelling the paper. When you write or draw into a journal, it is forever and leaves your touch in it. When you have a book that is handmade, you know that you are holding something that is made, with heart and soul, by a bookbinder.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9cDBJhcUdYsYNMtvkfsaZ4Jst1K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2016-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adelene Koh - Dddots","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
