His work has faded from view in the decades since leaving just a dedicated following including Stephen King and Mick Jagger. Holy Terrors is a new film aiming to bring Machen to a new audience and adapts six of his tales into a spine-tingling portmanteau film. Effectively capturing the unique atmosphere and feel of Machenâ€™s writing, Holy Terrors is sure to provide a night or two of uneasy sleep for the viewer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4JCecPUbS4ZzlX3VMqxqeloZScr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Obsolete","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holy Terrors","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
