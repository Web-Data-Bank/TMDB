Always a strong, charismatic singer, McLachlan now conjures a rare balance of delicacy and power, measured here in performances of signature songs that add a new, more muscular edge matching her band's rock firepower. Thus, \"Possession\" expands beyond its already sensual promise to touch on truly erotic abandon, while \"Building a Mystery\" focuses its portrait of a narcissistic poseur with a harder edge and a newly amended, R-rated lyric that's entirely appropriate.","popularity":1.328,"poster_path":"/oS8bx0MlInnhAypbKZeI4aLPJJT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sarah McLachlan Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":93295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oil Factory Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sarah McLachlan: Mirrorball","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
