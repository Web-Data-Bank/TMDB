As an architectural tour as well as a tribute to the remarkable architectural achievements of the 60s and 70s and to – among others architects– the great Henri Chomette, a special attention is given to users and passersby, to their gestures and ways of informally appropriating the spaces for their needs. Monumentality appears here as a reminder of the ambitious and utopian vision of an era and architecture itself becomes a metaphor for power that eventually reveals a state of lasting status quo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uScgJuCMZvSZ1y1kgSo6eOcvblS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avant l'envol","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
