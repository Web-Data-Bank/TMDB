Shot entirely in subjective camera, the audience will experience a day in the life of these three characters by hearing their internal monologue, dialog, and by seeing what they see as they go about their daily business. Since the movie is all about perception, all three characters lives intertwine in a scene that each character perceives completely different, leaving the audience to decide for themselves what really happened on this normal day. Each characters lives twist and turn as the movie progresses into a fun, yet different, cinematic adventure.","popularity":0.633,"poster_path":"/dSgEMQTetjs5l8EA6DiUbzglDPI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Envisage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
