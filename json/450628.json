Not in search of an identity, but in search of un-identities. Laerte creates and sends creatures to face reality in the fictional world of comic strips as a vanguard of the self. And, on the streets, the one who becomes the fiction of a real character. Laerte, of all the bodies, and of none, complicates all binaries. In following Laerte, this documentary chooses to clothe the nudity beyond the skin we inhabit.","popularity":1.684,"poster_path":"/6pefmBwp0xuHdUXbJEPHAwQjHjm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127817,"logo_path":null,"name":"True Lab","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laerte-se","video":false,"vote_average":7.097,"vote_count":36}
