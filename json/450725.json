Van der Keuken leaves the music undisturbed as an autonomous soundtrack and has the images engage in a sort of battle with it. These images are associations, fragments of events, scenes and situations. The film is preceded by a text by Bert Schierbeek.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1984-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
