Material which has been repeatedly re-filmed (a construction site, a rubbish incinerating plant, industrial graveyards, an antenna and line-drawing like frame that continually falls over) are exposed on top of each other. The result is that an unambiguous reading of the picture, to say nothing of their positioning in a fictive room cannot even be attempted. This type of calculated picture removal is carried to the point where the film strip is stopped in the projector (and hence the title) and burns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fWuJ719FuIXP6KmMmVSThx65l9I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freeze Frame","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
