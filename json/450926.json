Constructing and deconstructing a portrait, she weaves family and friends’ remembrances with an inquiry into her own work process. Her searching attitude suggests that with the loss of her father came a question of the role, not of a particular father, but the father figure—a refusal of authority, and an appreciation of her father’s cycles of learning, teaching, learning. As Danny Kaye, playing Hans Christian Andersen, tells a group of children the story of the piece of chalk that saw itself as a the source, not the transmitter of knowledge, one senses Fonoroff’s sorrow at the loss inherent in the film image, and a yearning for the source of the image, not just its projection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ldPLIvwOaY3RNrk6fJJEnEgFKdu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Knowledge They Cannot Lose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
