Robert is a writer who hasn't done much writing lately; instead, he's busy pushing the envelope with his toxic mix of boredom, drugs and a dalliance with a married woman, Elizabeth. In spite of Elizabeth's marital status, Robert falls for her completely -- a commitment that just may blow up in his face, along with the rest of his life.","popularity":2.798,"poster_path":"/9BgS6lBfwahNKiHM4K4J5stLkD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathfinder Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Until the Night","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
