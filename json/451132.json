These two artists were responsible for such masterpieces of Spanish cinema as Plácido and El verdugo (The Executioner). Here, Berlanga and Azcona collaborated for the first time, setting the stage for the post-war \"Berlanguiana\" vision that would develop.  José Luis López Vázquez plays Julián, a seedy swindler, who with his cronies tries to sell a streetcar to a rich but naive farmer, a newcomer to the city. High jinx ensue. With this film begins the great stage of Berlanga's filmmaking in which he mixes a little social criticism and notes of anti-clericalism with a great deal of farce.","popularity":1.124,"poster_path":"/vlv6vxSvkYnz7l94UEAfUrrWHxr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Estudios Moro","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1959-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Streetcar for Sale","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
