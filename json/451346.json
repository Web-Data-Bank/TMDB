While she stares at half filled glasses on the table sound replaces her gaze. Harmonic tones exude and induce a trance like state over the woman. Her meditative harmonies are disrupted when an ominous character arrives with the intent to ingest the song. After consuming the beauty the dark character leaves. Left alone, the adolescent woman employs thaumaturgy to lure her song back to life again.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Encounter","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
