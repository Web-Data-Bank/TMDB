Believing Carson can save the Republican Party, they successfully draft him to run, raise millions of dollars and catapult him to the top of the polls. However, as Carson's political inexperience begins to show, his constant media gaffes make fundraising increasingly difficult. Donors and voters abandon Carson's campaign as wallets close, hearts open and faith is tested. As Trump inexplicably rises, the campaign descends into chaos and the PACmen begin to wonder - did they pick the wrong savior?","popularity":0.775,"poster_path":"/nou2UxYy5QSLSpFcFi2vYYENIO4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Political fundraising... it's not brain surgery.","title":"PACmen","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
