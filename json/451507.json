But just a few short years later, Akron's most important product was, ever so briefly, music. In the mid-1970s, a group of local bands took over an old rubber workers' hang-out in downtown Akron called The Crypt and created a mix of punk and art rock that came to be known as \"the Akron Sound.\" And for a while, it was almost \"the next big thing.\" Almost.  It's Everything, and Then It's Gone, a Western Reserve PBS production written and directed by Phil Hoffman., takes viewers back to a time when the music really did mean everything. And for the men and women in these local bands, it was a way out of the factory.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/j6oR1eyZiXrrjGzyj5frlWp74BB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Akron Sound: It's Everything, and Then It's Gone","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
