In 1999, they met in Cuba, a country that seemed to mirror many of their questions, hopes and fears. The film looks at their real lives and different roads to exile; two utopian visions sought under very different conditions on separate continents. It is a double portrait of two extraordinary women that succeeds in avoiding the twin pitfalls of condemnation and glorification.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/49zflgOXqFBBuL90jFsHiv78CIg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85,"logo_path":null,"name":"Konrad Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":158299,"logo_path":null,"name":"foschfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2000-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greater Freedom Lesser Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
