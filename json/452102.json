Suddenly, he has to sneeze. He pauses and listens. After a few quiet moments, he murmurs, “Bless you”. Then he moves towards the camera and continues: “I am a scream without an echo.” The film is the tragicomedy of a man searching for his echo, the way out of his loneliness. All paths are blocked and his quest becomes more and more of an odyssey. Evading his own insanity and narrowly escaping death, he gradually notices that the search can only end with oneself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n64wG3Rbkg7hosKlPt9Vu41beS7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2008-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"René","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
