In Don Letts's documentary, Gil tells his own story for the first time-from being one of the first black children to integrate an all white Southern state school to becoming the Godfather of Rap. There are contributions from Chuck D, Mos Def, Richi Havens and the Last Poets, among others. Filmed in October 2003, Gil performs live and recites poetry out on the streets of Harlem, which have inspired so much of his music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3yu0CttJZjNaejcBaU9v03IGofq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":53873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Something Else B.V.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gil Scott-Heron: The Revolution Will Not Be Televised","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
