Or two viatica: the testamentary document written by Pasolini not long before his death (Le vide du pouvoir en Italie), which metaphorically communicated his political despair about the “disappearance of the fireflies”, and that of Georges Didi-Huberman (2009), which, on the contrary, refers to their “survival”. Vincent Dieutre travels across the far south of Europe in search of today’s “fireflies” who invent a political life on a daily basis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pWMXFiKV2zDmpSY7U5k4aKnerxU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orlando Ferito - Wounded Roland","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
