They were assigned the toughest and most dangerous area of Japan: Hiroshima Prefecture, which included the atom-bombed city. The Forgotten Force tells for the first time the story of Australia's role in Japan. Rare archival and private footage, photographs and eyewitness accounts from both sides vividly recreate the atmosphere of post-war Japan - the horror of Hiroshima and its aftermath; the struggle to build a new \"democratic\" society while under the heel of military rule; the growth from suspicion and fear to friendship and trust between foes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xsuuV3CcxdID9HfaVfJVyytkxbG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Australia","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":1253,"logo_path":"/6f0A0AqIPHYheRb90tVMutuzSnP.png","name":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":99397,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Japan Foundation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1994-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tells the story of Australia's role as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in the occupation of Japan","title":"The Forgotten Force","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
