In the late 1960s, big mainframe  computers owned by large corporations and the government were seen as tools of control. The Hippie movement and the anti-Vietnam war protests served as a hotbed for a revolutionary idea: creating an affordable home computer to be used by  ordinary people  as a counterbalance to Big Brother. Well, the rest is history, but  what has happened to the early ideals and the initial ethos of free sharing? As one of  the visionaries puts it: Its true that what I helped to create is todays establishment. Thats what I was trying to get rid of:the establishment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wGTvcUJoQ4gklcl7hnjS6P6EdEo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10946,"logo_path":"/gk4SFkJ3G49gGL308zymD8QGNw.png","name":"WDR/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SILICON VALLEY REVOLUTION","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
