It looks at the thinking, innovation, and experimentation involved in trying to create the next evolution of what the office could be.  The film follows the design and construction of the New York headquarters of digital agency R/GA (in collaboration with architects Foster + Partners) who have been experimenting with how physical and digital space can better interact. Digital technology has radically changed how and where most of us work, but the physical spaces we work in havenâ€™t kept up with that transformation.","popularity":0.792,"poster_path":"/p2eZayhzCmEArOlxNPwpcmreTpT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Workplace","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
