It tells the story of a thoroughly modern family of three members. In their struggle for money, the parents fail to devote much time or attention to their five-year-old daughter, Anja. They do not have the time or patience to explain things to her and they give her what she wants just to ‘buy some peace’. “Brother for a Day” at first glance appears to be a story of different nationalities; in fact, it refers to the divide between the child’s world and the world of adults.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bS2AtgAAn1lPemSJDCVpGkSlGGM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89111,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lunar Produkcija","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2016-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brother for a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
