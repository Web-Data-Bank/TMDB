They listen, enchanted by his limpid voice, and suggest that he becomes a member of their orchestra. Thus, the newly-wed day laborer gets a second job at Mr. Lefteris’ night club. His wife, Marina, soon joins him at the club, and, before long, she too goes on stage, cuts capers and charms everyone. Her success, however, has a negative impact on the couple’s relationship, since Marina’s admirers as well as those of Grigoris’, turn one away from the other.","popularity":0.891,"poster_path":"/pzboWPSHusz1JE2It8JQhWxMNS8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Th.
