His father nurtures his exuberant and insatiable curiosity of new experiences– from climbing a crumbling wall to discovering the natural world. As a father-son bond grows, the mother with camera observes, gets lost into a solitary landscape and returns. The fleeting and glowing visual field evokes the delicate tension between distance and intimacy. Richly toned black and white positive, negative and solarized images, combined with snippets of voice, suggest the texture of memory. Reeves shot, hand-processed, solarized and colored Strawberries in the Summertime in rural Ontario at the “Film Farm” Independent Imaging Retreat run by filmmaker Philip Hoffman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lMejmvfgATEtv0xJdGVv1wCsTKA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strawberries in the Summertime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
