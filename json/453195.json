Sinister forces surround Madame G (Winsome Brown) as she tries to bond with her favorite undead. Using magic and ritual to give them new life and pleasures, Madame G is shocked by the devastating outcome. This camp and experimental reworking of early silent horror was inspired by both the un-staged Aaron Copland ballet Grohg, and the film that stirred the young Copland to write his ballet, Nosferatu.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wI5FQ53OuqVmoEcbF7iWtOmLWTM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadows Choose Their Horrors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
