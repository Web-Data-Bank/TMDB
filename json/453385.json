Famed as a place that wants you dead, this film follows a rag tag team of field biologists to some of the harshest corners of the planet, where they track the impact of climate change and ocean health by counting penguin populations. From the tip of Argentina to the ominous Deception Island, 'The Penguin Counters' is a treacherous, heart warming journey by a 21st century Dr. Doliitle who dreams of conserving this stunning but fragile region for future generations.","popularity":1.232,"poster_path":"/jV4BMhnCQdE4u5Upqo3GefIEoXY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Getzels Gordon Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AQ","name":"Antarctica"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tackling climate change, one penguin at a time...","title":"The Penguin Counters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
