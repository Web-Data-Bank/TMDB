Taking inspiration (as well as the original title) from the seminal 1974 movie Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Headcheese was filmed in and around locations of the famous horror film, featured as dilapidated ruins and vestiges of their former glory. Although not a horror film in the traditional sense, Headcheese follows a tortured killer’s mental unravelings as he comes to grips with his inner demons, resulting in a hallucinatory short film that is as raw as it is bleak. With a pervasively harsh, noise-focused soundtrack to match the intense visual decay, Headcheese is a compelling, albeit experimental visual document of torment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A7ACmeyJL6XkxjG2YxfHbq2zHZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Luke 8:29","title":"Headcheese","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
