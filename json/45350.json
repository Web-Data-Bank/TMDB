The film centers on two teenaged gangs who basically terrorize their neighborhoods with their anarchic behavior. There are few limits to their unpleasant philosophy of \"desire equals acquisition.\" The loosely structured tale reaches its climax at a concert where the two rival groups collide.","popularity":2.2,"poster_path":"/zNZInVQv3yZBff4AcOEYnDSx6wK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122333,"logo_path":null,"name":"Actes Prolétariens","origin_country":""},{"id":7799,"logo_path":null,"name":"TF1 International","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crack 6T","video":false,"vote_average":5.898,"vote_count":44}
