This discreet man begins his day by listening to the messages left on his answering machine (“Bernardo, have you seen the latest images of Pluto?”), to birdsongs, or to Beethoven. He makes telescopes, polishes lenses, gets annoyed with administrative hassles or sits on the terrace in order to “float in space” with the help of his binoculars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cs5uwXVFvSVCkLESk7Z0tFHt6FB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kappa Crucis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
