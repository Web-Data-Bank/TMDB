Between astronomy and legends, Marko Grba Singh seems to compose a mysterious and polysemous tableau. From folk tales heroes such as William Tell, Prince Marko or Sanduo for the Naxi, passing by a miraculous catch, Gods besotted with each other, or the absence of walls built around a city because of the ambiguity of Chinese characters, 'Stars of Gaomeigu' dresses the bodies and contemporary images of mythological tales.","popularity":0.877,"poster_path":"/oPgcsCZOnval5bj3azHR7ugbopV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Looking China Project","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":24615,"logo_path":"/bPTRJHgDP6UOGcSpd1ViSolzMk4.png","name":"Non-Aligned Films","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2017-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stars of Gaomeigu","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
