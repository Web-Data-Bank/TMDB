Below the edge of the roof, a man peers up at her while painting the eaves. The director, in order to add zest to the film, had threads attached to the hem of the woman's garments to make it appear as though the wind was blowing her skirts and allowing the painter to see what he should not. The woman hanging out the wash suddenly discovers the illicit observer, picks up a bucket filled with soapy water, and throws it upon him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1904-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Windy Day on the Roof","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
