As always, Elliot is a \"peaceable man\"--until he beats the tar out of those who rile him. The problem with Elliot's more expensive Republic vehicles is that action invariably took a back seat to plot, romance, costumes and decor. Within a year of Old Los Angeles, Elliot started a more austere, less prettified and far superior western series.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lBAX1KiOtiBgMzUyu8PAbH3xbrr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"DARING DESPERADO - FIGHTING MARSHAL - WOMAN OF MYSTERY - MEXICAN SPITFIRE","title":"Old Los Angeles","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
