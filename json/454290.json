Export demonstrates how the body of the consumer, especially that of the female consumer, is co-opted by commercialism. In tongue-in-cheek fashion, A Perfect Pair celebrates the modern-day co-mingling of fetish objects, as a body builder seduces a prostitute at a bar saying, “Your eyes are the most beautiful blue ad-space. Your cheek could promote a Mercedes. Your neck could be a slogan for styled technology.” Export’s work is centered around the evolving role of women in a culture where images increasingly displace material reality. A Perfect Pair wonderfully illustrates the inescapability of advertising’s “regime of signs\", the signifying network of personal and product values that is effectively encoded on the space of women’s bodies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jB7sh6RjrTAcTDGT44IV54UkW4C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Perfect Pair","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
