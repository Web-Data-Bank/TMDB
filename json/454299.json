Minimal variations in their movement can be seen. The screen gradually lightens, and a roughly hewn wooden structure becomes visible. The light-colored rectangles turn out to be window openings of a log cabin with luminous white interior walls which is swiftly rotating on its axis. Subtle changes in the light and the cameraÂ´s distance and angle transform this presumably abstract animation into a concrete setup for a filmic and architectural experiment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bZb3g2wqvW8vYUp2L4S8bow7JGa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gyre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
