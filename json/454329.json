Bill's roots in hardcore punk and thrash metal, combined with years of putting passion to work, forged a signature sound that would ultimately become the backbone of the sludgy, psychadelic and progressive riffs that are Mastodon.  In this honest and unflinching feature-length documentary, Bill reveals all that he has sacrificed to achieve his dreams - and what he learned from fifteen years on the road. From the lowest of lows, to international success as one of today's biggest metal bands, it's all here.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ap3gUgqL5cj7new0ed01pLVhc2t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Kelliher: The Sound and The Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
