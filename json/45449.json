They're the atypical modern day couple living it up in Beijing, though the latter is suspect of the former's promiscuity. He loathes the time when he has to bring his girlfriend back to the village to meet his parents, and to get the stamp of approval from his father (played by Yuen Wah). So they device a plan, and that is to look for a substitute girlfriend (hence the title Contract Lover), whose mission is to be as disgusting as possible, so that Dad will tell Fat to find anyone else better than the current beau, and hence, for Fat to introduce Rachel.","popularity":1.735,"poster_path":"/tMKDrGdMGNZl4TxWod8uNJECrCp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Contract Lover","video":false,"vote_average":4.857,"vote_count":7}
