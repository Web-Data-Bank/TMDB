A coincidence causes the former shrunken and skeletonized school principle to rise again. When she manages to return to real life she almost defeats Otto Leonhard, manages to shrink Dr. Schmitt-Gössenwein and Felix' parents, and takes over the school. It takes Felix, Ella and their gang to set the levers in motion to save the school and bring Dr. Schmitt-Gössenwein and his parents back to their original size again.","popularity":7.392,"poster_path":"/7335uX2btMkwFGndN0OGeFCvFgn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Eyes Fiction","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":66749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Karibufilm","origin_country":""},{"id":2616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mini Film","origin_country":""},{"id":28276,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARRI Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-01-18","revenue":8351526,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Small parents.
