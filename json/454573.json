Unlike its predecessor, which was a period drama in style, this film is more contemporary, incorporating issues such as corruption at a general contractor. The dynamism of the farmers' revolt, with its mass mobilization of extras, is also a highlight of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3yNpo0bI4NQb5CvkablT6Dfjorg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Widow: Bliss in a Mourning Dress","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
