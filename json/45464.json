When hit by a car, he is the sixty billionth human being to die on earth, and is on transit to Polaris, en route to a yet more sophisticated form of existence in Vega. Given a reprieve of five days and a chance to be reunited with his love on earth, he cannot reveal his true identity behind the temporary facade he must present to her. Both boy and girl eventually learn, through a tangle of difficult and miraculous events, how love and good things always find ways of creeping into people's lives when people are not greedy and least expect these blessings.","popularity":4.141,"poster_path":"/iFVGr35qpPKCVfslkttGGQfYETv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168925,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Harvest (China) Company Limited","origin_country":""},{"id":5686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sil-Metropole Organisation","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1999-08-21","revenue":2189278,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fly Me to Polaris","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":23}
