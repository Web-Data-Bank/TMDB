Despite his decline, Phettberg has remained a charismatic, unique \"pyre\" (as he calls himself) who documents his slowly fading life daily on the Internet and in his weekly column in the Viennese city magazine \"Falter\" and struggles to survive as Austria's best-known welfare recipient. Sobo Swobodnik shows this daily struggle of a one-time star who became a patronized outsider - with three strokes, a heart attack, extreme bladder weakness and an irrepressible will to go on living.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/toRxDd1b9eS8x6PiQwjzbMnasdV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Papst ist kein Jeansboy","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
