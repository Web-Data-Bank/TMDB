Filmmaker Marc Geerards tracked down 200 people and asked them to appear in front of the camera again, this time a film camera and in a setting of their own choice. A fascinating social document which portrays the passing of time, and the evolvement of the individual as well as the sub culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x0AzuGVUVto64TR3COtlFlNLY1k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradiso Stills","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
