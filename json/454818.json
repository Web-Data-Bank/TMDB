A naive woman with stars in her eyes for an old Hollywood world long gone, and a dream of a love story lost in modern society. With the innocence of a child and the temper of a psychopath, she is thrilled when auditions for a new musical film starring heart throb Jack Baron are announced. With a spring in her step and a song in her heart, Fanny knows this is the big break she's been waiting for, and as long as nobody stands in her path, everything should work out just dandy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iifYtEnuA3LTQW9y8TWHsBrJkYL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89595,"logo_path":null,"name":"Make Trouble Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2012-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Auditioning Fanny","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
