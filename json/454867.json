A master pianist, Bola de Nieve was a mainstay through the middle portion of the 20th century, with his music almost omnipresent in South America cinema throughout those formative decades. With Bola de Nieve's famous statement \"I'm a sad person, but my songs sound happy\" in mind, Sanchez-Montes also looks at the influence of the musician's African heritage and homosexuality upon Bola de Nieve's unique musical style.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vd2MoROwTptavkvonkTBEhnDexe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"},{"id":89604,"logo_path":null,"name":"atico 7","origin_country":""},{"id":6878,"logo_path":"/fIfZV1HuiG27Ijk6apChuyoUMTf.png","name":"Canal Sur","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":89605,"logo_path":"/7dDFsnEk5Gp6OoXM2vuw5UdTfSw.png","name":"Canal Once","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2003-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bola de Nieve","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
