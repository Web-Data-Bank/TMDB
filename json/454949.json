In the past, postpartum mothers were instructed to breastfeed lying on their side or sitting up with baby supported by a pillow. This worked for some mothers but many found these positions uncomfortable and struggled with latching difficulties. You will see ethnically diverse mothers and babies in a variety of settings: a delivery room, a postpartum hospital room after a cesarean birth, at home in bed, on a couch, in different chairs, and in an outdoor caf√©.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nnIkq0jK5etYQM9ESrad5Niv1Nb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biological Nurturing - Laid-back Breastfeeding for Mothers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
