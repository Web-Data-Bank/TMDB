The boy's imagination spins wildly as he and his family--loaded down with all their worldly goods and their other-worldly \"baggage\"--make their way from the shtetl to America. Inspired by the paintings of Marc Chagall, director Efim Gribov interprets the workings of Motl's imagination via comic and grotesque figures, ghosts from the past, and a dreamy, surreal atmosphere. The film's tragi-comic tone and theme involving the American Dream make for an inspired viewing experience.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/7CJTixZgjnrOlAjXnGZzuGpYW4w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170208,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":138192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Films","origin_country":""},{"id":174029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unirem","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1992-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about the American Dream.","title":"We Are Going to America","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
