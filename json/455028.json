Between Damascus and Copenhagen, two filmmakers from two different cultures try to tell real stories of love, life and death in the age of the revolution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uBIfcLRJLUGkTiR8aXdCF7lRRKx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"True Stories of Love, Life, Death and Sometimes Revolution Subscribe Now €5 a month","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
