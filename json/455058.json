Annonciation dances the encounter between the Angel Gabriel and Mary, when the angel announces that she is God’s chosen one – an essential scene of conception, of the birth of faith and culture. 2.- Les Raboteurs (1988), directed by Cyril Collard. A contemporary couple in an empty room in a Parisian. They talk of love, vision, points of view and illusion. Is what these three dancers on the wooden have frozen in space with their choreographed movements and the positions of the three workers in Gustave Caillebotte’s painting The Floor Scrapers? 3.- Un trait d'union (1992), directed by Angelin Preljocaj. Adaptation of La Chambre by Jean-Paul Sartre. A story of a woman who has married and her second husband has turned insane. Her whole surrounding urges her to let the man be transported into an asylum, yet she refuses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o10Q2KvwzjUCj8p95Ts3avm3pCG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Topologie de l'invisible","video":true,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
