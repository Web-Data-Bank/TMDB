Strange how things come full circle. Years before, in their small Kansas hometown, they unraveled the mysteries of love and lust together: He left to be a pilot, and she took off for the spotlights of Hollywood. Years later, a cabbie picks up a late night fare in Bel-Aire, and they meet once again. Their separate paths have led each of them to this point.
