This surface gradually begins to crumble and a bubbling of dusty gold begins, like a geyser, to break up this tension. The surface of paints and rhythms flows with the water and everything inside of the body of work spills out until electrical creative charges accompany the liquid gold and rock. Suddenly, out of this storm comes a red and yellow explosion of warmth and creativity, spilling out over the body like a lava flow.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/v9X9RZfYebbCAPpxomzZSqujQyQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moon Streams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
