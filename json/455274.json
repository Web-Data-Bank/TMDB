The Continental survived the transition by converting its rooms into affordable housing units, becoming a home for those with few places to go. The night manager, Brian, once a freelance photographer who survived the horrors of war in Vietnam, shares his duties with his colleague Linda. Together they manage both the Continental and the individual struggles of its tenants, providing more than a roof over the heads of those who live under their supervision. Bringing a fresh focus to one of the most photographed places on Earth, director and cinematographer Jesse McCracken develops an intimate and caring portrait of the residents of this modest micro-community set against the backdrop of neon-lit tourist attractions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mqkPuZ0UBGThXtD1W9iiaRArHaz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
