Хребет безумия","overview":"More than 100 years ago, explorers raced to discover the South Pole. Now scientists are racing to discover the secret subterranean world of rivers and lakes buried miles beneath it. In 1974, scientists made a sensational discovery: a vast lake underneath the icy desert of Antarctica, untouched for 400.000 years, Lake Vostok.  In spring 2012, after 40 years of drilling, Russian scientist broke through the ice. In two different narrative strands the film tells the story of the evolution of life and climate, the story of four decades of exploration in the coldest place on Earth, and it accompanies the scientists on their final trip to the camp.  The film also explores the mythologies and legends surrounding Antarctica – from H.P. Lovecraft to James Cameron: the ‘Mountains of Madness’ have lured many into their realm – not many left unscathed.","popularity":0.808,"poster_path":"/8J5WNlsEIIOMiKEVY6CtYnyUFaU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170204,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lake Vostok.
