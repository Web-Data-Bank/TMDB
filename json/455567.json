Situated 300 miles from the North Pole, where polar bears outnumber humans, and bearing the distinction of being the northernmost town in the world, Longyearbyen is a community with an unforgiving climate, dreary isolation and an uncertain economic future. Like many small towns, Longyearbyen was once a bustling industrial hub that’s now struggling to find innovative ways to sustain itself. This Cold Life is filmmaker Darren Mann’s visually stunning portrait that illuminates a tight-knit group of colourful and resourceful residents who are dedicated to preserving the land they call home. Through charming individual reflections, including two men who fought to change a law to establish a brewery and become the town’s only export, we experience what it’s like to live in unity for our neighbours’ well-being.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/74ft2ouAs6RrrEI0FParSPtopah.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Cold Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
