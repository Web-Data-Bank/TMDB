That fun has been taken away from the game and fewer and fewer kids are choosing to not participate in youth athletics. You only get so much time to spend with your kids. You need to make sure that when it's all said and done, you have no regrets. With the help of George Brett, Ned Yost, Cat Osterman, Joe Simpson ( Fox Sports Atlanta and the Atlanta Braves) and many others this soft subtile approach takes you on a journey through the sandlot and shows you what it takes to bring the fun back to the games your kids have chosen to play! As George Brett says, 'When you realize that your child is not going to be a big leaguer you will have a lot more fun!'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sandlot Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
