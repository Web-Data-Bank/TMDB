He had to make life-changing decisions. This film is about taking risk, embracing change, overcoming the impossible, and finding hope.","popularity":0.679,"poster_path":"/yv6xevDude8rBacGZnIP6Csg3Lg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Streets of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
