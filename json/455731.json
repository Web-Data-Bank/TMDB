It is based on a collection of memoirs of the guerrilla members. Due to the fact that it happened during World War II and there was not much secrets, this movie is that it was more realistic than other movies in that many real names were used, and the actual site was not changed either like other war movies of the time. The drawback of the movie was that in the latter stage of World War II, the guerrilla force was developed into an impressive 400 plus members from its original beginning of 3, and it launched many major offensives against the enemy, but this part was not shown. The movie only concentrated on the time there were only several dozen members.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o97njCdg5YuDcNBO65Oj6LVL8lX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shanghai Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Railroad Guerrilla","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
