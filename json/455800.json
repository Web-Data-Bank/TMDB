As her story unfolds, we see a group of contemporary 14-year-old girls. Their procession of portraits permits the spectator to see simultaneously forward and back, into the future and towards the past. A miraculous testimonial that uses eye contact to focus the viewer inward and evoke unexpected emotions.","popularity":0.808,"poster_path":"/dH7zvRkvdRpPLQ8iG9jHdzJcCMX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121072,"logo_path":"/7ltdaYSC47Stv2mYpgX2h2D1ino.png","name":"Pristine Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was Only 14","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
