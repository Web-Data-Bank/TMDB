'It’s like a theatre here', one says in the beginning of the film, and it indeed is, the Theater of Life. The young women working in the office have a job that shifts from being verbally attacked and called idiots, to situations where they are subject to flirt, or where they master the happy ceremony of marriage. Faces, joy, sorrow, fun, despair... It’s all very well composed, rhythmical, with atmosphere conveyed, and lives up to what a documentary should be: multilayered and universal. And about Life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iBdWEgmtdyVdROWJQe8fVPs0QvJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89931,"logo_path":"/lY9Z8cuNulmL8HQgNAYUa4Lkkrt.png","name":"Lendoc","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2005-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Civil Status","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
