The film also showcases Sergei Yuktevich's fondness for formal experimentation. It is nominally adapted from Mayakovsky's play \"The Bedbug\" and his screenplay \"Forget All About the Fireplace.\"","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/gelWZvYQeJMzEVki1Dj201pWhMR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1976-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mayakovsky Laughs","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
