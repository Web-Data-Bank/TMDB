Provides an almost hour-long look at the band and its crew during the final dates of their 2002 Vapor Trails Tour, specifically their first-ever Brazilian shows in Porto Alegre, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. Behind the scenes footage shows the band weathering the rigors of a sometimes comically catastrophic tour, with their innate humor and grace. This documentary, by longtime Rush photographer Andrew MacNaughtan, shows the band and crew at their most light-hearted, though still thoughtful. We see the band's arrival in Brazil, to the unexpected onslaught of Brazillian fans boiled over in the culmination of a lifetime's anticipation. Following this are insights from the band and their crew, which provide a view into their longevity as well as ample evidence of the individual strengths and varied senses of humor that helped them achieve it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lR5P3KWtnhwws0TJpoSvO4g9uK8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coming Home Entertainment Group","origin_country":""},{"id":118238,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anthem Entertainment Group Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boys in Brazil","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
