Water became more precious than gold. Now in 2005, settlers are coming back, meeting new challenges, and age-old adversaries. A U.S. Marshal and his cyborg partner patrol the American West. A hard-as-nails female boss heads two U.S. Marshals (one human, one bionic) in Badlands 2005, a concept where the near future sees water as a more precious commodity than gold. The West of America has been deserted after droughts a decade earlier, and now a re-population program is underway.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mOFhuiF5RzDFTv7sIkxKsJcFF0o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Badlands 2005","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
