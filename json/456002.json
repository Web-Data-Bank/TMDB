The school is known for its anti-authoritarian educational methods founded on the egalitarian principles of A.S. Neill, a socialist schoolmaster from Scotland often described as a “cynical utopian”. In this project, Almborg has been looking at the school today in relation to its image, by researching and using the school’s film and video archive. The idea has been twofold: to trace a visual history of a place and to look at what can be described as a “utopian image,” how it might be constructed and what potentials and problems it might encompass.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Majority Never Has Right on its Side","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
