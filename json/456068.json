Schamoni kept on filming until just a few days before his death. The result was a moving and colourful chronicle amounting to a total of 170 hours of tape. Interspersing a selection of these images with excerpts from Schamoni’s films such as \"Es\" and \"Chapeau Claque\", Schamoni’s photographer daughter Ulrike Schamoni and editor Grete Jentzen have created a loving tribute to a generous and multifaceted man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dAPLqboPAWAz4adXSBbGNF2DLfW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abschied von den Fröschen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
