You'll see TD full of passion, strength and lady power. The very interesting merging of music, generic lights and full laser program has made this performance to a quite outstanding experience for those who could attend the concert. Especially for TD's diehard brigade it's a meal deluxe and hardly comparable to other moving pics from orange dreamland. Did you ever hear about the effectiveness of acoustic amphetamines -- here you have it!\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/56MVOlxuykBkXsE4kMm6BxmGd1e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live Open Air Concert July 2007","title":"Tangerine Dream - Orange Odyssey","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
