Also Oasis shows great views of the landscapes of the US south-west, most of them in time-lapse photography, combined with TD's music which sounds mostly rhythmic and sequencer-driven. As Canyon Dreams, this video was a result of a cooperation between TD and the US Camera One company. The pictures of an overwhelming nature were taken by Gray Warriner, who had already been director of Canyon Dreams, and by Ned Sickels in the most famous National Parks in the deserts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, among them Zion National Park, Canyon de Chelly, Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Petrified Forest, Cliff Dwellings and Cedar Breaks. The band's name is printed not onto the cover but only on a shiny silver star-shaped sticker on the cardboard sleeve - but this all does not affect the result of this great work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t87Zy1gAzRnq2lbqp1DUrZJtjto.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cam√©ra One","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Soundtrack, released March 1997","title":"Oasis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
