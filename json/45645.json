Known worldwide as a pioneer of women’s professional surfing, in the Islands Rell Sunn achieved the stature of an icon — not only for her physical power, grace and luminous beauty, but for her leadership in a community that loved her as much as she loved it. Named one of Hawai’i’s most influential women of the 20th century by ABC television, Sunn - whose Hawaiian name means Heart of the Sea - was eulogized in the New York Times for having “captured the heart of Hawai’i during a 14-year battle with cancer.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dK5phdiwXtS4r4C4Zkm9FDLPRTo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heart of the Sea: Kapolioka'ehukai","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
