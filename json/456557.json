They seduce everyone in sight - the maid, the owner/chef (Alban Ceray), a lone female guest (XNK2367), a guest couple (Charlie Schreiner and Myriam Watteau), but not (yet) the baker’s boy, and turn them all into sex maniacs, including the frustrated baker’s boy. This 'lad' (Vattier is a bit old for the part) spies an orgy going on inside the hotel and is driven to draw a female outline in the gravel of the drive and then make love to it. The hole he creates eventually becomes a fertility symbol site of scientific interest, attracting a couple of researchers to investigate it (Nadine Scant and a Charlie Schreiner near look-alike).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u3PSiK7cxgKwn8SXh5CnBgBx43o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9380,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tanagra Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":52389,"logo_path":null,"name":"F.F.C.M.","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crazy Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
