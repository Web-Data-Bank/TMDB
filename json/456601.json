Not one teacher could stand their riotous tactics... Until Tonie Santiago Came.

Tonie's teaching career was fast becoming a success. Her students paid attention to her and respected her. But it was different with Ford Jimenez, son of the university's owner. Instead of gaining respect for tonie, he developed an indecent obsession towards her. Ford cooked up a scheme to get just what he wanted and led to a campus scandal.
