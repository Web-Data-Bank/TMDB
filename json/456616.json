Because she is totally bored there and also wants to have fun and explore the world, she makes a pact with her father: she is allowed to go to earth for a week - but she has to convert a good person to evil there. If she succeeds in this challenge, she may stay on earth forever, otherwise she'll be waving a hell of a boring job in the bookkeeping of the underworld.","popularity":8.285,"poster_path":"/uz0NeJCLnWUNkzeL0bV2hfpbydk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":856,"logo_path":"/z0vTTWBhZggM09oZWSY3hbXgPKv.png","name":"Wild Bunch","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Be Really Bad","video":false,"vote_average":6.76,"vote_count":75}
