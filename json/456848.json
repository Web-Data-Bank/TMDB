He feels he does not fit in anywhere because he is an adopted child.  Patrick learns that Gerbert is also adopted, and the two of them talk about \"famous\" people in the Bible who were adopted, such as Moses.  Finally, Patrick discovers in a fresh and very personal way that God is his Father and we are all His \"adopted\" children.  \"Before My First Day Began...: was written primarily to offer comfort and insight to adopted children.  However, it also addresses the reality that we are all adopted into God's family.  This is a very honest, tender and helpful video for children (and families) of adoption.  We hope it will find it's way into church libraries, school counselor's offices, family therapists' and child psychologists' offices, and many other concerned and active organization in this area of counseling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/prczrbPebc0tQ12JR7izWmnWFHK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gerbert - Before My First Day Began...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
