Filmed in Trucolor, Stallion Canyon was the maiden effort from Kanab Productions, a Utah-based organization. Former Sons of the Pioneers vocalist Ken Curtis made his starring debut in this one, playing a ranch foreman who does his best to track down a rogue stallion. The rest of the cast is comprised of unknowns, save for villains Ted Adams and Forrest Taylor. Cheaply produced, Stallion Canyon has the twin advantages of a relatively new leading man and excellent location photography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eDQUr48t3gsHZJjgkHcBk5sfMlD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astor Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":90236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanab Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stallion Canyon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
