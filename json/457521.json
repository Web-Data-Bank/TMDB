The mysterious discovery of a lost papyrus containing the words to songs  unheard for 1700 years sends Margaret on a journey to discover the truth about Sappho. Was she indeed the first lesbian, a priestess, sex worker, a stern schoolmistress or an aristocratic lady of leisure as readers over the centuries have variously alleged? We ask how each generation’s view of the archetypal liberated woman of letters tells us as much about us and our fears as it does about her.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/zOZ6KNHEDbZMHPDdO9MPCrL8U7h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78524,"logo_path":"/mjGIRLCzcTLyQEYBic1Ofxc33My.png","name":"Maya Vision International","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sappho: Love and Life on Lesbos","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
