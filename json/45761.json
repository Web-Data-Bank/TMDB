Composed and arranged for a 60 piece Orchestra by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson feat. special guests Bilal, Dwele, Posdnuos, Talib Kweli and more. This premiere performance is still on the minds of many. Mixed and mastered by legendary Grammy award winning producer/mixer, Bob Power. The man behind hundreds of pop and jazz recordings for such artists as Erykah Badu, D'Angelo, De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest and more, he had also worked with Dilla while he was alive. Hiphop has never sounded or looked like this, welcome to a new era, a new scale and a new sound. Part of the proceeds of all Suite for Ma Dukes performances and recordings will go towards Maureen \"Ma Dukes\" Yancey and the heirs to the Dilla Estate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Orchestral Celebration of the Life and Music of James \"Dilla\" Yancey.","title":"Timeless: The Composer/Arranger Series (Suite for Ma Dukes)","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
