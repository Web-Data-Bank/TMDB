Some of those images are explicitly macho: we see various body-builders flexing their biceps and triceps. Other images seen here are not macho in the literal sense, but are indirectly related to testosterone or cojones on some level: we see military aircraft making bombing raids, and footage of car crashes.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/3LTOShYDSUrgJ5pTcofrXzi24bG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werner Herzog Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herakles","video":false,"vote_average":5.962,"vote_count":26}
