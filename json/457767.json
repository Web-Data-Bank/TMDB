A brilliant young pianist who in his youth expected him to climb to the top of world music and is now a dangerous and wanted criminal. A senior doctor in the hospital, a drug addict, who must wait patiently for surgery until his hands stop shaking. A young nurse whose parents, in which she nursed, abused her and lamented that she had to die in the place of her soldier brother. Everyone meets when a poor film producer arrives and invites the director out of the gutter and write a script for him. The film, as well as the screenplay written by the director, track these lost souls crossing each other's paths in the no-go paths in which they roam.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iEgRNmjVJle7D82blIfRBRNFFn1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Matter of Reputation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
