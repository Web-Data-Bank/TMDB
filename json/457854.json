The film's heroes, who want to conquer the musical Olympus of Moscow, are accompanied by both. This troika is not even a group yet, not a team, and probably not even friends. But that's at the beginning. The further the heroes leave home, the more dangerous their adventures and the people they met on the way become, and the more strongly the children change inside. The film is a journey, a search of the self, where the road to the dream is the greatest, most dangerous and unforgettable adventure in the life of the young provincial musicians.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sgCtMLsDu3RYXwuNsvWVTSZgGdZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77492,"logo_path":null,"name":"VGIK-Debut","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
