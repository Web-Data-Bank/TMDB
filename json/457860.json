At least that's what the local bowling clubs in idyllic Warroad, Minnesota used to say, before Emily came along. Now that she has returned to resurrect her name on the champion's board, Gunnar and the boys in town are polishing up their equipment for another shot at the title. This screwball ensemble mockumentary captures Emily's return from retirement, to avenge her loss to Gunnar, and bring justice to her family name. It's gutter-ball madness where split happens.","popularity":1.815,"poster_path":"/fdCLybIzlJBuhJhgTPRFPPpsvIC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90499,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nordic Tundra Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Split happens!","title":"12 Pound Balls","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
