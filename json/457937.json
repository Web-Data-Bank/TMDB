However, it is unconventional, both in terms of form and narrative structure. Jokinen is constructed from newspaper and book quotes as well as the artist’s own narration. Since the piece directly cites texts from the 1930s, it uses some language that is offensive from today’s perspective. By exposing a story from the 1930s, the artist asks whether there are any similarities in the present and the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bynidonQz2rVUmlH5ZZuH40GhdQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jokinen","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
