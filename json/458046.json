He raised funds, filmed Almada, interviewed him and worked on this multimedia project for several years, even after the artist's death. The result was a complex artistic work, with three simultaneous projections of slides and film, music by Jorge Peixinho and the incorporation of other projects by Ernesto de Sousa. In a text titled \"Anticinema\" he would write: \"i do not make a movie / about almada / i make a movie with almada\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/12DKmCknMwdooEudPNIjBkbdPcf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almada, Um Nome de Guerra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
