Witty, eclectic and insightful, this film is a journey through the most enduring subject for world sculpture, one that carves a path through politics and religion, the ancient and the modern.  Actor David Thewlis has his head sculpted by three different sculptors, while the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, artist Maggi Hambling and art critic Rachel Johnston discuss art's most enduring preoccupation, ourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uv4Dhcx1am6WUieH3px1Nk9O0Il.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Actor David Thewlis has his head sculpted by three different sculptors.","title":"How to Get a Head in Sculpture","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
