In retaliation, Drake frames Bill for a stage robbery committed by his own henchmen and arranges a phony trial presided over by the saloon's bartender Judge Whipple. Queenie interrupts the \"trial\" with the news that the townswomen have all elected Jim Marshal. To uphold the decision, Bill has secured the release of three convicted outlaws: Blackie Malone, Bad Bill Smith, and Shotgun Thompson, two of whom join in the fight against Drake and his gang.","popularity":1.127,"poster_path":"/p1cuFurj82B1qDPvxEOMkBmHp7K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Schwarz Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":75243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eagle-Lion Classics","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"GUNS SHOT FASTER...MEN DIED QUICKER...under the ice-cold gaze of a reckless, relentless beauty","title":"Cattle Queen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
