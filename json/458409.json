She is a woman trying to live and think independently. Marina finds herself in a world unknown to her, at once pure and immaculate, but with the signs of the deformation of natural life that is typical of the whole country. After meeting the Doctor, Bai Mnogoznai, Mariana, the mayor, the internationalist Yosko, she discovers that each resists authority in their own way. And when the government starts changing the non-Bulgarian names of the Pomak villagers, the heroine realizes she is in a prison - with high mountains, forests, rivers - a prison of tragic beauty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b5usXz0HPUAGv1VF75zv0ak1uSM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74701,"logo_path":"/tXlAkHJqG0Vf8fPnRPKwskEJlDK.png","name":"BNT","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1994-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burn, Burn, Little Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
