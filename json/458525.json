In the same vein, a lover, a mother, a friend, a few buddies, all orphans, all well-to-do, but mainly lost at sea without a ship. The lover : Paul, a lone wolf who tries to escape from his memories through drink or by chasing women as though they were the cure to everything. The best friend : Lucie, coming and going, suitcase in hand , as though she were carrying a corpse or a time bomb, ready to flee at the drop of a hat with her suitcase of course. The mother : Marthe. Between shovel and incinerator, she counts her dead, cat and husband included. And then, there is Lucien, madly running after Lucie, screeching guitar in hand. And the others, always running.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/xcdlLhWk3qCTYB3CnMfKZCArZnj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Ariane","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rupture(s)","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
