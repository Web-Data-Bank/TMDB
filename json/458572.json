The following stories in the show may or may not shed light on the inscription. Questions remain unanswered. The Residents study death, not as a horrific end, but as the ultimate question that we all ask while wondering if any of it is even real.\r Recorded April 16, 2011 at Bimbo's in San Francisco","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qsFwC6ztSOrmNFRWpXSMzmd7y4M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85159,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Cryptic Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Concert","title":"The Residents - Talking Light: Bimbo's","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
