Filmed over several years of two UFO buffs on their own personal search for the truth, 'Alien Highway' is about the people whose passionate obsession created a unique cultural phenomenon that flourished for a time in an obscure little community that happens to exist on the border of America's Twilight Zone.","popularity":0.913,"poster_path":"/tgwspdtGSJnGkbRuwrjmvlNY0s8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102902,"logo_path":null,"name":"Back of the Mind Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alien Highway","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
