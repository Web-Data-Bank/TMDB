It tells the story of several interrelated people who die in the collapse of an Inca rope-fiber suspension bridge in Peru, and the events that lead up to their being on the bridge. A friar who has witnessed the tragic accident then goes about inquiring into the lives of the victims, seeking some sort of cosmic answer to the question of why each had to die.","popularity":4.781,"poster_path":"/jp26f92Z28eFVmwZ90Q09bnrBEB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11391,"logo_path":"/t6m0uRTzaFHCsvEpikENE0PWJGb.png","name":"Tribeca Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pembridge PIctures","origin_country":""},{"id":7419,"logo_path":"/gz5Kdc138DEz93LvcppdBPuW1jV.png","name":"Scion Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1727,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movision","origin_country":""},{"id":1071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spice Factory","origin_country":""},{"id":342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Davis Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metropolitan Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8,"logo_path":"/78ilmDNTpdCfsakrsLqmAUkFTrO.png","name":"Fine Line Features","origin_country":""},{"id":4169,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanzaman Productions","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Five lives bound by one fate.","title":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":46}
