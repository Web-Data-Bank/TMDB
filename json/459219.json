Despite their confidence, the stark reality of being away from home brings a series of crises. Well trained in critical and metaphorical thinking, and unusually articulate about their inner lives, each of the protagonists guides us to his core. Since sixth grade, they have been part of an innovative mentoring program called 'Alchemy, Inc.' that uses mythological stories, drumming and writing. In the twice-yearly reunion workshops everyone speaks of his trials and his triumphs with authenticity, intelligence, honesty and heart. In turns quiet, thoughtful and exuberant, the six protagonists grow before our eyes, whether navigating racial provocations, or seeking support with new friends, estranged fathers and wise grandmothers.","popularity":0.974,"poster_path":"/d2bw5lnsstj2WBsq0SfvwyWsVtu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Karinafilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding the Gold Within","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":4}
