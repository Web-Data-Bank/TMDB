Changing light, reflections, moving shadows, and the undulating surface of the water dominate the film; images alternate between panoramic views of the port with its industrial plants and ships and close-up shots of bollards, quays, and individual parts of buildings. The calm images and the silence (the film lacks sound) convey a peaceful atmosphere that contrasts with the usually noisy industrial harbor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qnButRFErHAblw2zkAmJWFx6oso.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"X/78 Rheinhafen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
