As he wanders the city streets in the afternoons, the artist captures, without any preconceived intentions, urbans details, or micro-events that draw his attention. Mutzenbecher describes Rom 70/71 as \"reflex cinema\" and develops a spontaneous form of filmed diary about a location, in this case a city, without focusing on human presence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q26p8Tks6kn91t0ItBDQhBAUQsp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rom 70/71","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
