They discuss matters of faith, family, demureness, religion and being. Their quest is personal, it is about proving themselves, an initiation that lasts for the two-year period they spend away from home. The Elders and the Sisters, young Mormon missionaries, leave their country, study a different language and culture and become immersed in a spirit of mission. They aspire to be role models for the perfect boys and girls.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kxkqtDN7hEcRqIteHub0XnzE2vE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9047,"logo_path":"/a0oCybecb96ieZY4139hb9uqYs1.png","name":"Terratreme","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2009-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Latter-Day Saints","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
