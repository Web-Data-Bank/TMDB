For the past 10 years I lived in 7 countries, 10 cities, and 21 homes. I slept in 21 beds, cooked in 21 kitchens, cleaned 21 bathrooms, stared at 21 windows, wrote on 21 desks, and locked 21 doors behind me. I packed all of my life into two suitcases and a backpack. The rest stayed behind.  Somebody somewhere uses my bed, somebody somewhere has my shoes. I was there. But now I am here.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rdyyx8Qq6CjfAPIdRCmnskOcWNH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8152,"logo_path":"/shnLD1Pj9d1vB2TH93QHSNT5gzW.png","name":"DFI","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2016-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turtles Are Always Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
