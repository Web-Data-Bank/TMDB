This is his musical, social and sexual coming of age, when he discovered the power of his own sexuality before setting about turning that persona into a popstar. Set against a backdrop of social discord, disenfranchisement and sexual repression, the seventies was also conversely the decade that revelled in colour and creative chaos, giving the world glam rock, disco and punk, and the young George O'Dowd was at the birth of them all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c0ktIDYHZmSbfMvgTtH85VcgN9h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7710,"logo_path":"/iJQIjE9g4FqCDPLzxqoOfQ0e4Xx.png","name":"BBC One","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boy George's 1970s: Save Me From Suburbia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
