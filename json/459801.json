The Death of Michael Brown 9.8.2014","overview":"Hand-drawn animated short reconstructing, frame by frame, a brief section of mobile phone footage of Michael Brown, who was murdered by police in the city of Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Brown's body lay on the hot pavement for four hours after being killed; the film is an attempt to make some meaning of that time. By drawing and redrawing the mobile phone footage, time is reinvested into the image, as an homage and to add value. The frames have been worked over and over, causing the paper to tear and to rupture, almost resembling burning, recalling the violent protests and fires that broke out after the murder, as well as historical lynching fires.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live, moments ago.
