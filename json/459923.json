This anonymous hero is very ancient. Slowly the representatives that formerly symbolized families, groups, and orders disappear. We witness the advent of the number. It comes along with democracy, the large city, administrations, cybernetics. It is a flexible and continuous mass, woven tight like a fabric with neither rips nor darned patches, a multitude of quantified heroes who lose names and faces as they become the ciphered river of the streets, a mobile language of computations and rationalities that belong to no one.” (Michel de Certeau)","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/dprCf2cYIe3WWbJRG8aOfnrOTZj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2015-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every-one","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
