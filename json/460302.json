The Kinetophone was a fairly complex mechanical means of creating talking pictures. Unlike previous systems, in which actors would be required to lip sync to preexisting recordings on camera, the Kinetophone was one of the earliest film technologies to record sound at the same time as the image. More than 200 of these Kinetophones were produced between 1913 and 1914, but only a handful of the films and their accompanying sound cylinders survive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pPDFBH2xwViqinYAZwsE0d8mvY3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91053,"logo_path":null,"name":"The American Talking Picture Co., Inc.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Edison Kinetophone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
