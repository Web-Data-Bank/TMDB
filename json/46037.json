LIVE AT THE FILLMORE draws most heavily from that self-titled disc and the Los Angeles collective's 2004 outing, STREET SIGNS, with rock, funk, pop, and hip-hop elevated by the group's potent Latin rhythms. Ozomatli's performances do not disappoint; in fact, these tunes often outshine their studio counterparts, since they offer an added shot of spontaneity and energy. Ozomatli: Raúl Pacheco (vocals, guitars); Asdrubal Sierra (vocals, trumpet, keyboards); Justin \"El Niño\" Porée (rap vocals, percussion); Jabulani Smith-Freeman (rap vocals); Ulises Bella (clarinet, saxophone, keyboards, background vocals); Sheffer Bruton (trombone, background vocals); Wil-Dog Abers (electric bass, background vocals); Mario Calire (drums); Jiro Yamaguchi (tabla, percussion); DJ Spinobi (turntables).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ozomatli Live at the Filmore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
