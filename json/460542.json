You can here see and hear some of the actors he was going to use in his movies for the next years. The movie shows rehearsals for his play \"The Coffehouse\" which also became a television-movie, and you can watch unique footage from the 19th Film-Festival in Berlin (1969) where \"Love is Colder Than Death\" were shown. As told in this documentary, his first feature-movie were given a cold shoulder by many of the journalists and visitors at the festival. You can in \"End of the Commune\" watch Fassbinder and actor Ulli Lommel walk out on stage after the opening of \"Love is Colder than Death\", while a man in the audience is shouting \"Out with the director!\". In this interesting documentary Fassbinder also talks a lot about his father which was a respectable doctor.","popularity":1.137,"poster_path":"/8puJsLDsH7Uemxah27dWxNrLyUm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":210,"logo_path":"/cuIR8m2nnKkqPgnQz25FJT26aBa.png","name":"SÃ¼ddeutscher Rundfunk","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1970-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End of the Commune?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
