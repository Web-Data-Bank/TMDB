Reverberating between multi-media versions of the same events, playing with disjunctions between figure and ground, HEAD is a 'trickfilm' meditation on portraiture; the animator, as actor, lives through his drawings, which in turn become actors who influence his own self-image. An insider's diary on the process of creation, HEAD is a brilliant encyclopedic exploration of the circular relationship between the animator and his creation, of the nature of animated illusion itself.\"  -Thelma Schenkel, Millimeter","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cCjYSgzeiw9uvDOCNeKqM3xP0A7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative Artists Public Service Program","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
