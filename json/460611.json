Like many women of her generation, she does not work and takes care of her two children. But she longs for a different life while Gérard confuses the happiness of his family with the acquisition of household appliances. Trained by an old friend, Agnès, in family planning meetings, Clémence will meet a young philosophy teacher, Jérôme. For him, she will abandon her husband and her children, and try to live the utopia of a life of total freedom. Blinded by his pain, a stranger to his wife's questioning, Gérard will have to become aware of the upheavals that will overwhelm society a few months later. Life will never be the same again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b6KRS4yEMFDYbPG5oIY40wjO1SZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2901,"logo_path":null,"name":"ADR Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les vacances de Clémence","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
