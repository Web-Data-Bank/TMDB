The year is 1947, a tumultuous period as tensions rise between the Israeli settlement and the Arab tribes and neighboring countries. A chance encounter sparks love at first sight between Margalit, of Nahalal – a cooperative workers' settlement – and Eli Ben-Zvi, the Muhtar of the Beit Keshet kibbutz. The affair is off to a rocky start, as Eli is committed to the defense efforts that preceded the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 and the birth of the State of Israel. The two go on to set a wedding date, but the fight for a nation leaves no room for young lovers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hoXSZoafwku4aZJKejrDWIT3joh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hameragel Haboded Films","origin_country":""},{"id":22231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Israel Film Fund","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2017-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Israeli Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
