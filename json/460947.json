She picks the maggots off her father’s face and has forced sex with her uncle on the hard wooden floor beneath the bed upon which her father still lays. Finally, she manages to kill her torturer. Leaving home for the first time of her life, she meets Hideki who struggles with his psychological chaos. He finds her torturing herself because of her trauma, and then he sacrifices himself for his “blood action painting” to share her sorrow and pain. They shut themselves up in the atelier and get absorbed in having sex. Realizing the blood rules their emotion and desire, they decide to cut their bodies and suck each other’s blood. They believe they will be spiritually one after connecting deeply enough.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hYwmdR7vuc11ci8PxcgenrakMUE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Runs Faster Than Blood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
