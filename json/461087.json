Subtitles translate their utterances while the screen remains black. Neither silent nor a movie in the conventional sense, this work provides the framework for the audience to reflect on the speakers and the conditions that may have prompted the loss of their language. These silenced speakers buried in archives, have literally been given voice again by the artist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wSi3QEes78o1okqsTGojNSP0sT4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Silent Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
