Whether he's driving an orange Porsche to his cliff-top Monaco mansion, ordering martinis or looking suave in a designer suit, he is a man on a mission. It isn't to hunt down SPECTRE, but to find perfection in everything he does. Whether it's performing on stage, recording albums, or selecting a suit, Charlie demands the best, of himself and others. Despite an entourage dubbed ‘Charlie's Angels', he's lonesome, and complains that people can't relate to him. Danish filmmaker Eva Mulvad, with patience and panache, delves into this life of privilege to find commonalities of ambition and desire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/B5X54wVUy2gTO20IB2AYauK0ib.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danish Documentary","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2017-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every Note Matters, Every Detail Counts.
