La belle dame sans merci follows a famous actress who was once seduced and abandoned by a rich man and subsequently resolved to become a “merciless woman,” forever scheming to hurt others (men in particular) in a ruthless yet captivating manner. Dulac challenges the Romantic archetype embodied in Keats’s poem by way of symbolist mise en scène, self-reflexive narration, and her typically associative approach to editing, locating a modern ambiguity within the stereotypical figures of 19th-century art.\" - Film Society of Lincoln Center","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3LJboSE4lhz2uuJvZ9Be2dbThCl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91191,"logo_path":null,"name":"D.H.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1921-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beautiful Woman Without Mercy","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
