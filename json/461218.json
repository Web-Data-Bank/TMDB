Part 'normal' child, part science experiment, William’s 'parents' struggle with the best way to raise him. As William grows toward adulthood, he is educated in the human experiences of love and intimacy. But his primitive impulses begin to emerge the more he tries to conform to human expectations, leading to tragic consequences for him and his loved ones.","popularity":2.581,"poster_path":"/yEHCfZHVstvFExr067N22AWjfQk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148662,"logo_path":null,"name":"William Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes your past is a mystery","title":"William","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7}
