It is a celebration of my fatherâ€™s life, a meditation on his body and a visual record of mourning. When my father died, there was never a chance to see his body after life had left it. This film was made by placing his ashes directly on 35mm film in a dark room and moving the film a frame at a time. What we see in this process of photograming is not the object in the photographic sense, but instead a representation of the space surrounding an object. The photogram is a shadow charting the distance between things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/46c5KibmKNHTkqnYJrPICapCJcZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wake","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
