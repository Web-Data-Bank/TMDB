After making a diverse group of films in the 80s, he reunited with Robert DeNiro for \"Goodfellas\" and later that year shot a segment for \"New York Stories\", an anthology film of three shorts by Scorsese, Woody Allen, and Francis Ford Coppola. During the editing, the French documentary series \"Cin√©ma, de notre temps\" filmed a documentary on the director, and it's a fascinating glimpse into his life, personality, and working habits as he edits his short with long-time collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker.","popularity":0.674,"poster_path":"/bLFI6P0vGp2vSD3ZianPVnxSI3p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scorsese Machine","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
