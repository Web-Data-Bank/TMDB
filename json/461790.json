It was considered to be the hardest climbing route in the world and perhaps impossible for a human.  Nalle Hukkataival, a strong Finnish climber took up the challenge. It required almost four years of total commitment and his efforts were followed by hundreds of thousands of climbers around the world.  When Nalle finally succeeded, it blew away the whole climbing world like nothing before. The first 9A boulder was climbed!  The documentary follows Nalle's journey from the very beginning, all the way to the first ascent almost half a decade later. It captures the incredible dedication that was needed to deal with all the variables and to take that last step to open the next level of climbing.","popularity":0.637,"poster_path":"/paa7xLalHebqxRbF87kDBXLgFls.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Kangoo Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Documentary About Not Giving Up","title":"The Lappnor Project","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
