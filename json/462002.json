Having decided he has accumulated all he can of conventional knowledge, Doctor Faustus turns to magic in a quest for greater truths. Before long, he ends up selling his soul to the devil – the famous “Faustian pact” that has entered everyday language. Dr Faustus gradually realizes his terrible mistake. He apparently repents, but finally dies, the devil coming to collect his soul, and his friends the dismembered body.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6pbiDmuRoWfAatym1GhLXVLgrFf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stage \u0026 Screen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Recorded Live at Greenwich Theatre","title":"Doctor Faustus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
