The film documents a pilgrimage in memory of Edith Swan Neck. The 108 mile journey, as the crow flies, allows the audience to reflect upon all things Edith. A conversation in Northampton between Alan Moore, Iain Sinclair and Edith Swan Neck is also a key element to the unfolding 'story'. With images shot using digital super 8 iPhone's and sound recorded using a specially constructed music box with a boom microphone the film unfolds chronologically but in a completely unpredictable way. The numerous encounters and impromptu performances en route are proof, as if needed, that the angels of happenstance were to looking down upon the troop, with EDITH as their hallucination","popularity":3.071,"poster_path":"/1ExGsz7R9qJP7x54Gmpn1KsCexX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edith Walks","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
