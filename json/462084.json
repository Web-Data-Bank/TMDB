André was a Russian aristocrat who spent his early years working and studying all around Europe before going to Napa Valley, California, where his life was filled with both tragedy and success as he helped to move the Californian wine industry from a virtually moribund state after the repeal of Prohibition. He had a direct impact on the 1976 Paris blind tasting, known as the ‘Judgement of Paris’, staged by Steven Spurrier which turned the world of wine upside down. André was not a businessman, but an artist and scientist whose heart and soul were devoted to wine. His philosophy about life and his love for wine continues to influence generations of wine makers throughout the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t6dmUkTYEkIRcNPli5E8wadtLjA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"André: The Voice of Wine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
