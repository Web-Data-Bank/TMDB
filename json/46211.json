With kindness and gentle humour, the film reveals the relationship between the older and the younger generation. The original concept of a short film study with authentic characters of the Ravager family grew into a feature-length picture on the border between a documentary and fiction. It was made as an improvisation without a previously approved screenplay in the course of only twenty days.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Štúdio hraných filmov Bratislava","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Daily Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
