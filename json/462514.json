It was to be purely structural. For sound I recorded (in sync) the quiet ambience of my Val Verde neighborhood. Then I decided to add the sounds of a radio playing. I set up my Sound Devices and began to record NPRâ€™s All Things Considered. It was 3:00pm on December 2. The regular news was interrupted by breaking news from San Bernardino. By the end of my recording 12 people were dead along with two suspects. My film is no longer purely structural.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fresh Air","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
