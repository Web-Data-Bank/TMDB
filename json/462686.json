The 64-minute documentary eschews much of the tabloid sensationalism that shrouded the genre in the early to mid-'90s, focusing instead on the music itself, an element thus far overlooked by the mainstream media.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5qrSoPHuMnJm5qKSEu4iBwFx8D0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder Music: Black Metal","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
