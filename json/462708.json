Featuring music by Malaria, Reflections, Einstürzende Neubauten, Frieder Butzmann and Die Tödliche Doris. It’s a hit or miss affair with films that range from the brilliant to the banal. Well worth watching for the flashes of genius.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p5KbOwhztqmHWyiiHsJmuHCKg2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin Super 80","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
