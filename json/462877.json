This hypnotic, visually and sonically immersive exploration of a haunted space unfolds in two parts. In the first, a woman (Eadaoin Oâ€™Donoghue) dissolves her identity into the ghostly resonances she finds in the rooms and corridors of a sprawling, atmospheric seaside basement property. In the second, a man (Rashidi), existing in a parallel dimension of the same space, pursues a bizarre and perverse amorous obsession.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8T8XkVOPJR0MksmVxWEf8NVXNG1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91599,"logo_path":null,"name":"Close Watch","origin_country":""},{"id":25385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Experimental Film Society","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weird Weird Movie Kids Do Not Watch The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
