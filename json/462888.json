Following the leads of artistic advisor Tony Bevan, it retraces the road that leads from its emergence and emancipation from the various free music movements of the 1960s to the recent surge in popularity as talented new players are coming to the fore. In his search for the Britishness of British Free Improvised Music, Prum and Bevan are assisted by stand-up comedian and Derek Bailey expert Stewart Lee, who converses with musicians from different generations and backgrounds to uncover the specifics of a genre that refutes the very notion of genre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2tDC3Vlkl29RX1wj4Rm5tuOl3YF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92442,"logo_path":null,"name":"NI-VU-NI-CONNU","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Conversations with British Improvisers","title":"Taking the Dog for a Walk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
