Filmmaker Evelyn Lambart uses glowing zinc cut-outs to give this traditional tale a contemporary twist. Akin to a joyful medieval manuscript, the film is embellished by the artist's own whimsyâ€”heraldic trumpet sounds, luminescent light, and wildflowers in every scene tell the message of rebirth. A film without dialogue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/84tb5qRWjCTMh7JKT6hZ2j2Ifhr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1973-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
