She pauses to think about the family she will leave behind: a completely helpless husband, a kind son who cares about nothing except his mother, and a daughter too busy to attend to anything but her own affairs. Soon-ok begins to prepare a gift for her family -- the opportunity to bring them together for a final farewell. Once fractured and separated, the family comes to learn that death does not have to be the antithesis of life, but can be its affirmation and awakening.","popularity":1.379,"poster_path":"/qBlsukahGMIe0HsmJOkdSwaxyNJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6944,"logo_path":"/jx8c0sSDzzORq9HjtGRyFtG289Q.png","name":"Pancinema","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":20064,"logo_path":"/2In7Heq6DuXDjOwPmJqHWkpohaL.png","name":"Next Entertainment World","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2012-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spring, Snow","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
