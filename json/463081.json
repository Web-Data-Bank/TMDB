The video repeats the crumpling and subsequent straightening of the pages, highlighting a ceaseless cycle. As each page is slowly crumpled time and again, the imagery fades, and we are left with the imprint on the artist’s hands—the result of repetitive contact and the residual accumulation of heat and information.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
