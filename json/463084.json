Acclaimed Fokofpolisiekar and African Cypher director (and two-time Encounters Audience Award winner) Little recruited musicians, sculptors, artists, a coastal forager, underwater wildlife filmmakers, conservation biologists, drone pilots â€“ to spend 10 days and nights at a camp site where they surfed, created artworks, and worked with the local community, celebrating that coast and ocean. Surfing the line between fiction and non, this strangely surreal dreamscape is an invigorating dip into the stream of consciousness of an eccentric and wildly talented bunch.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j3MtFWzwmiuVOwWWIC1YSuToea4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An ode to the weskus (west coast)","title":"Deep Blue / Middle C","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
