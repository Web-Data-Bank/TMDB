During the mating season, the lyrebird sings a mixture of its own tunes and those of other birds for hours on end. With the encroachment of humans upon its habitat, the birds have been exposed to new sounds, and they have been known to incorporate into their songs noises such as car alarms, camera shutters and even the sound of a chain saw starting up. It is therefore the only animal that incorporates the sounds of its own environmentâ€™s gradual extinction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mimesis as Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
