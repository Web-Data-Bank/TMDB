Paying homage to a 1930s urban myth about a ghost that haunted the Old City of Jerusalem, the film records how an elderly woman, currently living where the fable is set, secures her home and family heritage by leading life in confined quarters, often at the expense of her own livelihood and health. The work also features footage of a ‘tunnel cemetery’ being constructed to house 22,000 displaced corpses. Many of the Palestinian workers who dig these makeshift graves enter Jerusalem without proper permitting, their illegal movement enabled by the dead’s historical presence. While these tunnels are created to house the remains of those who have passed, the presence of those remains preserves a channel of movement, one hidden underneath the city and expanding without tangible oversight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30KG Shine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
