The open unfolding structure, which pulls away from the balanced design of much of my work, gives equal weight to the sound composition. Involves \"opening\" with its perils and ambiguities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9EDBPvO2GtKdcqbPev0OmFCq7V4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Thread","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
