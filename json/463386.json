In 2016 I travelled to 7 towns across Iceland and collaborated with 7 local artists to create, record and perform a new composition. For 7 weeks we released a brand new song and live video every Monday.  Alongside the performances we made this film, Island Songs, where we explore what makes these artists tick, the influence the country has had on their lives and try to show a different side of this island we all call home.","popularity":0.878,"poster_path":"/rtlf4THi5gMFEg44rh12zp5LKYg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island Songs","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
