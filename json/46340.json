But is all that changing? For the first time, science and religion have come together to uncover an age-old mystery: Who was Jesus Christ? What did he actually look like? And can the story of his death and resurrection now be proven as true? Is it possible that a single fiber from an ancient artifact might hold the answers? And has science found a way to unlock the hidden information contained in the artifact that could provide a link to the past-one that might explain the universe in a whole new light and give hope to people around the world.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fabric of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
