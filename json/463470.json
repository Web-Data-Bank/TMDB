All of this was Brodsky's Leningrad. The biography, which was written for, in Akhmatova's words, \"our red-head\". On the fourth of June 1972, when the plane carrying Brodsky took off from Pulkovo airport, this biography ended. And a new life began that almost no one in his homeland is aware of. Russia, America, Italy, Sweden, Finland - the filmmakers have traced the journey of their hero, perhaps the most well-traveled of all Russian writers. The places, that became his biography. And the people, that defined his fate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rQwTgFBw2QElY7iQSKWyEQrlUEd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brodsky Is Not a Poet","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
