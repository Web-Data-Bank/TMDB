There is a young leftist idealist, a city councilperson who is fighting real estate speculation. This is the portrait of Latina and its inhabitants. This province is certainly an anomaly, but is not so far from the present-day times that all of Italy is going through now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8T2S1hMSIUPNIZYSlnlqtagwUyz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2441,"logo_path":"/7Vutdea75apwXkRyfQ4Ne6j0KcN.png","name":"Fandango","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Latina/Littoria","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
