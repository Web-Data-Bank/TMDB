I had but one idea: to return to Beirut as quickly as possible and to begin shooting a film, for historical moments were taking place. This film became indispensible: to film so that history would cease repeating itself and to build up a picture library for future generations. I never understood why so few films were made during the Lebanese Civil War. Apart from the odd film, nothing remains from that time. The war surely merited more attention.\" (WaÃ«l Noureddine)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2006-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"July Trip","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
