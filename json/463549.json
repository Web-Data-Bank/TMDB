With exclusive access to the archive of the show, DICK CAVETT’S WATERGATE documents the scandal in the words of the people who lived it: from the botched burglary at the Democratic National Headquarters; to the must-see TV of the daily Congressional Watergate hearings; to the ongoing behind-the-scenes battle between the White House and “The Dick Cavett Show,” culminating with the resignation of President Nixon on August 9, 1974. DICK CAVETT’S WATERGATE offers a unique opportunity to mark the 40th anniversary of a defining moment in American history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8AKXfwHtmnazABdUURAk1E3l1Bs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crew Neck Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":91795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daphne Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10492,"logo_path":"/3fcHNVpW66wgG6o0cgFJlcP8cCg.png","name":"Thirteen","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Revisit the Watergate drama through the lens of Dick Cavett.","title":"Dick Cavett's Watergate","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
