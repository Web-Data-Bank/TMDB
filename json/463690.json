Adored by adults and children alike, at four she already led at the Box Office - ahead of Gable and Cooper. Her films saved a movie studio from bankruptcy, and a President credited her with raising the morale of Depression-weary Americans. Her earliest movies gave a foretaste of her talents and soon would become the songs and dances that helped make those movies immortal. Here she is at her heart-stirring best in films like Little Miss Marker, Now And Forever, The Little Princess, and The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8fPBQRcBbN5Xp42h5DYdkDcJXxm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shirley Temple: America's Little Darling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
