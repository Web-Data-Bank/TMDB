He used to love to party, make music, and let himself drift through Berlin. Then six years ago, he suddenly became a Muslim. He broke off contact with his old friends and his old ways. Now as a Salafi, every question has an answer by the rules of fundamental Islam. By filming him, I go in search of our lost bond of brotherly love and suddenly find myself on a journey with him, that goes beyond a religious exploration.\" - Eli Roland Sachs","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9EfVvcqEaEecEqp7HT6fTHx4pht.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brother Jakob","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
