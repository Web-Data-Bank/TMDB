Back in the 1980’s they made powerful, skewed pop music with keyboardist Lee Stephens under the name “From Nursery To Misery”; self-releasing scores of cassettes from their bedroom in Essex. They also toured around Europe and posed on the cover of Psychic TV’s Hex Sex on the way. Now in their forties, and living a life of self-imposed isolation, the film tells the unlikely story of the band’s short existence, before picking up the thread of the twins’ eccentric life together now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hjb9K6Z1BRROirUlbmszV3JoWZd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about Gina and Tina Fear","title":"From Nursery to Misery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
