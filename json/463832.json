Morissot, who is bored, hungry, and depressed, is walking along the boulevard when by chance he bumps into an old friend, Monsieur Sauvage, with whom he used to go fishing before the war. The two old friends reminisce over several glasses of absinthe in a café;, talking wistfully of the pleasant Sunday afternoons they used to spend fishing on the banks of the Seine before the war. Tipsy from the absinthe, the friends, for want of anything else to do, decide to go fishing in their old spot, and having obtained a laissez-passer from their officer, walk along the river to Argenteuil, a few miles west of the city, in the no man's land between the French and Prussian lines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j3Jftj7jxLqIpCN8Ytqq3HjSAwd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Azur","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
