The director is obsessed by filming marginal events in life. The closer he can get to these events with his camera, the more he becomes involved with them. In the end he falls victim to them. The film, with no dialogue and hardly any sound, is an experimental meditation on the complex, continually-changing relationship between a film-maker and his subject.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/de1rYGTvGIUFEblYDf7kHmMGUPi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mzhalala Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wooden Room","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":0}
