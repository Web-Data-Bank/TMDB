At its narrative core is the Ditrupa, a celebration of military history held in Markapanstad, rural North-West â€“ a filtered-down appropriation of Scottish tradition brought back by black South African troops who served in the Great War. As well as covering black military history, the film provides a telling juxtaposition of black memory against white history. Its portraiture of the craft and history of Diturupa, it needles in on an uncomfortable nostalgia that may be a basis of inquiry for future films on the subject.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qhJuRbi5ryeWbmq0ni7zrNBAXQw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Troupes of War: Diturupa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
