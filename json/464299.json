A son tells his mother an innocent lie as an excuse. We've all covered things up, but what happens when the consequences begin to snowball, and every minute it becomes harder and harder to take back the lie. Little Secret is inspired by a true story that happened in April 2012 in the Czech Republic and became a national scandal and media sensation for weeks. It started a huge racist backlash in the country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/txYBtmTEYfseE9vSAO8grteP1lP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34312,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stink Films","origin_country":""},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2013-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Secret","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
