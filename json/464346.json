This method of threading is used in Iranian culture and it has been a part of my upbringing since a young age. It is also a female bonding ritual, one in which I share with the women in my life and it is typically performed in a private space. This space is commonly reserved for story sharing and dialogue. I attempt to bring the viewer into intimate contact with acts that are usually performed in private; I attempt to create feelings of closeness and familiarity. My performance becomes an offer of intimacy and access.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sound of Strings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
