The Southern bands making what we'd now call 'indie' music in the 1980s were as equally in debt to punk rock, new wave, and Big Star, as they were to Southern culture and traditions. Their Southern identity, which was sometimes accepted and embraced only reluctantly so, and geographical roots deeply affected the route these bands and their local scenes took. Their sound, spirit, style, and careers were all shaped by being from the South. The bands of the Southern underground scene were fearless, innovative, original, and are enduringly influential and relevant in today's musical climate. Hopefully now they will be more than mere footnotes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2AwfQbSGKN4dLVLbsZO4Q06HQzp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Didn't Get Famous: The Story of the Southern Music Underground 1978-1990","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
