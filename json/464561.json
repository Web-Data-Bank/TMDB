With nowhere to turn, this city boy finds shelter at the home of a colorful local named Vova. With Vova as his guide, Lukas is confronted by a universe beyond his imagination, one in which life seems utterly detached from any identifiable structure. Fascinated by his host and his host's daughter Marushka, with whom he is rapidly falling in love, Lukas’s contempt for provincial life slowly melts away and sets him on a quest for a happiness he had never known could exist.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/ysfpPeMac3M87wRHb0oxDnqMufk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76761,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tato Film","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":79145,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elemag Pictures GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"MC","name":"Monaco"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2018-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volcano","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":15}
