The film is dedicated to his daughter Andrea and to his friend and collaborator Danny Seymour, both deceased. Life Dances On is composed of delicately balanced, intuitive moments that merge Frank’s own sense of loss for two people close to him with several filmed portraits of those who share his life, including his family and people on the street in New York City.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Dances On...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
