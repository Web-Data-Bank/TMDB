Nonetheless the film is in no sense an animation work but rather a collection of mostly un-nameable shapes which gather round this recognizable iconography and visually dominate the image which repeats its, thus, ephemeral chase-and-catch increasingly closer, finally obliterating all but the \"jewels,\" the multiple coloring, referred to in the title.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fWouPlVJt9W1yK8bH9MA3JYNOS9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lion and the Zebra Make God's Raw Jewels","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
