In an attempt to put an end to Bruno and Boots high jinks, he declares that they are to be separated; no shared classes and, most certainly, no shared dorm room. This punishment is worse than anything the boys could have imagined. However, if Bruno and Boots can alienate every boy in Dormitory 3, Sturgeon will be forced to re-unite them. The plot almost succeeds, but one misstep forces the girls from the Scrimmage Academy for Education and Awakening to move into Macdonald Hall, leaving Bruno and Boots back where they started.","popularity":2.577,"poster_path":"/g36WNjJv1WeK6JhdQD7YpzaJjKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aircraft Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruno & Boots: This Can't Be Happening at Macdonald Hall","video":false,"vote_average":6.386,"vote_count":35}
