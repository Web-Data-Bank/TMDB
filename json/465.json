She's self-aware and holds her own in a café conversation with a concert pianist she meets, but she has a wild streak and she's testing her powers over men, finding that she doesn't always control her moods or actions, and she's impatient with being a virgin. She sets off with her brother to a disco, latching onto an aging playboy who is himself hot and cold to her. She is ambivalent about losing her virginity that night, willing the next, and determined by the third.","popularity":2.626,"poster_path":"/8ClbHCNKkTQggKLKFUVLLVVokdV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":243,"logo_path":null,"name":"CB Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":244,"logo_path":null,"name":"French Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1988-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"36 Fillette","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":24}
