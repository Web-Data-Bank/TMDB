Titus is a ruler exhausted by war and loss, who relinquishes power but leaves Rome in disorder. Rape, cannibalism and severed body parts fill the moral void at the heart of this corrupt society. Shakespeareas gory revenge tragedy presents us with murder as entertainment, and, as the body count piles up, poses questions about the nature of sexuality, family, class and society.","popularity":1.442,"poster_path":"/e1AeQw3mt4dNlKaqS7DtxroEob1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal Shakespeare Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RSC Live: Titus Andronicus","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
