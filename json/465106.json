A virtual, two-dimensional anaglyph flickers in red and green, unfolding a visual space true to the Brehmian aesthetic. Concentratedly condensed collisions occur between everyday life and the world, being and performing, symbols and icons. A human skull, human bodies, Castle Grafenegg as an architectonic stand-in for the uncanny ... Sex and crime, art and pop culture flicker at pixilated speed – the stuff of dreams – most penetrating however brief. The mundane alternates with the fetish, glimpsed in the blink of an eye, intersected by a long drag on a Chesterfield cigarette while the full-bodied, tube-amped slow-motion reverb sound of a guitar swings in the background.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":67822,"logo_path":null,"name":"sixpackfilm","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2017-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"INSIDE - The Colour Version","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
