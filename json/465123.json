Yes, the cop they call Samurai has travelled to Los Angeles from a faraway land they call San Diego. Because it would just make no sense to have the movie take place in San Diego, or to have the cop be from LA to start with. Or, y’know, Japan.  Decapitations, explosions, poorly subbed in stunt doubles, mangled dialogue, prominent lion heads, and unfortunate banana hammocks abound in this extremely eighties-y nineties movie. Join Mike, Kevin, Bill, and Alfonso Rafael Federico Sebastian for Samurai Cop.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/whPe9uh4ca2sOmnbnhNuTQAYMiC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rifftrax Live: Samurai Cop","video":true,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
