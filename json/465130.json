Accompanied by a moody soundtrack, the piece opens with a black-and-white shot of the architectural facade. Superimposed over the house, the silhouette of a gunfighter fills the frame, alluding to the Winchester legacy. As the film unfolds, both mansion and rifleman are eclipsed by veils of saturated color and kinetic abstractions. Painterly shapes resembling gunshot wounds morph into Rorschach–like inkblots and back again into rifle–bearing specters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winchester","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
