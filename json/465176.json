Every day, through binoculars from his friend's window, he sees a young girl in front of her home. Although attractive, the woman's face has been badly scarred. He finds out her phone number and the two engage in pleasant conversation. He gets up enough nerve to ask to meet her in person, but the socially inept young man becomes paralyzed with fear. He again summons the courage to meet with her before he is plagued with fear once again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nCjfaqO2Q8smdMID24faGuO0sxX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Nouvelle Pathé Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1968-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl Across the Way","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
