Ranging from the revisiting of a scene of Ming-Liang Tsai's 'Vive l'Amour' through the eyes of its protagonist, to a ticker-tape parade in Buenos Aires, from a reflection on the filmic qualities of Brasilia,to an observation of the observers of the 1999 eclipse in Paris. All soundtracked by a sensitive balance of field-recordings and carefully chosen delicate music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Park Central","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
