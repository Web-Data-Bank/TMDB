There are as many different interpretations of that bleak past as there are countries affected. It is therefore hard to expect absolute harmony when, less than two decades since the war ended, a diverse group of veterans gathers at a remote mountain hotel for a therapy session over several days. On the contrary, such a dangerously volatile situation can suddenly ignite by just one thoughtless word, or a seemingly dirty look. That’s because the former soldiers, obstinately holding on to their fundamental masculinity and their prejudices, refusing to expose the inhumanity of the atrocities perpetrated. However, this quietness is just about to be broken and hidden emotions are to be faced.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/n53Elz6bPG9AoYMtOYdUg843trl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deblokada Produkcija","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2017-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men Don't Cry","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":10}
