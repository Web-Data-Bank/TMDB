Ouroboros, the symbol of the snake eating its tail, is both end and beginning: death as regeneration. A 74-minute experimental narrative film that turns the destruction of Gaza into a story of heartbreak, Ouroboros asks what it means to be human when humanity has failed. Taking the form of a love story, the film's central character is Diego Marcon, a man who embarks on a circular journey to shed his pain only to experience it, again and again. In the course of a single day, his travel fuses together Native American territories, the ancient Italian city of Matera, a castle in Brittany, and the ruins of the Gaza Strip into a single landscape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/37W4z9dkK77OTLMbDO9KvVADxXX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arab Fund for Arts and Culture","origin_country":""},{"id":92259,"logo_path":null,"name":"Idioms Film","origin_country":""},{"id":38063,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Digital Artist (IDA)","origin_country":""},{"id":51654,"logo_path":"/qTkVCfQFiM0q9sYn9pXKOsZdH2B.png","name":"Momento Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2017-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Death as birth, history as the present, the end as the beginning.","title":"Ouroboros","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
