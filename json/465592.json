The tape begins with Jonas, like Narcissus, leaning over a reflecting pool. Throughout this lyrical exercise, the viewer sees only reflected images and inversions, disturbances of the water's surface. Figures walking at the edge of the pool are seen as abstracted shimmers, upside down and backwards; shadowy figures move underwater and swim through the pool as in a choreographed dance. This simply rendered, evocative work is a phenomenological study of reflection, as Jonas draws a parallel between the spatial and mirroring effects of water and video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bWXHiUVMQzlJXvxpmwgwB7bvCBt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disturbances","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
