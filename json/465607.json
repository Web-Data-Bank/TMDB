The creators of the film - Esther Turan and Anna Koltay - wanted to explore what were the major youth music subcultures in the '90s and 2000s in Budapest. This film is a tribute to the underground subcultures of the city. In these series of films, these grass-roots groups deal with the social impact of their community building power and the role played by Budapest itself in the formation of these groups. The film explores the kind of atmosphere and unwritten rules, what were the dominant places, external signs, and symbols, or who were the central figures and what were the memorable stories. The film guides the viewer from the best bands to the message, from the typical attire to the cult bars. The new generation is a starting point, a complex retrospective of where it originated and why the colorful underground cultural life still characterizes Budapest today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2tuq81q3Kf1Lkh28ZKjeUH0IGdR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BP Underground - Hardcore / Punk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
