It is the richest and most beautiful land in the world. From a height, this land looks like a piece of felt, from close up like a clean and tiny park. The footpaths are lined with benches and the streets with banks. Alfred and Julia have been married for 8 years, are childless, and live on the 16th floor of a new building. Thanks to their various crises, they have got to know each other somewhat better, but their most outstanding characteristic remains their mediocrity. On Friday, August 12th 1977, a mysterious epidemic breaks out in their country. The mass media ensure that the news is widely broadcast. The authorities order a ban on information, but those concerned break their imposed silence. On Sunday evening, it becomes known that the epidemic was nomore than a kind of \"dress rehearsal\" for a real emergency. Alfred and Julia continue to live in a land of pure invention - but now they are conscious of the fact.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wBLhnrncgqZUaFpWKVCcjir04GU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4225,"logo_path":"/8A0FNCn3KX6sVdvQzF1Ncbby3gj.png","name":"Langfilm","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":117811,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nemo Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zones","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2}
