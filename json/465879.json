In the re-make Kötting's protagonist is a woman moving very slowly within the almost identical landscape to exactly the same soundtrack. Married up shot for shot with the original super 8 footage, Kötting sees the work as a digital artefact dug up and re-presented 33 years after the event.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7IQaOo8xbpVrlQB2lSs5HwCnaLd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klipperty Klöpp 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
