Mike, Bill, and Kevin riffed this spooky midnight-movie cult classic live in Nashville, and now it's available for you to download or stream in Anywhere-Ville!  When young Mary survives a horrible car crash, she tries to start her life over with a new church organist job in a small Utah town, as one does. But along the way she’s haunted by a gaunt pale figure in a nice suit who leads her to an abandoned old pavilion on the shores of the Great Salt Lake. Soon Mary doesn’t know if she’s awake or dreaming, alive or dead, which makes her really dull at parties. Fans of Rifftrax Live: Night of the Living Dead will love this one. Weird, creepy and very silly, our live riff of Carnival of Souls is not to be missed!","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/28oK27DLiM9lchtEcWVtnHdynnL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rifftrax Live: Carnival of Souls","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":3}
