At thirty-two years old, and still living with his parents, Buzz's adult life seems to be nothing more than a continuous haze of debauchery. That is until his carefree recklessness lands his lifelong friend in the hospital after another of his drunken mishaps. Faced with the reality of his choices as he reluctantly forces himself into sobriety, Buzz begins to realize just how much pain he has caused to those around him. With the help of a young Inupiaq boy (D'Artagnon Moonin), and an elderly, life-long alcoholic (Thomas G. Jacobs), Buzz must face his past, present, and possible future in order to take his life back from the bottle, and above all else, seek forgiveness not only from those he has wronged, but from himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tgzt8Htod3Hl0R1GPSvHFMKLKeh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Proper Binge","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
