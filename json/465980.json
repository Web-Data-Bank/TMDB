It is the White Continent... Antarctica.  Featuring the Antarctica Peninsula, South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, Antarctica Dreaming documents all major Antarctic and sub-Antarctic animals. Their lifecycles captured over an entire season of varying climate conditions, from wild white blizzards to fire red sunsets reflected in a glassy sea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1Azlcm5GUvbOUToNJOIXRkfbv6O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wildlife on Ice","title":"Antarctica Dreaming","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
