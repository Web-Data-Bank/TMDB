Without these Spitfire Women the war may never have been won. These trailblazers were part of the Air Transport Auxillary, a thousand-strong organisation that delivered aircraft to the frontline RAF during Britain's darkest hours. Every day, responsibility fell on their shoulders to get the planes to the fighters which often pushed them into dangerous and even deadly situations. Using interviews with the last few surviving veterans, archive footage and dramatic reconstruction, this documentary brings to life the forgotten story of the ATA. The resilience of these women in the face of open discrimination is one of the most inspiring and overlooked milestones in women's rights. Their story is one of courage, sexism and patriotism, but above all a story about women who want to break the confines of the world they live in and reach for the skies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aRsik7ggjOjwYEtPfPi3aag0S6P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spitfire Women","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
