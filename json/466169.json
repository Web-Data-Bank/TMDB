Michael divides his time between the job center and the pub. A chance meeting with Lee, an introduction to her Uncle Ian and a heavy night on the lash lead to a job working the door at a Northern Quarter massage parlor. After witnessing the violent death of one of the punters, Michael experiences blood-drenched flashbacks and feels himself being sucked into a twilight world that he doesn't understand but that is irresistibly attractive. When he eventually finds out what goes on in the room below Cloud 9, Michaels' life will never be the same again.","popularity":4.155,"poster_path":"/9whArSgSl7PmoAsA9l65ldSkXTR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51254,"logo_path":"/kgWezXWIdSInE9ZOO4rI2TeK1C4.png","name":"Not a Number","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":95706,"logo_path":"/6H2AkKh3Li9jvzfxSublaPiVPIY.png","name":"Tin Hat Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One taste... and you're hooked","title":"Habit","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":27}
