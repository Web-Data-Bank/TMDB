Commissioned by the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, the moving documentary was shot over two years, bearing witness to the difficult journeys and decisions of life and death confronted by ordinary people. The Lees face multiple tragedies in a short period of time as the patriarch, himself tormented with illness, deals with the grief of losing his daughter and wife. His son hopes that he will soon find peace in heaven. The Chans live in an elderly home and rely on their unmarried middle-aged daughter who has long carried the financial and emotional pressure of caring for them. Lam Siu Ming duly carries out filial responsibilities for the only family he has left, the cancer-stricken mentally disabled mother who abandoned him as a child.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zjjYH9j9XCcmSE9pNfV9d2vrkG9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2016-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snuggle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
