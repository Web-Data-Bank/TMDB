Answering separate reports of a shooting and of a kidnapping at the motel, police found Cooke's body, clad only in a sports jacket and shoes but no shirt, pants or underwear. He had sustained a gunshot wound to the chest, which was later determined to have pierced his heart. The motel's manager, Bertha Franklin, said she had shot Cooke in self-defense after he broke into her office residence and attacked her. Her account was immediately questioned and disputed by acquaintances.","popularity":0.813,"poster_path":"/qAfxwsPpaaqPSj9yAB8ot8oRdnm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Signed Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lady, You Shot Me: The Life and Death of Sam Cooke","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
