Youngster Jakub, out of delusory solidarity, gets convicted of theft and goes to prison in place ofthe \"sheriff\" of his gang. He naively hopes that the sheriff will appreciate his gesture and leaves the stolen goods in a safe hideaway to later divide them fairly among the gang members. This conviction gives Jakub the strength to endure the unbearable conditions in the center. But reality is often much harsher than naive ideals and hollow relations in the gang.","popularity":1.133,"poster_path":"/aOoE6vexethra8CbXJbWKbcE8cW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Štúdio hraných filmov Bratislava","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1966-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sheriff Behind Bars","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":6}
