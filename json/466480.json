Home gives us a sense of belonging and stability. It’s so much more than just a physical structure. It’s our safety, our refuge, our launch pad. Yet, so many people in the U.S. face housing instability and homelessness. A shocking 76% of Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck. They are just one accident or injury away from losing everything. Losing a place to call their own. Our Journey Home explores how home shapes us and challenges our perceptions about people in need of public housing. The film examines the role we all play in supporting those who struggle in having a stable place from where they can grow and dream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hca52tdacJWjenvtG9e3pd8uBCp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"You can't dream when you're struggling to survive.","title":"Our Journey Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
