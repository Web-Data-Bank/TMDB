Citizens all over the world, from a General Motors director to average employees of Polaroid, from account-holders in Barclays Bank to consumers who boycott Shell gas, all refuse to let business with South Africa go on as usual. Faced with attacks at home and growing chaos in South Africa, international companies pull out in a massive exodus that undermines the apartheid system. It is the first international grassroots campaign to use economic pressure to bring down a government.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2Uklkcda8INprCcCBdGUgrya6gN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Have You Heard from Johannesburg: The Bottom Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
