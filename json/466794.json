With the 16mm Bolex camera mounted on a tripod, I wound the motor a single crank and ran as far as I could before the camera stopped (about 1 second). I returned and wound it 2 cranks and did the same, then repeated the process adding one crank each time. With these self-imposed limitations, would I make it to the top of the hill before the film ran out?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bjnXFYOBMiujsZwA9PdpW97nkUG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Degrees of Limitation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
