It is the result of a 4 months long job. Due to the very high selection standards, less than 2% of the shots taken were used to create this immersive video.  First, paints are mixed, then they are “opened”, a specific process that we have worked out while on a trip in Japan.  \"GALAXY GATES\" is an experimental dreamlike video rocking us smoothly through circular moves.  The visual compositions have been created out of paint, oil and soap liquid.
