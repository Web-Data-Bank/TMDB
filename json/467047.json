Set to atmospheric sounds and a pulsating hum, the 43-minute piece looks back from an imagined future upon the post-Anthropocene: the aftermath of significant human influence on Earth. An army of scientists appear to investigate the archaeological remnants of civilization after humanity has made itself extinct. Shot entirely using a drone, Rosefeldt’s images hover meditatively over the desolate landscape and ruins. Connoting surveillance, the drone’s bird’s eye view removes human perspective with us onlookers kept at a distance throughout. Increasingly, more figures dressed in white lab suits emerge to inspect the ruins of civilization – which are in fact abandoned film sets close to the Moroccan Atlas Mountains.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Land of Drought","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
