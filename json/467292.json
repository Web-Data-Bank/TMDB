With everything gone overnight, Seung-woo spends every day meaninglessly in a small attic room but is comforted by Ga-hee who is like a mother, a sister and a lover.  He starts developing feelings for her while writing poems and reading books with sounds of piano played by Ga-hee in the background.  It's been a year since Seung-woo stayed in that house, then one cold winter night, he leaves behind a note thanking the lady for everything. Thirteen years later, Seung-woo, Dong-hee and Ga-hee reunite but he's become a corrupted 32-year old addicted to smoking, drinking and women. The two girls can't help but be shocked at the way he turned out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qreyRzr5ubeg5DRarJtiFtHg8ML.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Mio Dea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
