In 1999, Bachar collaborated with The Atlas Group to produce 53 videotapes about his captivity. Tapes #17 and #31 are the only two tapes Bachar makes available outside of Lebanon. In the tapes, Bachar addresses the cultural, textual, and sexual aspects of his detention with the Americans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eNPWEAMgnlttF82PP0m2Cyr5KFN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hostage: The Bachar Tapes (English Version)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
