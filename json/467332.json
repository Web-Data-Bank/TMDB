When Claudine investigates the case of a soldier convicted of rape, she discovers that his trial was unfair and that he was convicted on the basis of little evidence. In her journey to obtain justice, she uncovers a system where the basic principles of law are ignored. And when the system fails, everyone becomes a victim. The documentary not only provides a glimpse into the failings of the Congolese judicial system but also raises questions about the role of the international community and non-governmental organizations in reforming it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Justice for Sale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
