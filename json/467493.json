She confronts problems like a vacuum cleaner sucks up dirt from the carpet. She shares everything she has with her two moody children (Noah Taylor, Sarah Hooper) and her equally erratic neighbours.  She also shares everything her rich and constantly out-of-town employers have. While Ann vacuums her clientsâ€™ penthouses, her friends enjoy the million dollar views, luxury appointments, home gyms, cocktails by the pool - the things they have always wanted, but could never in their wildest dreams afford.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7P1D1X6BletZ9re39TJd9oKo2CR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zenith Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Australia","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1991-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Crop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
