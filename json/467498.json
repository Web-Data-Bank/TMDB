Paint chips and discarded plywood litter the broken sidewalk that leads from the empty back parking lot through knee-high weeds to the house where local performance art collective Dead White Zombies' newest site-specific performance installation takes place. Video projections play on various monitors. Loud Rap music surrounds us. Mama is cooking and cleaning in the kitchen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":92757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dead White Zombies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"(typical nxxxx behavior)","title":"TNB","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
