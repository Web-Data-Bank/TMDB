It is the kind of quietude which many of us connect immediately with the south. Everything seems to be in its perfect place, and time is just passing. In the setting of a sanatorium a nobleman is practicing idleness and slow-motion mind games. Does it sound boring? Yes, it does. But it is not, the uneventfulness is definitively enthralling. The film director tries to narrate time, time itself, as such, for its own sake: a rare experiment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":98343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Do.Re.Mi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1917-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le mogli e le arance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
