During extra time of the final match of the 2006 World Cup, pitting France against Italy, the French leader, superstar Zidane, for some unknown reason took a running start and head-butted Materazzi in the chest. Zidane was sent off the field and, as a result, the French lost the match on penalties. This head-butt and the unexpected loss were now bound together in the minds of sports fans forever. But the burning question - why did it happen? – has never been properly answered.
