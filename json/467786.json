When I do in June 2011, my whole life turns upside down. I am just a regular passenger at first. Like other people I was sorry, and felt obliged to help and care for other passengers. Then I begin to film these common heroes with my camera. Those who speak about hope, who provide it and get on the bus, Ms. Kim Jin-suk, and other crane laborers who risk their safety while demonstrating for their rights on high. She, while stationed insecurely on high, begins interacting with the world through Twitter and makes friends. Then I realize I really love her. Will we have her back safely?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8AbIzfP5bbW2ln6rWgbN6eEaPTG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitte des Lebens","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2012-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"'We are meant to be...'","title":"Jinsuk & Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
