Now they face the next step in their life: marriage. They are no different from ordinary couples in Korea when marriage is concerned. Woo-young is forty years old. Ever since his father died, he could no longer delay his marriage with Jae-nyun and openly proposes to her several times. On the other hand, Jae-nyun, who was happy with Woo-young's first marriage proposal, experiences difficulty in giving a definite answer to Woo-young. She is worried about married life. To make matters worse, her future mother-in-law makes an interview of how she accepts Jae-nyun as her daughter-in-law, which suffocates Jae-nyun even more with the patriarchal custom the marriage system hides beneath the surface.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6ogYX07C9dtFXYtWLWZt2W2AYFJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53366,"logo_path":"/5fbWZ4BsG9gh50cay7lOj5aKguu.png","name":"Cinema Dal","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":125981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ozi Film","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sea of Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
