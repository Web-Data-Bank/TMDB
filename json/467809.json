It is not necessary for visitors to stay for the entire duration - they can come and go as they please. Created by Anthony McCall, it is based on the architectural framing of time and light. It came at the end of a series of works in which McCall was stripping back cinema to its absolute minimum - light, time, and human experience/perception.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/aLcxTWm2DOTFuqG7kT3lSJEJlrh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":1440,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Film for Ambient Light","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
