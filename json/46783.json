We watch her use heroine, fall in love with other women, be pursued by men, engage in murderous violence, hide out in a crack house, and decide to leave the city.  We see her mother, also a streetwalker and drug user, occasionally talk about her lost daughter.  Fiona has a necklace she was clutching when a foundling. Will mother and daughter meet? Is there a silver lining?","popularity":1.414,"poster_path":"/4qbrYrhzr04eXv1w2ZaIwsw9TEc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fiona","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":14}
