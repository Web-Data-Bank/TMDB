The substitution of the original  television commentary with a song sung in German by Laibach (a group from what was then Yugoslavia and is now Slovenia) removes the spectacle from its pompous temporal context and reveals the absolutism of its alluring power. The totalitarian display is in itself art – politically active art, the art of all-out pathos – even if we call it only “quote art unquote”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/psgLhqLSwOggoGbycEbTolVB3g0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art is Power","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
