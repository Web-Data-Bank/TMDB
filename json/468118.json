In an era when many musicians were emulating Charlie Parker’s drug abuse, Brown inspired others to achieve greatness while living a clean life. Ironically, he was killed in a car accident at the age of 25.  This feature-length documentary presents a richly detailed account of Brown’s life, and examines his historical importance in the context of three criteria–innovation, influence, and individuality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zV9ajpGoa3hqgFOQdAUZuxiiFM1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glanden Productions LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Life, Music & Legacy of Clifford Brown","title":"Brownie Speaks","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
