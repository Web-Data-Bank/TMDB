She wanders life like a ghost, articulating her suffering perspectives in repetitive thoughts and journals. Everything changes when she decides to write a romance fantasy for the way she wished things would go, including an alter ego named Rie meeting a man named Fuyuki in love at first sight. Her debut novel \"Soft Cream Love\" is a huge hit, and Eri is catapulted to wealth and circles of admirers. Shy, she blows her chance to meet a cute guy and instead makes a pass at her clumsy unattractive agent named Hoshino, who walks away with his cynical attitudes born of romantic disappointment. When she pursues him into the street, she by chance meets a nice guy just as she hoped, but he never shows up at their first date because, unknown to her, he's hit by a car.","popularity":1.211,"poster_path":"/xK44HjhG4Pnd4XYB29lYLWN50p4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1239,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aichi Arts Center","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body Drop Asphalt","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
