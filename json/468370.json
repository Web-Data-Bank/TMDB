THE LOOM might be compared to musical quartet-form (as there are almost always four superimposed pictures); but the complexity of texture, multiplicity of tone, and the variety of interrelated rhythm, suggest symphonic dimensions. The film is very inspired by George Melies: the animals exist (in Jane's enclosure) as on a stage, their interrelationships edited to the disciplines of dance, so therefore one might say this hardly represents \"animal life on earth\"; but I would argue that this work at least epitomizes theatrical Nature, magical Creature, and is the outside limit, to date, of my art in that respect. (The balance-of-light was so perfectly realized in making the neg. of this print that I wish to credit Western Cine Lab's \"timer\" Louise Fujiki as creative collaborator in the accomplishment of this work.)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u3F1cOQBHgmrgXT3aysQj1yWt3t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canyon Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Loom","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
