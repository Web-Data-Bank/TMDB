In July 2016, Reynolds broadcast, via Facebook Live, the moments after the murder of her partner Philando Castile by a police officer during a traffic stop in Minnesota. Reynolds' video circulated widely online and amassed over six million views. In November 2016, with the assistance of Chisenhale Gallery, artist Luke Willis Thompson established a conversation with Reynolds, and her lawyer, and invited Reynolds to work with him on the production of an artwork. Thompson proposed to make an aesthetic response that could act as a ‘sister-image’ to Reynolds’ video broadcast. Thompson and Reynolds agreed to produce a film together, to be presented in London, and which would break with the well-known image of Reynolds, caught in a moment of violence and distributed within a constant flow of news.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j2zDmyvZcmdmu7ddT77sY8B1so9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"autoportrait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
