The person behind the said page, Mona happens to be missing. Her friend, and a fellow student, Sarah recruits the help of a classmate, Wiki - a borderline sociopathic genius. This odd-couple of amateur sleuths carry on their investigation as the story leads them into unexpected corners and terrifying revelations. It's a pacy thriller, confined to limited locations on one single campus, populated by fresh, sexy, young characters that can be executed on a fairly shoestring budget. More importantly it captures the present zeitgeist of young India and its obsession with social networking.","popularity":1.283,"poster_path":"/f7NhXgX6PbbRs3wExlop8p5VpIM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alt J Films","origin_country":""},{"id":93564,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Ray Films","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mona Darling","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
