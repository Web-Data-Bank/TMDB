Not surprisingly, Rikke is somewhat bored. She enters a contest put on by a cereal company which has as its grand prize a horse. Since she lives in the city in a second floor apartment, it never occurred to her that she might win, but win she does. The horse (\"Mama-Mia\") duly appears, and she and the members of her slum neighborhood come together to cope with the situation in a delightful way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gz0YoNy5plwUAqcIzoUsc1HWmXw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1989-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tarzan Mama Mia","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":5}
