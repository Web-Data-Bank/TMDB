The five girls first try to defend themselves, but when they find out that nobody believes them - neither the school principal nor even their own parents - they decide to accomplish what they have been falsely accused of. And although their clumsy attempts are mostly comic, at one point they almost cause a big tragedy.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/9LVfMezgN3JPoeJODqZB9VUnPcn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Štúdio hraných filmov Bratislava","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1967-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Pact with the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
