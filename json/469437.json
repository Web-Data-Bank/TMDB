His investigation reveals that the victim was responsible for the financial control of a large building organization and that he was being used to cover the illegality of his administration. This organization had abused much of the money earmarked for the erection of homes for homeless war wounded, and is now very much annoyed by the revelations of Augustus. This is why they try to close his mouth, but he is not hurt and continues the investigation.
