Inexplicably, Elisa flees the scene of the accident, stops a passing driver and tells him a made-up story about a stolen car, concealing her husband's death. Feeling sorry for the girl, the driver, Philippe Morçot, gives her a lift and later lets her stay at his house. The good deed, however, doesn't go unpunished, and soon Philippe is drawn into Elisa's twilight world of fantasies, lies and paranoia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Y9xYrdk9UmbN1Woce1YEcPzKvG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sumer Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1965-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The False Step","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
