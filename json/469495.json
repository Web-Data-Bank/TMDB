It takes the form of an amphitheatre of video projections presenting a new musical composition, created in partnership with British composer Orlando Gough, artist and musician Tim Kerr and six grindcore vocalists. It interweaves extreme metal music culture with classical choral traditions; the intense sounds and body movements of the vocalists, together with the backdrop of the out-dated German Democratic Republic radio studio in which the piece was Ô¨Ålmed, all contribute to the atmosphere of this unique and enveloping work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cantata Profana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
