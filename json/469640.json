Few cameras have ever been allowed inside this guarded and controversial placeâ€”until now. Produced with exclusive permission to film within the 35-acre walled enclosure and the Dome of the Rock, this program serves to build greater understanding of the sacred and secret location. Incorporating interviews with religious and historical scholars, the video includes a remarkable archaeological discovery that may finally lay to rest centuries of debate over the very existence of the First Temple.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zgyDxcam6rtGhUhnVguaju8BNlz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic: Inside Jerusalem's Holiest Places","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
