John becomes increasingly disillusioned and severely depressed as he begins to question any possible meaning of human thoughts and emotions that can be replicated on computer software. On the verge of a mental breakdown, he meets Emily-a shy, bohemian novelist that is unable to find emotional sustenance outside of the world of her own writing. This is the story of two lost souls searching for a shadow of love in an increasingly alienating modern world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bkhF10IwQLRrpQXfMGsFAaGdGeF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A computer programmer becomes increasingly disillusioned while working on a project to replicate human intelligence using a map of the human genome.","title":"2021","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
