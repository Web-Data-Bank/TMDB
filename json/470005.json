His debut in the early 2000s inaugurated a new era in the history of the audio-visual. Fifty years of archives trace the evolution of entertainment: how the staging of intimacy during the 80s opened new territories, how the privatization of the biggest channels has changed the relationship with the spectator. With the contribution of specialists, including philosopher Bernard Stiegler, this documentary demonstrates how emotion has made way for the exacerbation of the most destructive impulses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ychr84ZQ5wdDv2amxxTCyRBFuRy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le temps de cerveau disponible","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
