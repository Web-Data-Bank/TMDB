She spends hours online searching for inspiration but all she finds is weird fan fiction. Her dream was looking like that's all it'd ever be. Well yet again , after being told her comics won't be picked up, she replays it in her head like a nightmare over and over then when she snaps out of it, she realizes what she needs to do! She needs to create her some god damn \"Daddy Issues\" just like comic book issues but with daddy! She thinks back to all those weird fan fictions she read about step-dads fucking step-daughters and so on. She realizes that's a sure way to get picked up by a publisher! Now, all she has to do is experience it first hand that way she knows exactly how to write about it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/on6bfAoebfIAIip5Adl9IcDQ1c4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Desperate Pleasures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creating Daddy Issues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
