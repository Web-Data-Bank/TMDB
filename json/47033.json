In 1948, a young man, a boy, and a waiter are captivated during the full moon by a mysterious woman in a  lilac dress. The effects of this event ripple across the years, washing over more than 80 characters, including a disc jockey, a fairy princess, a gangster, Alexander Pushkin, and a nostalgic dog. But which of these are dreams, and which reality? Director Shakhnazarov continues his career-long focus on the intersection of past and present with this mysterious, exhilarating mosaic of humankind, which in the end both seduces and satisfies.","popularity":1.178,"poster_path":"/klvY59USdSmXXgrnfR2VWSQou53.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kuryer","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":170585,"logo_path":"/1nUzkMSbZOzoYgHHhBSJ5xGwnIm.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1998-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day of the Full Moon","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
