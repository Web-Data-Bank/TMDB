Imagine finally connecting singers' bodies to the voices you have always treasured on record, watching footage of performances from another era. All of singers featured here have something in common (with one exception, Sutherland): they sang and performed on stage before the advent of filmed opera. . And it shows, for the first time, a few tantalizing minutes of recently recovered footage from Callas' legendary Lisbon Traviata, featuring Addio dal Passato and Parigi oh cara with Alfredo Kraus. This DVD will leave you asking for more.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/na4p5SabFVtJm59xNOUEvVGXYM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39477,"logo_path":"/hfXGuDnuVFOYJVfw83fJvGUtt5O.png","name":"KQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Singing: Golden Voices of the Century","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
