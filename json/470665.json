In the post-war period, 150,000 people were hidden away in 120 of these vast Victorian institutions all across the country. Today, most mental patients, or service users as they are now called, live out in the community and the asylums have all but disappeared. Through powerful testimonies from patients, nurses and doctors, the film explores this seismic revolution and what it tells us about society's changing attitudes to mental illness over the last sixty years.","popularity":0.694,"poster_path":"/nVxPmI4qhiJZYHbq9NO84fcMf8Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mental: A History of the Madhouse","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
