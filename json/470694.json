While most of them enjoy the meal, one man has a strange reaction: Taking a set of horns off the wall, he attaches them to his head and sets off on a rampage. After destroying the house and terrifying his hostess, her guests, maid, and neighbours, he takes to the streets. The police sends a telegraph to Spain asking for help, and in response a parade of matadors arrive in Paris, ready to slay the crazy beast-man. However, soon after the man-bull fight begins, the errant guest comes to his senses and is taken into custody by waiting policemen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A1JCMhbyA2JCoD9ec775psRVrvi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1909-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le monsieur qui a mangé du taureau","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
