Having been trained by their country to be nothing but killers, the soldiers claim to have become morally numb and unable to see non-Japanese as even human. Perhaps feeling some remorse for what they have done, they now choose to tell their stories for the world to hear.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/y9DtLMpIz8uPtbTfNSST95SG8ey.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69495,"logo_path":null,"name":"Directors System Co.","origin_country":""},{"id":128477,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Riben Guizi Production Committee","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Japanese Devils","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5}
