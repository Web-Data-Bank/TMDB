We explore the complex, albeit brief, relationship between Rose, an aspiring photographer, who meets Khrisna - a dancer. The film gives an unique, negative and perhaps melancholy perspective on love and attraction and how people at the end of the day just might not be attracted to one another, and must simply learn how to move on to the next thing, whatever that might entail. The story isn't trying to say anything big or new in regards to romance other than subverting 'the teenage ideal' of being in a relationship which sees no lasting potential just for the sake of fitting in.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eRpKfssfYHnB1ICIVQgib3eyshJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An aspiring photographer has a chance encounter with a street performer who finds it challenging when his girlfriend's aspirations overwhelm his own insecurities.","title":"One Night More","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
