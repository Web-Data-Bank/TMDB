Its tone is set by the juxtaposition of slow moving  homo-erotic images and opaque landscapes through which two men take a journey into their own desires. Offscreen, Dame Judi Dench recites a sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets that counterpoint the action. Jarman called it, “My most austere work, but also the closest to my heart.”","popularity":1.933,"poster_path":"/nunIaKsMLQDJSjxzFvhoZz041q3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Angelic Conversation","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":19}
