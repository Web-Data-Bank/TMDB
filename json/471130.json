One day he is put in charge of interviewing Father Louis Stephen, a famed catholic missionary who helps the needy in the jungles of Brazil. Yet he has one problem: the Father has rarely ever given an interview. However, Michael decides that he will be the first to have interviewed the Father personally, and goes on a journey to the center of Brazil, in search of the priest. Michael will soon know how hard it can be to get an interview, and that the Father's apparent media-shyness has deeper implications than he thought.","popularity":0.908,"poster_path":"/pkVpIcoPb8nrcadhjCa4h1Ywmcy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boku Films","origin_country":""},{"id":94389,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ravina Produções","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jenipapo","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":2}
