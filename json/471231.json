The poem was picked through chance operation, by throwing Wanda’s poems into the air. The superimpostions were done in-camera, thus the synchronizations of word and image were also determined through chance operation. By superimposing in the camera over a sync sound shot the images in this film are presented as they were filmed, without editing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AoZ1QbXBv2wzIuhNjv31YhSVjNh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Nothings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
