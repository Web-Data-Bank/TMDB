Much of this fluid was produced by one Atlanta-based company, and Coca-Cola: The History of an American Icon offers a panegyric to the Real Thing. The history of Coke is the history of its advertising, and this documentary draws on a rich archive of print, film, and television material to show how John Pemberton's soda recipe became such a potent symbol of American society. Coca-Cola: The History of an American Icon is, unsurprisingly, a one-sided history. There is no suggestion that the Coca-Colonization of the planet might have a downside, and lines like \"If the world's having a bad time, it's OK because there's still Coke\" are delivered without a hint of irony. Nevertheless, this documentary offers some fascinating insights into the history of Coca-Cola.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3IxmQ32PGw3nwNnyHJyqvZ04UAn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coca-Cola: The History of an American Icon","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
