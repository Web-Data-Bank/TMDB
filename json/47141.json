He suspects people live up in the tree when he keeps finding various items and trash under the tree. The government appointed street cleaner doesn't do much, except occasionally take trashy people off the street and into the garbage. He suspects the maid of stealing food and sexual perversions, and the police precinct is literally a farm with insane cops imprisoning lamps and horses.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/16UHlcAvMdunxOuivsAEpfm8mlG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42155,"logo_path":null,"name":"DR TV-Teatret","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hash Tree","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
