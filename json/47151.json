Their son is an involuntary witness to all this, cooped up despondently in his room banging his head against the wall. To get away from the situation, he escapes into a virtual world. But when the man finds himself inopportunely stuck out on the balcony of the apartment, a burglar gets into the building. At the same time, in a neighbouring apartment, spies are getting ready to listen in on a group of scientists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ki68Xn4QY5tHSIrpsXLaTbHJxAZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12432,"logo_path":"/zOgIPe7TadxPBpuUsoWWSryYO6y.png","name":"Eesti Joonisfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Without Gabriella Ferri","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3}
