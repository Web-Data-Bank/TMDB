The film takes its cue from Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks’ visit to Russia in 1926. The story follows a film-obsessed young girl (played by Aleksandra Kudriavtseva) who arrives home, still dizzy with excitement. Because today was the day that she saw … Mary and Doug! And not only that, but: “Mary SAW ME!” The inserted newsreel footage is cut so as to give the illusion of a special moment of eye contact between her and Mary & Doug. Her joy is palpable. “She’ll take me to – AMERICA!” And when the girl lies down to take a rest, she is transformed into a cartoon character – and the film enters an animated Hollywood dreamland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qOv9gWD8aPzVGAFGZ1GyYczoaSa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One of Many","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
