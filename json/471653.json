Commissioned by the public arts nonprofit Creative Time, the visually mesmerizing project received acclaim from the art world and the thousands of New Yorkers who witnessed the performances during the spring of 2016. The Village Voice awarded Riley a lifetime achievement award for \"elevating the prestige of pigeons in the public consciousness.\" This piece follows Riley's process from conception to final performance, and ultimately like the project itself, examines urban humanity's relationship to the natural world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vgiOB8u8YxH8nVUMQvI11643n9D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of thousands of pigeons and the man who made them stars.","title":"Fly by Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
