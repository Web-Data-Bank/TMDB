The film takes the form of a travelogue across Croatia, Italy, Slovenia and Turkey, and examines men, young and old, who come together like their ancestors did – to play games. During filming, however, the director suddenly faces a serious creative crisis and turns the camera on himself, turning the film into a playful homage to absurdity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v7NczVl5zd3NEbF533vP05aH4oq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83800,"logo_path":"/qAIl2gCsGw3jnMbE6lGaHex7jie.png","name":"Restart","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":93927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nosorogi","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2017-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playing Men","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10}
