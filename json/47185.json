Her thoughts drift back to that summer ... to bathing in the hot springs ... to when they first met ... and embraced. Down Under - Australia, the desert, a blistering heat wave. His pickup stops at an icehouse ... he lays the blocks neatly on the buckboard ... and drives off haunted by a aching memory. Without dialogue or comment, save for verses from a sonnet by John Keats, Fridrik Thor Fridriksson links the thoughts, the emotions, the sensual longing of young lovers at opposite ends of the world. A tone poem, a collage of sight and sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t57XG3QIUYeNNuXsP4Nj9Ex7PhT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2002-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Top Down Under","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5}
