From ostriches to kiwis, these bizarre birds appear to be nature's greatest novelty act. How they came to be and how they continue to survive is a fascinating tale that has long captivated Sir David Attenborough. It is a story of dedicated dads, enormous eggs and a serious need for speed. And far from being the court jesters of the animal world, these flightless curiosities once nearly ruled the land.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/5PRQhJShou4stPq03k1tD9sRYOA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Attenborough's Big Birds","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
