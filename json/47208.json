It tells the story of the struggle of African Americans to register to vote in the fictional town of Quinlan. In the midst of the Freedom Summer, a group of high school students in the small town are eager to make grassroots changes in their own community. The young activists meet resistance not only from white southerners, but from their parents, who have experienced firsthand the violence that can result from speaking out.[1] As high school students band together with the support of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, they make strides in registering African-American voters and gaining awareness for their cause.","popularity":1.143,"poster_path":"/nFoPavCiN4fKGY23BZUahyu1GYb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Turner Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A father, a son and a movement that would change America forever.","title":"Freedom Song","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
