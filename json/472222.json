And since George - even though he was waiting for him in every corner of the earth - has not been able to go because of financial straits, foreigners come to \"Cafe\", where he is the owner of his cafeteria.  How not to have a \"eye\" in Yanis with a \"ni\", Merkel, Schiele, Daiselblum, and Lagarde?  Is Zoe not taking the skull and banning the toilet to the neighborhood police officer?  How not to look for ways to make their shopping in the supermarket more pleasant, the three elderly \"musees\" Kleio, Efterpi and Polymnia?  How can they not express the wrong texts through their songs, the four tracked troubadours?  How can the economic crisis even the Snow White fail?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tbec2Nd3CI7D3KmR0DgFh1iOqwQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peninta apohroseis to Greece","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
