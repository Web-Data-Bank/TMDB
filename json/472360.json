Her interviews go beyond the “little deaths” of the title, seamlessly moving between issues of sexual violence, political protest, love, family, and mortality. In a culture where sexual taboos run deep, what the women of Little Deaths have in common is a belief in liberation and self-discovery through sexuality, and a remarkable courage in the face of tragedy and oppression.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/40kPzrqa8MKoflMV3YCGWgmJylU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2013-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":286,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las muertes chiquitas","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
