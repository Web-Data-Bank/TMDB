With new dress codes, psychological testing, and early-morning wake-up calls with track laps as punishment, the boys and girls decide Wizzle and Peabody have to go. But how? As they pull out all the stops, they ultimately turn to the theory that “love conquers all” to oust the pair once and for all.","popularity":2.915,"poster_path":"/lU54HYbjbWq4QsdyIRnfvfBhEkY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aircraft Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruno & Boots: The Wizzle War","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":25}
