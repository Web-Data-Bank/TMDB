The film enacts a series of duets, both within and between images, featuring choreography by boychild with Josh Johnson and by Ligia Lewis with Jonathan Gonzalez, both to original music by Bendik Giske. The work is rooted in Tsangâ€™s ongoing dialogue with collaborators Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, authors of The Undercommons, and in particular on their recent essay Leave Our Mics Alone, which posits an (im)possible set of images of resistance, through poetic notions of blackness (and/or transness and/or queerness) as an improvisational mode of being, in common with others, working through and of the environment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iiNcSnd0JNenXvC0KYcFkUyA422.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Hold Where Study","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
