After the Wall came down in 1989, what happened to the major Leipzig School painters Werner Tübke and Bernhard Heisig, who had been called “Dürer’s red heirs” by West German journalists in the 1970s? In the film, Tübke, Heisig, and former GDR officials who were involved with the cultural scene in Leipzig at the time talk about modernism, conformism, political pressure, party discipline, personal claims, and fading memory. The documentary paints an insightful, often critical picture of early East German art history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7JRTotr6LeAlbzysAtApABEwwOK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lutz Dammbeck Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1996-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duerers Heritage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
