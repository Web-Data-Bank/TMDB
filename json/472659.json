Attempts to renew military training or compulsory military service and in general to prepare the nation for the next big war go hand in hand with society’s fear of the Russians, the Muslims, or whatever other “enemies”. This observational flight over the machine gun nest of Czech militarism becomes a grotesque, unsettling military parade. It can be considered not only to be a message about how easily people allow themselves to be manipulated into a state of paranoia by the media, but also a warning against the possibility that extremism will become a part of the regular school curriculum.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n7GSGtGeQoE9vUx6KHgcHmgnrRR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8655,"logo_path":"/iy3xGixP7KGlZ6eNgsDv28DXBOl.png","name":"Hypermarket Film","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2016-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teaching War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
