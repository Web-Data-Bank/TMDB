Some of these galaxies are so incredibly far away that it has supposedly taken many billions of years for their light to reach Earth. Yet, the Bible indicates a universe that is only thousands of years old. How does light from the most distant galaxies reach Earth within the biblical timescale? In this DVD, astrophysicist Dr. Jason Lisle (Ph.D, University of Colorado) shows that distant starlight in a young universe is not a problem for God. There are several different methods that God may have used. 47 minutes on DVD.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bA5BZEOkkh6DOY9GNvBFTGGCBbw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not a Problem for a Young Universe","title":"Distant Starlight","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
