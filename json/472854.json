In this program, Barney, Guggenheim curator Nancy Spector, and others deconstruct the Cycle’s filming and subsequent translation into sculptural installations. The locations, characters, and symbols that organize the Cycle films; the Cycle installations as spatial content carriers and extensions of the performances; and objectification of the body and undifferentiated sexuality are addressed, as are the intricacies of costuming, makeup, and sculpting with Barney’s signature materials: plastic, metal, and Vaseline.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fA6tvlNtOJ4c8ds6ouGEgLs5pdl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Body as Matrix: Matthew Barney's Cremaster Cycle","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
