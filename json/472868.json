Things change suddenly when, as he is watching television, a news report about the ongoing war in Mindanao shows footage of a badly wounded soldier waiting to be rescued. That soldier, almost bleeding to death, is his father, Corporal Lino Bolante. This starts his journey as he and his mother Sonia wait for help that comes too late. This story does not only show how the war in Mindanao robs a child of his innocence, but also shows the shadows of war that Filipino homes confront everyday.","popularity":1.093,"poster_path":"/2sbcNRsVl5Ws1ffnhivmnL66wrM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58344,"logo_path":"/fqKgcQfGyWojZ2QOPAAGUO7akrR.png","name":"Voyage Studios","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":15808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemalaya Foundation","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":31156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beyond the Box","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2010-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Halo-Halo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
