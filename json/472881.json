He and his companions are in the final stage of their current site in the mountains of Suyo, Ilocos Sur, an area reputed as a Japanese stronghold during World War II. All the signs at their site indicate that they are certain to find treasure. With their resources nearly depleted, Manok convinces his godfather in marriage, Freddie, to finance the rest of their operations. Manok, Freddie, and another friend, Boyet, journey back to the site hoping that, as their medium predicted, they will find gold before Manok’s wife gives birth in a month’s time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dR1hM8bkso7MnAifYo7w9Rc5Dmt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemalaya Foundation","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2009-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"24K","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
