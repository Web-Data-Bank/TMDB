Billy Cobham is one of those few artists.  For over 30 years, he has received international acclaim as the total consummate drummer. Billy Cobham's explosive technique powered some of the fusion genre's most important early recordings -- including groundbreaking efforts by Miles Davis and Mahavishnu Orchestra -- before he became an accomplished band leader in his own right.  At his best, Cobham harnessed his amazing dexterity into thundering high octane hybrids of jazz complexity and rock and roll aggression. He was capabale of subtler, funkier grooves on the one hand, and awe-inspiring solo improvisations on the other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fM2g7JF9cc0RlQ6LKyW5Cl66RkA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jazz Legends: Billy Cobham Live At The Palais Des Festivals Hall Cannes 1989","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
