That all of these wishes have become a reality is probably down to the immense stubbornness of this charismatic and equally hilarious matriarch who has a weakness for collecting crazy objects. When financial circumstances force the family to sell their castle, her adult children are left sifting through a lifetime of peculiarities in search of a few lost bones… Spanish actor and neo director Gustavo Salmerón paints a deliciously absurd family portrait that just happens to reveal a lot about Spain, Catholicism and the economic crisis.","popularity":3.003,"poster_path":"/1IXufNFOPhRvOnng1f3ElkwxGCp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sueños Despiertos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lots of Kids, a Monkey and a Castle","video":false,"vote_average":7.14,"vote_count":43}
