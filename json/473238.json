Call Me is about a man who thinks a night of passion is in store, but when he gets home, what awaits him is far from passion. In Patterson Road, a group of teens ventures to a wooded area rumored to have a hidden cemetery. They should have been careful what they asked for because in this case, that's exactly what they got. Speaking Ill of the Dead has a basic theme that karma is a bitch. And Trip has Terra, a struggling alcoholic looking for anything to decrease her stress. In all of these tales, characters had a bad feeling, a gut instinct, about what they were doing, but they didn't listen and paid the ultimate price.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/obu28SfQHDGIxFWSle5vP6VCdJh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Oak Film Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gut Instincts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
