In a shockingly large number of schools, access to technology, connectivity, and teacher-training is nonexistent. Many of those underserved schools are located just a few miles from fully equipped schools with technologically adept teachers in better funded districts. This new film from Rory Kennedy, in which we see the situation through the eyes of students, educators, policy experts, and advocates across the country, clearly lays out the steps we must take a to bring our public education system into the 21st century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xosigbQcSys8TfCYvMjbyAqN6Qu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without a Net: The Digital Divide in America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
