But are they really the reflection of something sublime, everlasting or dare we say, spiritual? Do relationships start in the bedroom or in the heart? In this male love story, the bliss described by Joseph Campbell and sages throughout the millennia is a practical option for finding happiness. As the camera delves into the characterâ€™s minds and actions we find fulfillment on both a physical and spiritual level.","popularity":2.671,"poster_path":"/60C9RmxDypE0hsyK4CIYsfbrjDB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stagewright Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This love dares speak its name","title":"Just Say Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":18}
