Taking the figure of Thelma, a woman working with the plutonium monitors at the core of a reactor, Lahire questions both the process at the core of the plutonium terminal and that one that constructs female identity. Plutonium Blonde is part of a trilogy of films on radiation (the other two are Uranium Hex and Serpent River) that Lahire made in the 1980s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2rRNyRee4TZTn8yAr4PkO97fqCj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of Great Britain","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plutonium Blonde","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
