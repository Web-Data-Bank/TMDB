He took what others might deem trash or obsolete and turned it into something contemplative. He opened Paradise Garden for the world to enjoy, a true testament that Art comes to life, when people are able to interact with it. Howard Finster showed the world that objects surrounding us can take on a new life, in a sometimes magical way, and communicate messages that can lead to transformation.","popularity":0.807,"poster_path":"/wtfJYcbEWft7D7eOR3hHoxagdOU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise Garden: Howard Finster's Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
