Jaime ou a Noite Portuguesa","overview":"This is one of Noronha da Costa's films in which the \"fictional\" component is most visible. D. Jaime or the Portuguese Night, like the rest of Noronha da Costa's films, is part of the gothic films (Terence Fisher's work was one of his great influences), and in it he shows the different variations around the \"specular bodies\", which evolve into luminous magic and into sensual and sensory incandescence. At the same time, we witness a series of ironic and erotic, or historical, views of wicked virgins and laughable sadists, all resurrected from German and British romanticism, while the scenery is no longer Portuguese.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3CJl7S9aABZLsccwP4Cox4ctm5G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"D.
