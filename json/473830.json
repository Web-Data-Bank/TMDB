The traditional tone of the cinematic impressions takes us back into the past (evocations of Boyleâ€™s era, projection using damaged film stock) and the images have something of a cathartic quality about them. The title of this dream-like, mood- -inducing film, a tribute of sorts to the Irish thinker, was inspired by a Jorie Graham poem and underlines the nature of the 14-year process during which the film came together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q2uzC4E9W1QxRoBdrMv7dg7oc8j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"By Pain and Rhyme and Arabesques of Foraging","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
