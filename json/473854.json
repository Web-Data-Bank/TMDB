Although \"Marginalia\" has no story, it reflects my concern with the feel of society at a time of ecological stress and cultural change. As usual, I have super-impositions which were shot in-camera as well as abrasions on the film surface which reflect the cursive waves of marginal notation and, also, situates hand-writing as a vanishing form of communication.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3G3sfrSoWiGuC8FkIkhOdnINI9n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marginalia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
