This DVD celebrates his fiftieth anniversary as a professional musician. Recorded at Germany's Hot Jazz Festival 2002, he presents his new, eleven piece Big Chris Barber Band. And what a pleasure it is - the trombonist and his virtuoso bandmates confidently switch between New Orleans jazz and a tribute to the great Duke Ellington, playing swinging blues, and managing to inject new life into old favorites like Sweet Georgia Brown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Swd4Yxu2YhdsCrvDaH3xh2cJ3d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Chris Barber Band: Hot Jazz Festival Europa Park","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
