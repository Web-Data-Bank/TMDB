Bruce Elder's obsessions with history, media culture, psychology, technology, and the cruelty found in nature. The film acts as a primal scream, literally and metaphorically. The point of departure for the film came shortly after the gruesome suicide of Elder's close friend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qxWMXkXfHlJxso4rD1RoiM0VpQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crack, Brutal, Grief","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
