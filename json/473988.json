The film is visual, perceptual; it was made in awe of the world that goes on with and without us and of our personal, human struggles. It is a film about life and death; a film of discrete units of the eternal and a film of living here and now. It was built up frame by frame-a film about power, played in insignificant terms, in the daily, barely noticed gestures, scenes, frames.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4HjhaUgbBiq8ANxw05Syg0X3XQI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through and Through","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
