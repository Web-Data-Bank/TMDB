A flush of watery blues (in this hand-painted step-printed film) brightens the plant-skein into a veriety (sic) of greens mixed into all other colors-all darkening into smeared mud-blacks with microscopic beseeming black \"splatters\" (where mud-like cracks used to be.) The turquoise blues, red and tans resolve into a flare of red at end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1JtaxwLmK1J0LAZBRt2EZnX1raR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Micro Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
