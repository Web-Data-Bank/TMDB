The auteur's personal narrative is interwoven with those of other Syrian characters who were forced, because of their political beliefs, to leave the country before or after the revolution. The film sheds light on years of silence, fear and terror, and it dives into the stories, which were behind the eruption of Syria’s society and the start of its revolution. It is a Syrian account, which, by laying out the past, tells the story of the future.","popularity":0.808,"poster_path":"/zaaTabmYqvb2bsZNBRjF7Q3DyH4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2016-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Memory in Khaki","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
