In vivid imagery, brilliant close-ups, and delicate conversations, director Jessica Yu presents the intricate, often visionary, work of these nontraditional artists, allowing the patients to describe their approaches and processes in their own, sometimes tangled, words. With patience and calm resilience, Dr. Martin offers feedback and ideas for best methods to the individual artists, who sometimes scream or are in tears, as he helps them displace their frustrations, and demons, onto canvas. Seen as a collective, these works illustrate the fine line between creativity and distress and illuminate the healing power of expression.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4nukIzSwFANibCdmXH6dudPS1PK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Living Museum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
