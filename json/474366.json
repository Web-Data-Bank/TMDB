But there is more to the story: it was Lee Radziwill and Peter Beard who first brought the Maysles to the Beales, when the two set out to make a film about Radziwill's childhood. The reels of that first contact were shelved for 45 years. This documentary recovers the lost footage. Anchored in Beard's recollections and artistic vision, we are returned to \"that summer\" in 1972, a seductive dream world and collage of radically unconventional creative personalities—Warhol, Bacon, Jagger, Capote—practicing the art of living amidst oppressive forces of class expectation and prejudice.","popularity":2.144,"poster_path":"/oC3INIbllZfEPxDVbygogIGQfZt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Story AB","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":8469,"logo_path":"/gSSXLuayChi5h9KEuzfwd2UjWjm.png","name":"Louverture Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Summer","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":13}
