As these items are passed, sold, or stolen from one character to another, a giddy round dance of excess begins to take shape, one which suggests that if history doesn't repeat itself, it certainly rhymes. Together with co-writer Gérard Brach, whose other co-writing credits include Repulsion and Tess, Otar Iosseliani uses a feather-light touch to expose the futility of class and social order, making a bagatelle of the concerns of rich and poor alike.","popularity":1.412,"poster_path":"/koaptR4ORfW4Xu3RRUTl7hI31l3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32054,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sovinfilm","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":8276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Philippe Dussart","origin_country":""},{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10901,"logo_path":"/8dNHWgUlJNz9HHLtcdsz04jRtyi.png","name":"Ministère de la culture","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1985-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Favourites of the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":12}
