His \"master\" is a cruel man, imposing a ridiculous behaviour catalogue with strict charges. The children, about 5-10 years of age, have to work all day and they´re not allowed to go to toilet while at work, let alone visit their parents. Iqbal soon realizes that this is a massive injustice, especially when a member of the (unindentified) country´s Communist and Anti-child labour party takes photographs of the children.","popularity":1.154,"poster_path":"/5UazUE2KSXUeVL7TEjbyMhiMN5N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1998-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iqbal","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":16}
