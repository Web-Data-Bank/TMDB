The premise has Smokey’s big brother, voiced by James Cagney, telling the story of how his brother got his name. It’s a long winded and rambling tale that has very little Smokey and a great deal of a cranky Jimmy. The story has the animals trying to find out who set a forest fire and is poisoning the water. Its not giving anything away to say it’s an escaped circus gorilla that smokes cigars.","popularity":0.909,"poster_path":"/hVZsTC9CSzu7GwHCk0YtZvvjriO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":688,"logo_path":"/65PkdDSyh6fwXgwg47x73pvgWiW.png","name":"Rankin/Bass Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8813,"logo_path":"/dPgnWLcXYwGW6Tv3xAqrI9BS2J.png","name":"Videocraft International","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballad of Smokey the Bear","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
