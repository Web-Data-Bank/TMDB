No Peace/Black, Male ImMediate","overview":"This essay about the policing of young black men, foreshadows the 1992 outcome of the trial which acquitted policeman directly involved in the brutal beating of a black motorist, Rodney King, was made as my graduate school thesis in the film school at San Francisco State University. It also underscores a series of escalating gripping actions and murders of black men and women in America-by police or individuals policing black lives...that would provoke the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was nearly orphaned until I received a request from a scholar looking to write about video tape imagery & justice-just recently. This is the best result of the rescue of footage locked on an obsolete medium- hi-8.
