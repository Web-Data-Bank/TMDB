Shea Stadium was closed (in part to create more parking space for a new stadium, Citi Field), and on July 16 and 18, 2008, Billy Joel headlined the final concerts held at the stadium. Filmmaker Paul Crowder and a camera crew were on hand for Joel's shows, and the documentary THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA chronicles his historic two-night stand, as well as exploring Joel's career, his ties to working-class New York, and how his life and career paralleled the growth of suburban Long Island and the beloved ballpark.","popularity":1.188,"poster_path":"/xnnmPEZJrZCQdjJlrU6UJW75LUe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy Joel - The Last Play at Shea","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
