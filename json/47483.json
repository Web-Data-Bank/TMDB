Cam and Kiff are students in an intense platonic relationship. At a summer party, Cam becomes intoxicated and angry. He's unwilling to admit his attraction to Kiff, and unable to release powerful feelings of grief he's holding inside. Kiff hopes having a good time might make Cam forget his pain. Both are in denial, and the truth's suppression may kill one of them before the night is over. The film is a study in self-deception, a theme worth exploring now, when Americans seem particularly desperate to avoid dealing with reality, and grasp at any diversion rather than look in the mirror.","popularity":0.932,"poster_path":"/olpHBj2k1OonZzsLO9pv9z7DpND.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65239,"logo_path":null,"name":"Speed Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Words are empty when your heart is full.","title":"Yeah No Definitely","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
