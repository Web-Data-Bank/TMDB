These movies are from the show on September 5th. The band had released \"Sorry Ma...\" earlier in the year and were already working on future projects. These clips are presented as they were recorded live... in set order and very much with the tuning that troubled the night. The Replacements were the middle band of three (Husker Du closed the show) and played two 25 minute sets.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vHlWA4ymOyCInv8ZBQhJOCBg3pV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Twin/Tone Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Replacements: Incident on 7th Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
