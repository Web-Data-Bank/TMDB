All this is a roundabout way of saying that Rockpile wasn't hurting for material: they drew heavily upon Edmunds' solo records in particular -- 13 of the songs on this 17-song setlist appeared on one of Dave's LPs -- interspersing a few rock & roll oldies along with songs from Nick, plus a showcase for Billy Bremner","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kmVBH88ETRvOL3V427R9Vq3PXGg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rockpile: Live at Rockpalast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
