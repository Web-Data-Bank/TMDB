Referencing everyone from Marlowe to Shaft, SAPPHIRE AND THE SLAVE GIRL situates its analysis in the persona of the hard-boiled detective in order to highlight transgressions of identity and location. Featuring a multifarious cast of identity-shifting Sapphires, this fast paced genre-bash visualizes and problematizes how identity is negotiated and performed within urban spaces.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4AB4ikPFai9DxeXgIuV3aXLdf3q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sapphire and the Slave Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
