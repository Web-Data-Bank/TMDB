Called 'suitcase children,' they are thrown into often unstable families. They are still minors, and the French educational system is required to accept them -- even if they're in the country illegally. They must be brought up to speed before being integrated into general or specific areas of study. This is a year where they must find their bearings, adapt to French culture and determine what their future will be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/osAhC6hEs3WyCvTDLCJBoHsftun.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enfants valises","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
