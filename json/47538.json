Instead, Blind Guardian decided to create their own festival, back in their homeland. The First Blind Guardian Festival was held in Coburg, Germany, at June 16â€“17, 2003. It lasted 2 days, with the band playing during both nights. The entire show has been professionally recorded and subsequently released on a DVD entitled Imaginations through the Looking Glass in June 14, 2004.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/wThiTfbvJfWX1nTnvnMal4t9AnS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Guardian: Imaginations Through the Looking Glass","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":7}
