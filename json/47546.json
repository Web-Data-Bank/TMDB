One views the money you earned as yours and best allocated by you; the other believes that an elite in Washington knows best how to allocate your wealth. One champions the traditional American dream, which has played out millions of times through generations of Americans, of improving one's lot in life and even daring to dream and build big. The other holds that there is no end to the \"good\" the government can do by taking and spending other peoples' money in an ever-burgeoning list of programs. The documentary film I Want Your Money exposes the high cost in lost freedom and in lost opportunity to support a Leviathan-like bureaucratic state.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/ukFRXI9Dg9JdjebQPFde7Gfel3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The film contrasts two views of role that the federal government should play in our daily lives using the words and actions of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama.","title":"I Want Your Money","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6}
