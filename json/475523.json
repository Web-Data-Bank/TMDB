Though there is plenty of action arising from the various passions and grudges scattered among these characters, the opera is best appreciated as a feast of beautiful and dramatic Italianate singing. With virtuosic roles for a quartet of principals, the opera delivers one feat of heroic vocalism after another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9GbdoCHrOUxfXLFEW9NrLelCgCN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Great Performances at the Metropolitan Opera","title":"Ernani","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
