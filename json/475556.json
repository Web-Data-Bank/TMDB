Jovanović, actress M. Zupančič and actors R. Polič and B. Cavazza. This is a story of a love triangle and of a multi-layered, entirely overt intertwining of protagonists’ public artistic personas and their personal lives. The film documents a 4-month process of the making of a theatre piece from the first rehearsal to the opening night, at the same time uncovering the intimate lives of the artists and telling a universal story of the relationship between the real and the imagined, a story of personal and public perceptions of art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sLzRK9rNODHURyQvnCzJXQfNVid.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23084,"logo_path":"/9mcikqGo4XjxS5t1w97FIoYeD0C.png","name":"Vertigo","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":82448,"logo_path":null,"name":"NP7","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2017-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Good Story Is a Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
