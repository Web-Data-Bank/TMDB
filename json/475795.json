We witness Chastity’s journey through the eloquence of incoherence. It's about the illusion of significance in a surreal, unjust and often unintelligible world, yet finding meaning within it and retaining a form of hope in despite of it. Chastity finds an uncompromising way of realizing reality is a kind of absurdity.","popularity":0.632,"poster_path":"/izsAUhCeN83X8Iy5oLua0VG8Zh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82469,"logo_path":"/qrmls7RvN6iT4tNgFiqfUFRcXcK.png","name":"Ways \u0026 Means","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cabiria, Charity, Chastity","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
