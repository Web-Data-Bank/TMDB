These are the characters taken from the real world and transferred into a film that is first of all a shadowing of human beings, of their hopes and little acts of cowardice. But it is also the story of a time of waiting, of a soul going around in circles, a coming of age in a desolate and oppressive, marginal context that becomes a character in its own right.","popularity":1.23,"poster_path":"/4cS3mNVLzecBvvyKqe0MtmvdoQT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bibi Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manuel","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":20}
