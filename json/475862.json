Rosario is a street vendor, a gitane of village fairs, who gives away soft toys to whoever draws a winning number. The war he has declared against his own destiny has the immature and indolent body of his thirteen-year-old daughter: Sharon is pretty and can sing, and in this hotbed of stopgaps and desperate living, sheâ€™s his weapon for survival. But success becomes an obsession, and talent becomes a punishment.","popularity":1.021,"poster_path":"/7NjlMzoAQ0ScWNZ08KWzFxl7YN6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105719,"logo_path":null,"name":"TFilm","origin_country":""},{"id":16957,"logo_path":"/pZkfDLQKeLwoUj7hW7XuGlTx0T8.png","name":"Britdoc Foundation","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crater","video":false,"vote_average":5.577,"vote_count":13}
