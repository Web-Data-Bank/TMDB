The legacy left to them is a violent, depraved narrative of murderous dominion over the weak. But still, enemies muscling their way into this realm of the wretched. These apparently harmless enemies are nevertheless viewed as potential usurpers by Ciccio and Ciruzzo, who, alienated by their imposed surroundings, develop a deep paranoia towards two animals: Severino, leader of the famous donkeys of Campu Perdu, and Piero, top boar around the Olive field area. The day of reckoning is near. There has to be a showdown. They have to get rid of the two animals. There's no way around it. A letter is delivered. A Pinter-like ultimatum with a crystal-clear demand: it's you or us. Men or animals. Coexistence is out of the question. Power has room for only one big chief. The final, inevitable apocalypse draws near.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kPvg3tHBORXcCA1qoz4jQIgcklY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terranera","origin_country":""},{"id":88415,"logo_path":"/eILTlrcolO64UUvODgfKtvgNLcH.png","name":"Parallelo 41","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MeanMinds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
