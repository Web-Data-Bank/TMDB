He's putting in long hours at the office so they can live comfortably and has a tendency to drink too much to unwind after work. As a result, he's no longer able to satisfy his wife the way he once did, which leads to her questioning whether she's somehow to blame. One fateful night, the tensions between them erupt. Frustrations are vented as insults are hurled in both directions. Each of them fantasizes of what might have been had they not married one another. Somewhere along the way, imagination gives way to memories of how they first met and fell in love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m98gBMOmG1k6n5Xks1xjgI09Afw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75804,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artimi Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touch Me in the Morning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
