Director Francois Abou Salem brings a modern Middle Eastern sensibility to this journey into Arabian and Muslim culture, filtering the comic tale of abduction for today's audiences. Soprano Christine Schafer portrays Constanze, a woman whose heart is torn between her fiance, Belmonte (Paul Groves), and her new master, Pasha Selim (Akram Tillawi). A sensual and resoundingly modern experience, this new interpretation casts new light on a classic musical work and infuses it with aching human emotion.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/302e3jcE31ONURKOtODSpG8yDGL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15790,"logo_path":null,"name":"BelAir Media","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1997-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: Die Entführung Aus Dem Serail","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
