It was produced at the request of sportswear maker Adidas as a part of its \"Adicolor\" viral ads campaign, in which advertising agency Idealogue gathered seven directors, assigning a different color to each of them, and asked them to produce a feature based on their emotional and creative response to the given color, later to be distributed in the form of podcasts.  The four-minute film, shot by Trent Opaloch in Blomkamp's usual handheld camera mockumentary style, deals with an Israeli robotic globe-trotter gone rogue.","popularity":0.911,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4545,"logo_path":null,"name":"RSA Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adicolor Yellow","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":16}
