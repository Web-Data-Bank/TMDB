In the fragments of conversations captured in the Maputo market, a recording studio and on coconut trees, we find daily routines and tedium lead to chit-chat on desire, money and hope. In the interplay between performance and document, poetry emerges from fleeting everyday moments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mxBr9NHX4ahyttMyiI1IwZbjIYE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Portuguese film agency","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MZ","name":"Mozambique"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2017-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching Nafta","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
