They work the family land, and also weave towels. Trieu's husband Dai returns to the village, after a four year absence, to ask Trieu for a divorce, because he has started a business in Hanoi with his girlfriend. Trieu refuses, but Dai leaves her ten pieces of gold and the divorce papers to sign. After a row with Toan, the local towel buyer, Trieu manages to sell the cloth to the distributors herself, and uses the gold to set up a weavers co-op.
