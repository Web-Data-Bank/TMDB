The youngest of them wanted to shorten his way through the high mountains. However, he did not manage to take off higher with the burden. He tripped on one of the sharp shields and all his beauty was scattered across the surrounding valleys. The ancient Slavs gave the wild mountains full of game and superstition the name of the Tatras. Today we know that they are the smallest mountains in the world. Try to look carefully into their kingdom with us. Quietly look around and let your thoughts be carried away by the majesty of nature. You may touch the knowledge of how everything relates to everything in this world. And maybe you will understand your responsibility to preserve the wilderness, which should remain here for future generations as if frozen in time.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/7b1JmI77yv3anssOTJEiJRMqiLP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmos Factory","origin_country":""},{"id":87343,"logo_path":null,"name":"ORF Universum","origin_country":""},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High Tatras – Wilderness Frozen in Time","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
