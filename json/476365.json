Who am I?“ In a box brimming with countless letters and postcards, Walo Deuber one day finds the only remaining memories of his scarcely known and long forgotten father, Emil. His parents’ marriage fell apart when Walo was still a young boy in the 50s and his father decided to move to South Africa. Sixty years later, Walo decides to trace his father’s footsteps, setting off on an uncertain adventure that leads him from Namibia to Zambia. He uses a first person narrative to create his own account of this hardly known yet increasingly important person. GIRAFFEN MACHEN ES NICHT ANDERS is a film about the glue which, above and beyond genetics, holds humans together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fqJDDnnurVP3QBlj7oS2o4zDSyE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giraffes Don't Do It Any Differently – a film about fathers and family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
