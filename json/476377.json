The lawless province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -- considered the gateway for terrorists from neighboring Afghanistan -- is the backdrop of our film. The battle for control of this porous border area remains critical to the stability of Pakistan and global security. Should Pakistan, a nuclear power, fall into the hands of terrorists, the entire world is at risk. We witness firsthand the dangerous struggle undertaken by the men of the KPK BDU to protect their country against the Taliban threat in the land they both call home.","popularity":1.444,"poster_path":"/xZ7u5yH6XbloE6t7gpVUylfzqDf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Pushto","iso_639_1":"ps","name":"پښتو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Armed with Faith","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
