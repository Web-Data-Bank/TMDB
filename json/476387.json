She destroys old correspondence, cleans her apartment by putting furniture in the street, and looks back on her life (as revealed via flashbacks and a film crew interviewing her daughters). Caroline's brief marriage to an Englishman gave her one daughter, successful businesswoman Rachel (Domini Blythe), and an affair with a rebel in the Congo resulted in her other daughter Myriam (Sheila Rose). Further memories rise to the surface when Caroline joins her long-time friend Maureen (France Castel) for a black-tie reception where their community work in Africa brings them an Order of Canada award.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aRHlxqNvkAyOrAhuJuLjnZPALNa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When I Will Be Gone...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
