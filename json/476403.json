One morning Lars encounters Morgan (Rob Lee) in Karis' kitchen; Morgan is her future ex-husband and a policeman with a violent temper who begins a campaign of intimidation to make Lars stop seeing Karis. But wait: 30 minutes into the movie the point-of-view changes to Morgan's, and we see he's not such a bad guy after all and that Lars is the hot-tempered villain. But wait: 30 minutes later the point of view switches to Karis, and it turns out that she hasn't been completely honest about things.
