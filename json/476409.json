Rupert is a stuffy lawyer who has emigrated to Canada, while Dale ekes out a living dealing drugs. Along the way, they find themselves stranded in a commune where their father once lived, populated by a pack of half hippie/half redneck dropouts who like to get high on mushrooms and drive trucks. George Wendt appears in a supporting role.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Jj6UIIw3qIrmcAkYSw4WtWv4Fx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rupert's Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
