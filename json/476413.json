Flirtatious Sirsa (Pálína Jónsdottir) marries Harald (Dofri Hermannsson), son of a wealthy landowner on the island.\r Offshore, a ship is sinking, so the men form a rescue party, returning with the captain, the engineer, and several sailors. With a storm gathering, the engineer dies. The clergyman requests an end to the festivities as a mark of respect. Sirsa protests, but her new husband brings the celebration to a halt. The group then fragments into different activities, drunken or otherwise, and the sensual Sirsa directs her attention toward the handsome Ívar (Baldur Trausti Hreinsson).\r The film's score features traditional folk music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gNE8RFn8dHlvTDOdWUFPWPICdY2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14935,"logo_path":null,"name":"IsFilm","origin_country":"IS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1998-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dance","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
