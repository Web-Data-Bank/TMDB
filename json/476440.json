N. Roy. Founder of a communist party in Zapata's Mexico, leader of the Communist International in Soviet Russia alongside Lenin, anti-Stalinist and anti-Nazi activist in pre-war Germany, politician and atheist philosopher in post-independence India, Roy embodies the struggles of a century that he crossed on three continents.
