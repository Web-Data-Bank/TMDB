Based on a real-life recording, Sweet Childhood is a playful animated short with two narrators—namely, the Zvianes of past and present. Guided by her own voice from 30 years ago, the celebrated author of Les deuxièmes employs a range of techniques to evoke the naïve charm of children’s drawings, giving graphic form to her quirky, youthful narrative. The result is a hilarious short that questions just how “sweet” childhood really is. A slice of everyday life, courtesy of the Comic Strip Chronicles.","popularity":1.098,"poster_path":"/9tSZORa3K72H8qSZsRIndThuiEk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Childhood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
