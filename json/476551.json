Parents Bob and Fran have worked their fingers to the bone and with their four children grown and ready to fly the nest it might be time to relax and enjoy the roses. But the changing seasons bring home some shattering truths.  Featuring Frantic Assembly’s celebrated physicality, and co-directed by Frantic Assembly’s Tony and Olivier Award nominated Artistic Director Scott Graham and State Theatre Company’s Artistic Director Geordie Brookman, Things I Know To Be True is a complex and intense study of the mechanics of a family that is both poetic and brutally frank.","popularity":0.891,"poster_path":"/9rxWYC852csU87PcCeHj4guOHWe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things I Know to be True","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
