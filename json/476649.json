As a result, however, his apartment has become an unlivable and unsanitary place. He goes out to find some cleaning supplies, only to find himself lost in a city he no longer knows. By shear happenstance, he bumps into an old friend, a world-class cut-up, who takes him to a place of importance to their past. There, Schweitzer realizes he must reconcile with the brother he has not spoken to and has refused to understand for most of his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6qkFfhYtxVF6m3LLQVWiV55qQA9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The past is like a man whistling sayonara.","title":"A Trip to Swadades","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
