Atypical not only because of its technical specs, but because of its narrative structure. There are several scenes with only the city in common, and more as a conceptual presence at that than as a precise geography. None of those scenes contains a single \"story\": Each one of them is part of a larger situation that we cannot see, as though the beginning and end of each \"story\" had to be filled in by the audience.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/9clPJss1NTR3zJsuKvBI3M1ybvR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11999,"logo_path":"/50K9W66YeWjOalNcjWddPcSgIYO.png","name":"Universidad del Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2006-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Buenos Aires","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
