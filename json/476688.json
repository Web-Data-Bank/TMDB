Klaus Mann (John Gross), a present-day Philadelphia avatar of the real-life European author of Mephisto, lives in the shadow of his father, the eminent intellectual, novelist and Nobel Laureate Thomas Mann (Ernst Hohmann). When Klaus pens a controversial essay on \"revolutionary suicide\" and then acts on it, in protest of the world's selfishness, a group of his contemporaries speak up in filmed interviews about what led him down that path. It is a film about the creative process, the tragic depiction of a strained father-son relationship and, most of all, it is a film about individuality.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/345is7Zri9P8IHZB7pN3QextE3M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Klaus Mann had a short life...and a long death.","title":"Sophisticated Acquaintance","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
