When famed composer Lluis Doria (Laurent Terzieff) visits a transvestite club, he learns his lifelong friend Albert Rossell (Serge Reggiani) is the house pianist. A flashback takes the tale four decades into the past where the younger Rossell (Pere Ponce) rejoins Teresa (Paulina Galvez) after having spent years in prison for helping anti-Franco anarchists. The story continues into Paris of the '30s, the period when Doria and Rossell first met, sharing a mutual interest in music and Teresa, before civil war sent them in different directions.","popularity":3.199,"poster_path":"/3ZLo0rib2nM6a68twn5IafhqUQU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20786,"logo_path":null,"name":"Massa d'Or Produccions","origin_country":""},{"id":7680,"logo_path":"/uGcInOaHyvFZ337T5OeQKKVjSCJ.png","name":"Tornasol Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1998-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pianist","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
