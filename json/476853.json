In 1979, Bill Viola and Frank Caliguri dreamed up a contest pitting barroom bigmouths against wrestlers, martial artists, boxers, bouncers and brawlers, billed as no-holds-barred new type of competitive fighting. When the fights succeeded beyond their wildest expectations, they were swept up in a chain of events that ended in the first mixed-martial arts ban in the nation.  “Tough Guys” chronicles the inception of Caliguri and Viola’s first bouts and the colorful, crazy cast of fighters who made them a hit as well as the politicians who brought it all crashing down. The film brings to life a moment when the national martial arts craze was building to a crescendo as the economies of Pennsylvania steel towns were plummeting to levels of unemployment never seen, breeding desperate men looking for a chance to prove their worth and make some money in the ring.","popularity":1.585,"poster_path":"/sq5UDkTLGrEVpBiF8zaQTqWYMJv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warrior Poets","origin_country":"US"},{"id":95201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fictionless","origin_country":""},{"id":95202,"logo_path":null,"name":"MinusL Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tough Guys","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
