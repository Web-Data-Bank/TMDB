Protagonists Simon Reggiani and Patricia Mazuy are also husband and wife in real life. They filmed the creation of one of Simon’s plays, and then reenacted some of the events surrounding it. Simon prepares for a one-man show that he will perform largely on horseback, including dressage. The local government of the region hopes to use the play to improve its image; with government’s support, it’s decided that Simon will perform the play before an audience of over 1,700 farmers during an agricultural congress in Paris. The director of a large stud farm provides Simon with rehearsal space. What follows is the path that Reggiani had to take in order to create his performance — a path filled with obstacles ranging from uncooperative stable staff and a grumpy horse to vocal problems. An intriguing and occasionally absurd mixture of filmed theater, a making-of documentary, mockumentary and dressage lesson.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hoERqM71nxA8xUkaduYKLWI34vq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Basse Normandie","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
