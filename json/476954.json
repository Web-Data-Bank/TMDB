Jahrhundert","overview":"German director Gordian Maugg creates this curious documentary/reenactment of the life of Hans Warn, adventuring sailor-turned-photographer. Born in Bremen in 1899, the young Hans signs on to the good ship Herbert in 1914, but not before he persuades his mother to buy him a camera. What starts as a hobby soon develops into a passion. Soon Hans is documenting his life on the high seas and his ship's six-month capture during World War I. Later, Hans marries the girl next door, Wilma, but their family life is sporadic because of his seafaring career. Maugg uses a wide palette of cinematic tricks and devices to recall the early years of the century, including sepia tinting, decorative intertitles, distressed footage, and other idioms of early silent documentaries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yahnNFO6d77Y1hwau5TYUqLkw9S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hans Warns: My 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
