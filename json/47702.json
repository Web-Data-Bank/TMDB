His wife and mother-in-law are also awaiting the super payout, but they have different ideas as to how the money should be spent. The usually submissive and calm Pandelis suddenly decides to react...  Philippides does a sterling job as the long-suffering Pandelis and his vicissitudes leave one with a warm feeling.
