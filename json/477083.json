In 2002 while shooting Caribs' Leap in Grenada, McQueen met and filmed a young man called Ashes, but the footage was not used. Many years later he learned that Ashes had been killed. McQueen decided to create a tribute to him, combining old and new footage. On one side of the screen, Ashes is full of life, his boat moving towards a seemingly unending horizon. The other side shows his tomb being constructed and the etching of a memorial plaque for his grave. Over the soundtrack, two local men tell the story of Ashes's untimely death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vDAqstx7CPVNKPvAM57s29YKjBs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
