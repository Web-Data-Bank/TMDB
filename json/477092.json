In the deserted plains of Bácska a living soul cannot be found in a few-days’ walk. Three former prisoners returning from their Turkish captivity – Long-Legged, Lame and One-Eyed – appear among the crumbling walls of a huge abandoned church without a roof. They are looking for their long lost home. How to revive a disappeared civilization? What is the survivors’ personal duty? Without a roof, a collapse is inevitable. The Old Man – a master of ancient knowledge – and his daughter come and with sharing sowing seeds they try to save the community of dispersion. No spiritual leader, no aims. Driven by rapacity, One-Eyed kills the Old Man, rapes his daughter and while looking for the remaining seeds he kills Long-Legged with a sudden anger. At the end of the film, the survivors need to face with dramatic encounters and special temptations. Their redemption under the leadership of Lame’s young son is the pledge for the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c42ZLod5yCxsGsCmMUTgnpyQfvE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Újvidék","origin_country":""},{"id":95231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hábermann Jenő-FilmArt","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2017-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Month of Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
