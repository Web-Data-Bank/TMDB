He's bored with his job, gets passed over for a promotion and, when the pressures get to be too much, he tries to commit suicide, but he even fails at that and manages only to cripple himself instead of killing himself. Forced to stay at home, he finds the role of \"househusband\" enjoyable--until his wife takes a low-paying job with his old company, and rapidly rises up the corporate ladder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hCVCOblL6vbnqHiJUdmE6YeqNqu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It will start a discussion!","title":"The Home Maker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
