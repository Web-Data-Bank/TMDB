As the film opens, Teno examines a pro-government rally in Bandjourn where a young man was nearly killed by a mob for stealing chickens. As we look deeper into \"justice\" in Cameroon, we discover vigilante murder is commonplace; wife beating is tolerated by the law; freedom of the press does not exist; those who violate the many \"laws\" on the books are faced with inhuman prison conditions; and bribery is the most common method of dealing with the authorities. While activists continue to battle for justice and peace, Chef! makes clear that the road before them is long and steep.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3u9mkNP29CRVjqD3jfjB0yWgXkW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chef!","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
