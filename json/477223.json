Safaa Fathy filmed the reflections of the sky on the liquid surface at the pace of one second every half-hour, from morning to evening every day. Time passes and leaves its mark on fixed shots. The voice of Jacques Derrida reads a poem written by Safaa Fathy, translated from the Arabic by Zeinad Zaza and Derrida himself. Between sound and image, interior and exterior, this film invites us to travel in the density of time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60707,"logo_path":null,"name":"editions Montparnasse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nom à la mer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
