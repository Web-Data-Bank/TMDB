This video follows the pair of French artists for one year as they team to concoct their patented bizarre and beautiful imaginary world in pictures, often conflating gay, Hollywood, and religious iconography. They've attracted as models such international celebrities and stars as Michael Jackson, Nina Hagen, Madonna, Boy George, Mark Almond, Catherine Deneuve, Rupert Everett, Jean-Paul Gaultier, and Prince. Some critics dismiss their work as simply kitsch, while some of the world's top art galleries have held shows celebrating the duo's work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sQFHCbEeImsW9rkZFHKmKuuefys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pierre and Gilles, Love Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
