Director Michael Hampe envisions La Cenerentola less as a fairy tale and more as a gently satirical comment on the nature of society and the relationship between people. Conductor Riccardo Chailly's masterly display of the Rossini style is visually matched by the opulent and elegant set designs by Mauro Pagano. 162 minutes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g7ivPhAuQZVo53NhqexDo6ELfET.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66385,"logo_path":null,"name":"ORF Enterprise","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1988-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":162,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Cenerentola","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
