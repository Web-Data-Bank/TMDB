Based on a true story, this eloquent and unflinching film charts the journey of a young boy from a war torn Uganda to his days as a soldier with the Ugandan insurgency of 1979, to his HIV positive diagnosis in Cuba, to a present day jail cell in Texas. Ultimately, what we discover is a man who in the face of adversity will do anything to survive, even if it means going to hell.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biro","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
