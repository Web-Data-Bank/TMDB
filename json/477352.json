Today, we recognize that these types of projects, financed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), have served to enrich U.S. corporations while creating crippling debt for these countries, effectively turning them into American client states. Experiencing a change of heart, Perkins resigned from the business in 1981. After running a utility company, he founded the nonprofit organization, Dream Change Coalition, which works closely with Amazonian and other indigenous people to help preserve their environments and cultures. Take the time for a conversation with Perkins about globalization and inequality around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uxGd591skvcQKaqlI6seiXzy5ma.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speaking Freely Volume 1: John Perkins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
