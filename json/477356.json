In stark frankness, McGovern examines the politicization of the Central Intelligence Agency and how it came to be an entity that serves the White House agenda, instead of one that serves up the unbiased truth. Disgusted by the lack of integrity exhibited by members of the intelligence community and U.S. government, McGovern retired and eventually co-created VIPS (Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity)-an organization dedicated to exposing the mishandling of important intelligence, particularly with regard to the War on Iraq. Full of inside information you have never heard before about the way in which our nation's most secretive agency operates.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speaking Freely Volume 3: Ray Mcgovern","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
