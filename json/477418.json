The unmarried girls remain in the village amoung the elderly folk, meeting together to embroider their trousseaus and chat. In a rural Greek community, it is not the role of women to express their point of view in public. The film allows the spectator to sit in one of these casual sewing sessions where the girls talk about their wishes and problems, most of which revolve around marriages that will change their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Educational Resources","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Women in a Rural Greek Community","title":"Thread of the Needle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
