Instead, she terrorizes any shop owner foolish enough to audition her labor. In a throwback to the third episode, where she apprentices for a milliner, Titine drops a carton of fancy hats that are crushed by a steamroller. Then she throws a cake at the baker’s best customer and insults a woman with large feet at the shoe store.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gkfZmC0IfBlmWProskSg2pKmAto.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1910-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Léontine’s Apprenticeship","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
