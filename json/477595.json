In one of poorest regions of the country, where women rarely have the chance to speak out, a courageous group of twenty-three women produce a film about an issue that has affected them all, but few will discuss: the plight of young women, orphaned by AIDS. Inspired by the strength of Penelop, a young woman who agrees to share her story on film, the group becomes a force for change, showing how a single story can unite an entire community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xdX05JS3gsVjqht5lYZhrz9NVb1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the Water Meets the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
