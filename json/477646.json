In an enigmatic ritual of identity, Jonas performs as herself and as her masked double, Organic Honey. Dressed in a feathered headdress and costumes, Organic Honey is the embodiment of artifice, masquerade and narcissism — a female alter-ego whose guise is a frozen doll's face. This elliptical, nonlinear narrative performance explores themes that are emblematic of Jonas' early video work: The study of female gestures and archetypes, both personal and cultural; the use of disguise and masquerade, ritual objects and ritualized self-examination; and an inquiry into subjectivity and objectivity. The work's formal elements — the layering of mirrors and mirrored images, manipulations of reflective space and spatial ambiguity, and the use of drawing to add a further layering of meaning — are also Jonas' signatures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cZVI8VOw1kThf8pBC84dKXlLxPf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Organic Honey's Visual Telepathy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
