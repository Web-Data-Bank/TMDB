During his visits to the hospital, Itzhak, a beaten and reserved man, is frustrated to find himself neglected by his own family: his wife, a long suppressed artist whose life's dream is fulfilled that same week; his twenty-seven-year-old son - a \"philosopher\" still living at home; and his twenty-five-year-old daughter - a tormented lesbian who has had no contact with her family for a long time. Itzhak doesn't realize, though, that his ten year old daughter, Didush, neglected and almost invisible to her family, is secretly visiting her grandfather whom she has never met previously and sets out to discover the old family secret.","popularity":0.652,"poster_path":"/zE4aJoy9W3kexlaHASB8U2MeJRP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paralight Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":4520,"logo_path":"/cbTP5NRekgyIdIWjKCULenRF3p0.png","name":"Israeli Film Fund","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2006-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things Behind the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
