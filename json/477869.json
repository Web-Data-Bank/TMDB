The sweeping narrative of Il Fiacre n. 13 was mutilated by the Italian censor’s suppression of its first part, the most cynical episode, which sets the scene for a scheme discernable in the other three episodes, as the story develops from a sordid murder through plotting and deceit to finally reach a happy ending.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4WV6RhoWW1rvvuPrwyN3S2lS9Nm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1917-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cab Number 13","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
