Using a laborious traditional system to mount the details of each image, this cinematic event gradually unfolds over the 72-minute film, offering a slow contemplative consideration of political violence as a counterpoint to the rapid barrage of images we typically experience in our news media. Despite its slow, nearly meditative pace, Baudelaire creates a haunting and provocative work that completely absorbs the viewer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wTB9nA3ZhnPEmXRzEyBmsREje7t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sugar Water","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
