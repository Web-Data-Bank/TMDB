Sikandar and Shab are final-year art students at Kabul University, both with a thirst for life. Amidst the ruins of war-torn Kabul, the couple and their friends spot an abandoned cinema, which miraculously survived 30 years of war. As an act of resistance against the looming return of fundamentalism, a bold dream is enacted and renovation work on the cinema begins. Serious problems soon arise: the withdrawal of powerful family support, the targeting of Shab by her extremist brother, an auto accident and a calamitous fire. Undaunted, Sikandar continues to pursue the dream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kAO924UyvZRHe3jNB9JUWv5podf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taimani Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"}],"release_date":"2017-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kabullywood","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":5}
