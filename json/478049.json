Today, much of this area, swept by sand winds, is contaminated. Radioactivity can not be seen and the population is not aware of the risks. This exploitation completely disorganized the life of the population.  Part of the year, violent sand winds completely envelop the city. This wind of dust propagates radioactive substances. Everyone is looking for shelter. The city becomes calm, all activities are stopped.  My father, a retired uranium mine worker, is at the heart of this film. He will dust off his memories, the 35 years of his passage to the mine. Thanks to my father, I go to meet other former workers who certainly have a say.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cOmdfIt4rN5LB7br5ac53Gi8SYt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Colère dans le vent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
