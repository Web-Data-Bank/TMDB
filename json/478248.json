Meanwhile, powerful Hutu leaders have had enough of Tutsi rebels and call on all Hutus to kill their Tutsi neighbors. As chaos breaks out, the Tutsis flee and the lovers are separated. Josette and her family find solace in a Catholic church run by a sadistic priest. The Catholic Church, the state, and the French army look the other way as bloodshed ensues. Josette is taken as a \"wife\" by the priest and repeatedly raped. When the Belgian army sent in to protect the church is called away on an emergency, the Hutus attack and massacre hundreds of women and children. Josette miraculously survives, but she is only a husk of the woman that she was. As the Tutsis regroup, they exact terrible revenge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v4pVBW5Ihq2UX8LIUVGDlCPHSSc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RW","name":"Rwanda"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"100 Days","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
