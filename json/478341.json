The footage was smuggled out and edited two years later in London, and officially released in 1966 to critical acclaim. Shot by Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges (THE READER, LOCAL HERO, THE KILLING FIELDS), this documentary short is an important historical artifact, representing the only known footage of armed Tibetan resistance fighters in combat with the Chinese.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oIbOu710kaXP7DnJfb9cI7FFkzI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raid Into Tibet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
