Beautiful and volatile Ryoko is unlike anybody he’s ever met before. She barrages into one of his lectures, demanding to know why he only talks of sex, not love, before declaring her own affection. It’s the first of many inappropriate acts by Ryoko and the start of a relationship that is by turns sweet, strange and toxic. Ryoko hopes that she and Kuma’s love can change the world. What she fails to realise is that sometimes it’s the small gestures, not the grand ones, that feel most revolutionary.","popularity":1.079,"poster_path":"/d49ZaAmLeXM0yODd1wRVIQxb3s7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1780,"logo_path":"/jdnvUiU7I3Uf2ig0VZNNjf0ORRL.png","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perfect Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
