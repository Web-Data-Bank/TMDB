Notorious businessman Santiago Ordenez (Juan Luis Galiardo), who primarily goes by the nickname Dulzara, operates a high-profile club/casino with the protection of some local politicians with whom he has dubious relationships. A large portion of the club's success is due to its star singer, Rosa (Luisa Maria Jiminez), who also happens to be Dulzara's lover. Rosa, however, has recently started into another affair with a somewhat younger womanizer named Marcos (Abel Rodriguez).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/knYblXQ89GY7gLa1oucgNYpztSz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosa la China","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
