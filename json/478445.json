They are women who work, who have children, and who, at the same time, keep their independence of mind. I shot 24 portraits of 13 minutes each. I have chosen this short running time for several reasons: not becoming a bother, escape tv adds cuts, shoot the movie quickly, in one pace and without too many scratches. I am not a documentaries maker. I am more like a faces, hands and things lover. To show reality is not my goal. “Reality” is just a word, just like its twin sister “fiction”, which I practice as well, but with a different delight.\" (Alain Cavalier)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/SOmxvQhU1L6gTlfduUmS5Ule4g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95533,"logo_path":null,"name":"Douce","origin_country":""},{"id":6454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caméra One","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portraits: Première Série","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
