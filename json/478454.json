Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the first president of Georgia, elected by the majority of votes, was driven into exile by coup d'etat. Even though he returned to regain power soon after, political clashes once again forced him to flee into the mountains. Based on the final chapter of the first President's life, the film starts off by following his journey accompanied and pursued by both friend and foe.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/oKGMbOdQ1DkQ5D0QGoYQ2G1qvow.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alamdary Film","origin_country":"GE"},{"id":100770,"logo_path":"/luIygU2xWB6vSVQKCxgdXEb8FTA.png","name":"42film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":87271,"logo_path":"/tXxU8K5C9HoApztCgBb7OgmxTPd.png","name":"Arizona Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Khibula","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
