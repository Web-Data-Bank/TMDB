The hero is willing to give everything and suffer whatever it takes in order to conquer the football world. With his talent as his only weapon, he tries to define his destiny, on a route from Thessaloniki, to Volos and from there to Athens. With him, we taste the mud of the fields, the loneliness of the countryside, the \"sold out\" matches, but also the ephemeral glow of success. Pantelis Voulgaris signs a film that left an era, as, in addition to its original directorial perspective, it outlines the phenomenon of Greek football in a poetic and at the same time realistic way.","popularity":1.33,"poster_path":"/26Cw0e9ZVVvCADpEDu2BTXiDVLA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/x5m947rMvwJbNpoGil5W76dIJjB.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Striker with Number 9","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":8}
