While in college she meets and becomes close to Rajib, a drug dealer. Developing an intense hatred for men, inspired by her violent and insensitive father, she identifies as a lesbian. Her introduction to the drug-scene engulfs her and she develops a cocaine habit which rapidly accelerates into a preference for White China heroin. She meets and falls in love with Rajibs ex drug-dealing partner, Vela, who has already become a hardcore junkie. Her and Vela's downward spiral into chronic addiction is portrayed powerfully throughout the film as is their intense attachment to each other. The plot (based on a true story) is exceptional in its depiction of the drug problems in Indonesia, the often terrible 'solutions' to these problems, and the reasons behind why they occur.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Mms2XvbjzAHsIY1DSqB0KXfi1Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72727,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indika Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2005-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A TRAGIC LOVE STORY","title":"Last Second","video":false,"vote_average":0.8,"vote_count":2}
