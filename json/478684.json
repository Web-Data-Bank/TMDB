The river and salmon have weathered decades of over-fishing, abusive logging, catastrophic floods, droughts and a hydro power dam that diverts water out of basin. Today the Eel’s recovering wild salmon compete for water with the region’s multi-billion dollar underground cannabis economy and the wine industries of Sonoma and Mendocino, California.  This film is rooted in the belief that we can live symbiotically with our watersheds and encourage both a river’s recovery and economic future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pR0VFkMLdBGuRVohTiryiEa0yZO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exploring the legacy of California's Eel River and searching for an economic and ecologic balance.","title":"A River's Last Chance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
