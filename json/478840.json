Subsequently, we get to know Ernest Menville, an undertaker, who shall help to renew the battered bodies of his immortal ex-wifes in DEATH BECOMES HER.  Our eerie tour then leads us to Disney's PHANTOM MANOR, the settlement of Cuesta Verde, in which a POLTERGEIST walks abroad, and the fabulous world of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. In the film set of PERFUME - THE STORY OF A MURDERER we will be bewitched by a perfect perfume and later on we find ourself in Paris, to reveal the enigmatic DA VINCI CODE. We then witness the curious transformation of BENJAMIN BUTTON, finally ending in the midst of THE OMEN, where the fallen angel casts a spell over us. In the second part of our concert we honor our these yearâ€™s laureate for the MAX STEINER FILM MUSIC ACHIEVEMENT AWARD 2015, James Newton Howard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q7M6lNrpXK6fLFMussaRW39E66g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood in Vienna 2015: Tales of Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
