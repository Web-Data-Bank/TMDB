It tells the story of one Dark Freeman (Jason Bonner), a young African American man who finds himself torn between his tough urban roots - living as a resident on the impoverished, crime-ridden south side of Chicago - and his day-to-day life, in the comparatively wealthy and privileged University of Chicago, where he is enrolled as a student. Walking between the two worlds, Freeman must find a way to succeed in both, with the help of lovers, family members, close friends and acquaintances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nTRNfA9gU8Kh4o5bU7UA24H37Uh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120301,"logo_path":null,"name":"33 Degrees","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
