Sure, it's a little crazy, but the acting is a big cut above most martial arts movies and the sword fights are pretty good. And Sam the Seed shows up, sans wig, as a dirtbag Shaolin monk after the book. Han Ying Chieh, the big boss, is one of the thugs in the background.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qyKBzpHnfrfGF54omJDlfVmJT5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cathay Organisation (HK) (1965) Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1969-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iron Bones","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
