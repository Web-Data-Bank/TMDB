She releases their prisoners, leading her vengeful half-sister Abigaille to plot to take power. Nabucco declares himself a god and is struck by a bolt of lightning.  Abigaille tricks the now feeble king into signing a death warrant for the Israelites, including Fenena and Ismaele. Nabucco prays to the God of Israel for forgiveness; his sanity is restored and he saves the prisoners from death. He converts himself and his people, while Abigaille commits suicide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3O3hWQvWKNqgd2fA5VITjeiQ266.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The ROH Live: Nabucco","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
