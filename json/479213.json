Sporting the latest fashions and trendy hairdos, they naïvely observe and criticise the modern consumer society, advertising, fancy boats and summer cottages, country dances, barbecues, and any other phenomena that were supposed to bother angry young intellectuals in those days. The plot and the political agenda are delivered with a cheerful, tongue-in-cheek mixture of documentary observations, fake TV commercials, fake interviews, philosophical voiceovers and titles, and a jazzy soundtrack by the progressive rock group Wigwam.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d1DjNbDMYEx4WDmPqVrjuGJ6ls3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filminor","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":38212,"logo_path":null,"name":"FJ-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1970-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kesäkapina","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
