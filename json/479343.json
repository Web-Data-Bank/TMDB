This sort of proto-film was born not as a film, but as a photograph; I caused it to transmigrate—using a horizontal scanning motion of the filmstrip typical of photo-finish—into a film, thus betraying its natural verticality. I rephotographed the photofinish negative through the gate of an old 35mm moviecamera causing it to advance using the crank handle at a velocity interpolated between the crank handle [of the old 35mm moviecamera] and that of my own [16mm] movie camera. I was interested in seeing figures transformed which had been destined to remain motionless and to see them reanimated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/spTFk1PpmepbmLVpcU3HAfzmTy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Extremotions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
