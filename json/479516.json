She, the Revolution Hunter, tries to enter in that picture as if she could enter into a time she didn't belong and finally understand what it means to be part of a revolution or what it means to fight for a country.  A film that explores the relationship between two generations, two different times and two different fights. As if we could transform a photograph by drawing on it. As if we could transform the present by drawing over the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wkQNUPkme35htev1qTFVUuJ5e3t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal College of Art","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Revolution Hunter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
