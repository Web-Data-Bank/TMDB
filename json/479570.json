Marking the occasion by taking a self-portrait on a single frame of 16mm film, the resulting reel documents a year in his life at approximately one second per day – a pace that is polar opposite of the enduring length of the original performance. The punch cards, witnessed by a third party for authenticity, and other ephemera, document Hsieh’s life restructured around this highly repetitive task.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7f9AWr6fvZMdArDedHVLtMcdnA9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Clock Piece (One Year Performance 1980–1981)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
