Their everyday life is determined by an attempt to ward off everything modern, a life without electricity, machines and communicative media, a school whose only books are the Bible and the Catechism. Nora Fingscheidt takes this life in the eye and lets it be told by those who live it - in different degrees of devotion. In the process, it is not least apparent how a life-style, which has devoted itself entirely to the departure from this \"world,\" is formed around it. And then, between the pictures and the words, a gap opens, in which the longing for a more destitute life, as well as the fear of a sad departure, becomes perceptible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gzYyJoGf00gNlYdOgSgQKzMuamQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without This World","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
