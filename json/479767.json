More than two hundred years ago, on April 10th 1815, Mount Tambora in Eastern Indonesia became a merciless killer. It unleashed the most deadly volcanic eruption in human memory, wiping out at least 117,000 people. And an entire civilization and its language disappeared. But the killing didn’t stop there. It has now been proven that this eruption could have triggered an extraordinary and little known cataclysmic event: worldwide climate change.","popularity":0.658,"poster_path":"/zJ2p3u6KCeksytJzcu9gV7LdF0G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":129437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leonardo Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Volcano That Changed The World","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
