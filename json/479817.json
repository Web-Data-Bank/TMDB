Rudolf Steiner not only found how to experience these areas directly, in a very safe and methodical manner, but he also developed specific techniques which, if utilized in the right way and with the proper intention, enable the individual to have insight into the spiritual realities.  In addition to learning of this extraordinary individuality, we meet some of the men and women who are utilizing the impulses brought by Dr. Steiner to expand and enhance their specific vocations in very practical ways, e.g. education, agriculture, medicine, astronomy, mathematics, architecture, the arts, and working with retarded children and adults.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nDvBXTihg6ln6cyH3WA4csUYFPv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95865,"logo_path":null,"name":"LightFilled Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dr Rudolf Steiner and the Science of Spiritual Realities","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
