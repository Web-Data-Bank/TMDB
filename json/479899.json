They were initially active from 1978 to 1995 with basically this line-up. Named after the J. G. Ballard short story. They debuted in 1979 with the \"Red Planet\" three-track single. This release attracted Polydor A&R man Frank Neilson and the band signed a three-album recording contract. These three albums - \"Waiting for a Miracle\" (1980), which included the single \"Independence Day\", probably their best known song, \"Sleep No More\" (1981) and \"Fiction\" (1982) - are regarded by some as their best, but only sold modestly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pyArsZVNlLzFhWTrdofCiLogcYs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polydor Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Comsat Angels Live 12-12-1981","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
