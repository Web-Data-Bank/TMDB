Firstly, we board a North West Regional Railways Express (class 156) which traverses the former Furness Railway via Grange-over-Sands and Ulvertston to Barrow-in-Furness.  There we change to a class 153 for the most scenic section of the route along the coast from Bootle to Maryport, filmed in what can only be described as 100% perfect weather - not a cloud in the sky! Apparently you only get one day a year like that along the coast and we were there!  As signalling expert David Allen says in his script; \"this line is a mecca for semaphore signalling enthusiasts\".  Filmed in 1997.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p1RoWdIRVvTcHazhtUbYdfQnWXv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video 125","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1997-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Carnforth to Barrow-in-Furness, Bootle to Maryport","title":"The Cumbrian Coast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
