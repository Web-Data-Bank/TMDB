It was a magnificent engineering feat, making a smooth path through difficult terrain that was fit for nothing less than steam express trains. The best way of appreciating it is from the drving cab, little changed in over a hundred years.  We join a 2 car Sprinter at Skipton. This fast service takes us through the restored junction station at Hellifield complete with semaphore signalling. We join the famous long drag at Settle Junction - 15 miles of almost continuous climb up to Blea Moor.  The 24 arch Ribblehead viaduct is seen from the air as well as from the driverâ€™s cab. Our sprinter disappears into the long tunnels at Blea Moor and Rise Hill while we fly over the top for a surprising view! The Long Drag is shown almost in real time with Appleby to Carlisle discretely condensed into half an hour. This is as much a Bird's eye view as a Driver's eye view.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pIUYEDIUPToJrS8s642okKVOL2V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Skipton to Carlisle","title":"Settle and Carlisle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
