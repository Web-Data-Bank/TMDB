To save her bankrupt rural family, Xiulan takes the train to Taipei to earn money. Boyfriend Huotu is horrified to find she has been tricked into becoming a dancer in a nightclub when he visits, and tries to persuade her to leave the next morning on the early train from Taipei. Tragedy piles upon tragedy in this cautionary tale, which touched a nerve with audiences and inspired a raft of sequels.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1fyCOt6AW7stQYmLJe82jAtlYqQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tailian Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Early Train From Taipei","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
