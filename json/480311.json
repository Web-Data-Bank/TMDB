In his own time, Harg works on ideas for a revolutionary new manufacturing process for hard steel. When his father is badly injured in a workplace accident resulting from employer negligence, Harg uses some of the compensation payment to develop his invention to a stage where it can be tested in practice. It is a huge success and Harg patents his process. He rises to a position on the board of the company, before staging a coup to oust his former employer and take over the business himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":95984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Langham Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1932-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men of Steel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
