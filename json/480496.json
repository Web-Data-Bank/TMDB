Harassed by this spell, his great-great grandson, also a priest, is forced to flee from the town to the capital and from there to a cathedral submerged in the depths of the ocean. Black magicians, delinquents, insects, archons and even Satan himself will be some of the sinister characters he will have to face in order to succeed in his evangelizing adventure.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/vJQmmWl7gG9jUJ1eg98Wiumhpfj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terranova \u0026 Labrador","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ayudar al ojo humano","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
