The patient died in late 2000 at the age of 81. He left a wife and three children. Poignant conversations with the widow and youngest son, and excerpts from letters from the other two children reveal that a concentration camp syndrome can also inflict deep wounds in those who have not personally experienced it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14604,"logo_path":"/nayCQwYiu9QfYn1IprLuo48d8q5.png","name":"Spectrum Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":96038,"logo_path":null,"name":"Euro-Television Productions","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2003-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Price of Survival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
