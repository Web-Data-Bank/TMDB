The story is a gradually unfolding spiritual crisis, juxtaposed through two central characters: a young child, full of curiosity and wonderment, and a hard-working, 32 year-old butcher struggling to begin his own family life. It ultimately exposes the harsh social difficulties in sustaining a modest, middle-class life within the contemporary American culture of systemic decay.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/64592sIetIR0Wm1kS7SOmw6nEGv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cedars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
