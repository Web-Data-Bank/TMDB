Heloisa blames Ruth for her bad relationship with her own daughter, her failed marriage, and even her unsuccessful career. It’s a conflict that worsens when Ruth, after being diagnosed with cancer, finds out that Heloisa has fallen in love with Leda, a painter she met at the hospital where she works. The new relationship is not well accepted by her family, let alone by Ruth, which worsens the friction between them.","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":"/m5KGfJZqj7NlnOS5F5DfI2M03cU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13573,"logo_path":"/4dqepK1XdLklrsYdnFpCEkOPXLX.png","name":"Canal Brasil","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":58042,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elo Company","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Querida Mamãe","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9}
