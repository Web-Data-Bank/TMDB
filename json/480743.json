The first story is about Jernac that had a fight with Tomas because of Rezika. Another story tells about Tincek, limp foundling, who spent his youth with the Komar family, where he fell in love with their Lencka. The third is the story of a rich Miholac whose attention was grabbed by poor Polonca, a romance that was opposed by his father. The central theme of all stories is love that eventually everybody die of.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/A5j5D9Vf8WZoBKqXTny4VqUTNJY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viba Film","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":33749,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTV Ljubljana","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1987-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Is the Ruin of Us All","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
