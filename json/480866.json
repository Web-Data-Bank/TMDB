The setlist reached back to his first recordings with The Yardbirds in 1966 and came right up to date with tracks from his most recent album “Loud Hailer.” As the evening progressed he was joined by many of the great musicians he has collaborated with over the years including Billy F. Gibbons, Buddy Guy, Jimmy Hall, Jan Hammer, Beth Hart and Steven Tyler. The show climaxed with the guests all joining forces for an exhilarating encore performance of “Purple Rain” in tribute to Prince, who had passed away a couple of months before the concert.","popularity":0.754,"poster_path":"/r62uR5dMAezscUO9O0dkgy6r1hS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeff Beck: Live At The Hollywood Bowl","video":true,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4}
