Shum becomes a courtesan to fulfil Tai-ming's last wish of funding his younger brother Chi-ming's studies in Australia, while creating the false impression that she is a rich widow. Chi-ming returns in summer and a chance encounter in the nightclub evolves into a budding romance. Tormented by a love doomed from the start, Shum pretends to despise the poor suitor. The rejection is taken hard by Chi-ming, who snubs the woman in public. Shum plunges into despair, taking gravely ill. Her lawyer Lee Chung-ling finally breaks the silence, making Chi-ming attuned to the woman's unspoken suffering after she's been laid to rest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":166733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kong Ngee Motion Picture Production Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1965-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ungratefulness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
