German spies have been using a Peace Society as a front for their nefarious activities (the rotters!), but our stout lads are on to them. They finally rout the blackguards while on active service in the Middle East - or at least the English field that stands in for it! The eponymous lads actually include a lass, who joins up as a nurse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Mpg02VR0llQsjXVnm39HZCe3LP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52681,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1919-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lads of the Village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
