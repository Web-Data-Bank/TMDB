After the horrors of the First World War, a sultry madness takes hold of the French society that no authority can stop. The clandestine cinema is commercialized at the back of specialized booksellers and whorehouses for very delighted customers, through short films. Costumed as priests and nuns, ballet dancers, satyrs, sparrow, apes, telegraph operator, in monk or in bellboy, never mind, everything is a pretext to describe love affairs which crudeness and humor have nothing to envy to the contemporary erotic cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iVmJ5s3bgHaqCaDTBQ6mh4cxqgx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vintage Erotica Anno 1920","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
