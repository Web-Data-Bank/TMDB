The seasons change, and so does the music, transforming the mundane into the hypnotic. The love that they sing of is also a metaphor for the need for the other – the friend, the family, the community, to build a polyphony of voices. Stories of love, stories of the field, stories of song, stories in song. Up down and sideways is a musical portrait of a community of rice cultivators and their memories of love and loss, created from working together on the fields.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rIyR4GcXR1r5MlAN6nlN0jaaXsA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Assamese","iso_639_1":"as","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up Down & Sideways","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
