Ελέφαντας","overview":"The title of the film recalls the well known story of the three blind men, who try in vain to recognize and define, by touch, an unknown object - in this case, an elephant. In a triptych of three different stories, told by three inmates of a jail, the story unfolds with sarcasm and irony regarding human actions. The heroes of the film try to tame human passions (erotically instinctive) - but, alas, they do not succeed. A situation comedy in which the nude appears in the plot where least expected.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bRUveJ6ZOewhGcBABg52IoWe5B0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40238,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alpha TV","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":19344,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bad Movies","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/x5m947rMvwJbNpoGil5W76dIJjB.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2000-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Is an Elephant","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
