The story is not unique. Olga (Ivana Chýlková) graduated from college and started a successful career. But at the age of twenty-seven she married a twenty-year-old Vladimir (Alois Švehlík), a man with a much lower education than she . Instead of continuing a career , she stayed at home, taking care of the household and raising three children (at the time of our story, Olga and Vladimir have been living for 15 years). She became a mere maid, from which obedience and 100% household care is expected without any recognition or gratitude.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2005-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oběti: Hadí tanec","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
