Born in 1933, di Suvero has become one of the most recognized sculptors of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. From about 1975 to 1977, fairly early in di Suvero's long career, filmmaker de Menil and art historian Rose produced this film, which was characterized at the time as \"a tribute to the extraordinary work and life of the innovative American sculptor of monumental but delicate constructions.\" The film shows di Suvero making and installing several of his very large sculptures, and incorporates informal interviews of di Suvero, his mother, and others involved in his career and life at that time. From 1971 to 1975 di Suvero, an American, lived in a self-imposed exile in France in protest of US involvement in war in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, and the filming spans the end of his exile and his return to New York.","popularity":0.822,"poster_path":"/1EaxqKt3BFnkFljvszablI000n1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parrot Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North Star: Mark di Suvero","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
