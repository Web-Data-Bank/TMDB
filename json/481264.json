That is why he continuously visits a psychiatrist, why he acts a bit weird. He is a bit of a hermit, bearing, as much as he can, the extreme normalcy of his family, who are dying for summer to arrive so they can go to a time share at the beach, while Tomás wants to escape… to the moon.","popularity":0.965,"poster_path":"/gAEWAFoljaxBlJlGhrHv7l6l8lP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101028,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgen Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":400,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Trip to the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":11}
