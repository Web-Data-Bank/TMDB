The film portrays the interaction between the past and the present, layering images and sounds, creating a collaged experience of Kingsway. Architectural signs and symbols overpower the foreground evoking the automotive scale, but present-day buildings and spaces re ect a changing vernacular as portrayed by the street’s soundscape and the road’s new sense of place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kingsway","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
