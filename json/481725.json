Collaborating to subdivide a 16mm  film frame into thirds, three  lmmakers present their separately-shot segments simultaneously within one spatial plane. From the interplay of these three points of view emerges a cinematic conversation based on a horizontal compositional logic within the shared frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/srnpOIgMRvEeABlUP0anEZDx4fV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tri-Alogue #2","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
