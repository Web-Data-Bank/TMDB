From his prison cell in 1992, the political prisoner Raymond Luc Levasseur writes 'My Blood is Quebecois' in which he explains his rebellion and his radicalization by his status as a 'frog' and the racism he witnessed in a small mill town of Maine where his ancestors came to work in the factories. Released in 2004, he returned to his native Maine where he tells us about his career, from his childhood in a French Canadian family until today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vk8UpQZ5QuU5vv01KzKEMF5MPS6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Tricycle","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An American, Portrait of Raymond Luc Levasseur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
