Krzysztof Warlikowski strips down a tragedy haunted by ghosts, and places the intimate at the heart of an imaginary fresco truer than history itself. Along with Philippe Jordan, he reveals to the public the very first version of this great five-act opera: the version modified by Verdi himself for the work’s first performance in 1867.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/noUvZ0FobGeftkhlY8NbkcnzvsU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":290,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Giuseppe Verdi's grand opera live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on October 19th, 2017","title":"Opéra National de Paris: Verdi's Don Carlos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
