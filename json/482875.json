Or should run away from, since Buster spends all his spare time provoking strangers into fights, then refusing to defend himself as they pummel him 'til they grow bored. He's also a grifter, sucking his brother dry, and a cancer, sabotaging his brother's relationship with his girlfriend. Think of him as the patron saint of passive aggression, the don of all losers, or maybe just a regular guy who lost his mind trying to avoid growing up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nVkgDjcfLZ2aRgN3zcl4gGieGSE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96475,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Sister","origin_country":""},{"id":46600,"logo_path":null,"name":"Governess Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buster","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
