Here he evokes a career spent collecting fragments of other people's lives, and journeys back to the cell where he found himself sharing the fate of the people he writes about. His words, the narrative fabric of the film, turn into action: we follow him first along the Donbass front and then on his return journey, to the place \"where it all began and where it all ended:\" Syria. Because \"it's not about going home; it's about coming back here.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ehKZGwM4u9JPDvftldFd90EHeJK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ombre dal fondo","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
