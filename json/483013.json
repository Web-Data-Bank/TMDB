This battalion is located in Mosul. I have 48 hours to make a decision. I decide to go. There, a friend gives me his old Hi8 camera with ten tapes. I am a photographer. I have never filmed anything. I have never seen war. For a whole month, I remain close to these soldiers and I film their everyday life, in spite of everything. Long waits, times out, endless wanderings through the city, looking for untraceable terrorists.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edouard Beau Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for Hassan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
