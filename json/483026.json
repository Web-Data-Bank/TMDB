Including the usual amount of highly useful exercises for the practicing guitarist (and truly frightening displays of Gilbert's over-the-top technique), it's also loaded with Gilbert's goofy sense of humor, which makes the video a treat to watch even for non-musicians. Gilbert also offers tips on more \"big-picture\" topics like working with managers and producers. Plenty of entertaining live and in-the-studio footage of Gilbert with his band, Mr. Big, are intercut with the lessons as well, making this video a must for Gilbert's fans, be they guitarists or not.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uVzHLqAWc6vIoCxPMydLOAwu0VZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Gilbert: Terrifying Guitar Trip","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
