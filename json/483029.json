In his film, \"The Traitors' Children\", Christian Weisenborn presents harrowing encounters with the children of the executed conspirators, while also taking a look at his own family history. His parents belonged to a group of anti-fascists, which the Gestapo called the \"Rote Kapelle\" (the red chapel). Weisenborn's parents survived, but 52 of their friends were hanged in Plötzensee in 1942/43. Weisenborn also interviewed their sons and daughters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9J8kiVtEFiAIsVggKp2rHgYum6J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74607,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kick Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Traitors' Children - Sons and Daughters of the Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
