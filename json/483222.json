Maintaining this façade in order to save face has become something of a full-time job for him. When Pekka’s parents unexpectedly come for a visit, he throws a lavish family dinner party in order to dispel any doubts. The soirée is a success until Pekka’s god-daughter gets run over by a car. The reckless driver becomes a mutual enemy for the family. The driver tries to atone for his actions, but the situation spirals out of control and Pekka attacks the man. Pekka realizes things have gone too far and decides to tell his family the truth. It does not hurt as much as Pekka thought, bringing the pieces of a once broken family back together.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":"/swKUgfpet2OltMrELyMoVBQt3WE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79811,"logo_path":"/jSzhkuSGhdQtKulhYDGNS4Ig01E.png","name":"Bufo","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":61143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smile Entertainment","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2018-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Human Part","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":8}
