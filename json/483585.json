Eight great rock guitarists gathered together on one stage in a celebration of inspired guitar driven rock music. This is a feast of guitar magic as eight, very different guitarists compete, collaborate and celebrate their craft.  World famous names like Robin Trower, Jan Akkerman and Ronnie Montrose are joined by Laurie Wisefield (Wishbone Ash), Rick Derringer and Ian Crichton (SAGA). The older heads provide the inspiration and impetus for two new and emerging talents Dave Sharman and Danny Darekovic. The result is a powerful portrait of how to combine virtuosity, great music and fun in one exciting package.
