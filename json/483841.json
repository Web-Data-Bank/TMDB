Still in the prime of life, her beauty is overlooked even by her husband Sandro, who runs the local car repair shop. Things change when Megi, the comely star of a film being shot nearby, happens upon the scene to get her car repaired. Lia knows a rival when she sees one - although she's also aware she doesn't stand a chance against a mini-skirt. Megi, however, has a few tricks up her sleeve too - she knows what a Cinderella needs to rid herself of the pumpkin.","popularity":0.762,"poster_path":"/xwP33LxEQIiZ1rYMxhxnACVlThf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regina Ziegler Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"1999-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Georgian Grapes","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":4}
