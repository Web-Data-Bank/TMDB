Young students learn about the amazing journey of sound -- from the source that creates the sound to the mechanics of the ear that enable it to be heard. Children discover why sound needs a 'medium' to travel, why there is no sound in space and how certain animals are able to 'see' by using sound! A fun, hands-on activity and clearly illustrated diagrams help students learn these basic concepts. One of 11 volumes in the Physical Science for Children DVD Series in the Schlessinger Science Library. Part of the Schlessinger Science Library for Children Collection. This title correlates to the National Science Education Standards for Physical Science -- properties of objects & materials, position & motion of objects and light, heat, electricity & magnetism. A Teacher's Guide is included and available online.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schlessinger Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Physical Science For Children - All About Sound","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
