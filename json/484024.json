Next, Elmo's fantasies take him to France during WW1 where he defeats the Black Baron in a thrilling sky duel. Both men live to share the insatiable ladies of the Chateau. The Blonde Goddess appears, as she does at the climax of each fantasy, luring him to place of endless lust.  Jack Hammer, Private Eye, is Elmo's next reverie.
