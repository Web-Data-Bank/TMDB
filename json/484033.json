A ‘Plas Newydd’ drama with a (tenous) 007 connection - it was scripted by travel writer Peter Fleming, brother of James Bond creator Ian Fleming! A detective posing as a footman infiltrates the ‘Pink Shirts’ (satirising Britain’s Blackshirts) and plots their downfall. They must have had a ball, the family, friends and staff of the 6th Marquis of Anglesey, pretending to be fascists (waders came in useful here) or defenders of democracy armed with a catapult and drawing pins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1936-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Shirts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
