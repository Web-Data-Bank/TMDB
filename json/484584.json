Despite what you may believe, one thing is certain - when it comes to the no bullshit, get-it-done training style of owner / head coach Danny 'Cage', you can't fake the blood, sweat, tears, and focus it takes to make dreams come true.","popularity":0.884,"poster_path":"/wuFwF1caerN3MzexNSjIrd9bQqq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96839,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Big Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monster Factory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
