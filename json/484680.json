Printed in varying colors and thicknesses ranging from 1 filament layer (.2mm) to 3 filament layers (.6mm), the resulting 1-second strips of film were threaded through a JK optical printer and photographed digitally to produce video output. Still left to do: splice them together and run them through a 16mm projector! And possibly make some attempt at printing animations or patterns into the face of the film, other than the standard MakerBot crosshatch.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"filament studies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
