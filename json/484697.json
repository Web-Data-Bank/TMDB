She already tried twice. The first time she was stopped with fake documents in the airport in Nigeria, by immigration authorities. This made her decide to begin a deadly journey through the Sahara desert hoping to embark on a migration boat bound for Italy. The film is about migration, sex work and human trafficking seen from the perspective of Becky.
