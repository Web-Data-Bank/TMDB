Missing in action for many years, this raucous comedy of army life, which looks back on the latter days of WWII, is a slam-bang showcase for the boisterous variety antics of comedian Hal Monty, seen here in his heyday performing rough and ready slapstick sketches aplenty. Heâ€™s accompanied by regular foil Les Ritchie, as his uptight sergeant, and comical crooner Max Bygraves, in his screen debut.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dJOtDbZSVSrL8f6ue4xH6p4Tcit.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1949-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bless 'em all","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
