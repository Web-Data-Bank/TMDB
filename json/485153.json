It’s an amazing tale of immigrant outsiders who became irreplaceable players in pop culture’s mainstream – a generation of songwriters who found in Christmas the perfect holiday in which to imagine a better world, and for at least one day a year, make us believe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5DvdautM38LKHkoEgsrh3Xvu369.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Riddle Films Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreaming of a Jewish Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
