Maggie escapes her loneliness and the chaos of her family by entering the strangely beautiful world she discovers through the viewfinder of her snap-n-shoot camera. Yet, unable to trust that what she sees is worth capturing, she never takes a picture. When the family makes a pit stop in the middle of nowhere, Maggie's feelings of being invisible are intensified after she is accidentally left behind. There at the gas station she meets June, the desert-worn, reclusive proprietor who proves more than just a passing influence on this little girl's journey to find her own voice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iyF648gSZZ6GpJu09GNhZGcYvMJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Inspiration Lives in the Most Unlikely Places","title":"Pitstop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
