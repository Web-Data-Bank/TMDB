Their parents are gone so they live in the countryside with their uncle, “Es Conco”, who takes care of them while he cultivates the farm in the raw nature. The kids play around learning all about the island in a kind of a magic mode- not only by the things you see but by the stories related to them and all the legends that grow around in the stunning environment. The past, the present and the future meet in one place where tales and real facts intermingle. One day, the children discover a ship on the bay, which is like an icon of a human wish- present while unattainable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lE46L0ILBk8W9mVh8pWCkTol10n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La vida lliure","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":6}
