The only two things he has ever been passionate about are his inventions and his autograph collection. He has only one friend, Vance Marlow. One day, while Mitchell is working in his basement, Vance shows up, claiming that he has invented a device, out of a label maker, that can let him travel in time. Vance convinces Mitchell into coming along with him, as they set out on a hilarious and eye opening quest to get the autographs of the four Gospel writers, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Along the way they learn a few things about what is REALLY important in life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/19aEETkyzukDG1TrENSHVU0Mc18.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96978,"logo_path":null,"name":"TPTFILMS Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":96601,"logo_path":"/tnKR9K9ZgOVGdi4UBPqFRMuWuoI.png","name":"Rossetti Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What is REALLY important in life?","title":"The Gospel Writers' Autographs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
