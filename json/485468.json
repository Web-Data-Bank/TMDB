The family, who to all appearances are totally \"normal\", make Julien's nutrition and well-being their highest priority. But then Julien falls in love with Keiko, a young Japanese girl. In order to seduce her he pretends to be a Sumo-champion but soon finds himself in a quandary: he needs to lose weight for his new family, but he needs to gain weight if he is going to take part in the Sumo training and seduce Keiko. Bit by bit Julien's lies start to crumble and it becomes very apparent that the other protagonists' notion of normality is very relative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cyYmi0HSstbdxvBgJ1H5rulps0M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sauvons les apparences!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
