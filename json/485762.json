Using various methods of \"painting over\" or projecting on top of Giorgione's \"Sleeping Venus,\" Boettcher alienates the work artistically. Venus' beauty is seen within a new context and is thereby newly interpreted through the eyes of STRAWALDE. The assorted landscapes behind Venus range from idyllic pastorales to morbid backgrounds. STRAWALDE's art knows no boundaries and makes a strong impression on the viewer with bizarre sound collages.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tHf1O99Q4odH0Y4pHGbqLkVq1Qc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venus nach Giorgione","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
