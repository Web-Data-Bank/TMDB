Paulus Potter's simple postcard scene entitled \"The Young Bull\" (\"den jungen Stier\") is artistically alienated in an imposing fashion. By using assorted means of \"painting over\" and/or front projections, the figure of the bull in the center of the card is placed in a state of constant flux. A viewer may also choose to follow the shifting background behind the bull, which continues to recontextualize the bull in shifting worlds. Accompanied by a sound collage.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":"/tHf1O99Q4odH0Y4pHGbqLkVq1Qc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Potters Stier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
