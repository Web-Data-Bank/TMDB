Cuccia had a ticket to the concert but never made it.  Thirty years later, collaborating with Zappa's family, he re-creates the events through a combination of rare concert and backstage footage; photographs; anecdotes from family, band members, and concertgoers; and insights from Zappa biographer and friend Massimo Bassoli. The story is also a personal one, as Cuccia interweaves the story of Zappa's trip to Sicily with his own memories from that summer.","popularity":1.116,"poster_path":"/fFfo6auriMqnWydURok2g2auvAc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frank Zappa - Summer '82: When Zappa Came to Sicily","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":5}
