He drives around in a car that's one big ad for himself and occasionally makes the local news with some freak incident. When the film starts he has just burned down his trailer and caused a traffic jam. He then hits the road with a DV cam to capture real life. A friend promised him he could sell such material to an Italian TV station. When he meets a famous singer on the way and gets drawn into her story things get interesting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Promised Land","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
