He makes off with only one, whom he drops about a mile away. A pig rescues this baby, so one brother grows up high on the hog, the other down with the swine; one is lazy, his lost brother is industrious. Years later, when a neighboring prince declares war, the brother in the castle is too soft to fight. Through happenstance, the twins are united just before the final battle. Will the upper-class brother let his humble sibling lead the troops to certain defeat and death?","popularity":0.685,"poster_path":"/zTg7yHiTmiA4aPkKdrd6jeIEJSP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":297,"logo_path":"/58TnhYZqbMYgkHM6lg7dJoYJ4RH.png","name":"Aardman","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wat's Pig","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":11}
