Relationships for them are chat with virtual girls they have never seen, living a fake fashion show in which they pretend something that is not the biggest life problem, then a discharged cell phone or a broken wifi. The pressure of parents is forced to go under the leadership of David's charming \"stepmother\" Tereza on a twenty-kilometer bicycle trip, surprisingly finding out there is a real world out there in which life means more than facebook status, real girls look a little better than cartoon action heroes of virtual games and love also include sex.","popularity":0.772,"poster_path":"/pAS3l8qIzI6mKFfM7dQArLHwhFk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vinná galerie","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bikers","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":11}
