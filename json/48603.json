In search of some happiness, Martin takes off to the coastal town of Mar de Plata, where his older brother lives. Unglamorous, yet enchantingly addictive and refreshingly genuine, Acuña paints a confused and uncomfortable world, and makes us want revisit it over and over again.","popularity":0.687,"poster_path":"/wTYslVk0T2QjlhiNlS7970p3WJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9962,"logo_path":null,"name":"BD Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2003-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swim Alone","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
