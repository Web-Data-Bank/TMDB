These men and women, that back then were children, found a legendary Jewish-German character named Fredy Hirsch, who changed their lives forever. The work describes the terrible living conditions in Terezin Ghetto and; on the other hand, the approach to culture and art behind the walls of the concentration camp. Up to this moment, everything develops as a known story, but by the end of 1943 there is an unexpected turn when these children are deported together with their families to the extermination camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau. And there, in the middle of hell, they lived in.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qQLLIUZCc2fLQ4rW2ueFtDcsmO1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Momentum Films","origin_country":""},{"id":97111,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cohen y Cohen Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven in Auschwitz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
