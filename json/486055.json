Criminals, mafiosi, authors of numerous murders accompany us on an unimaginable journey: a journey into dark souls, a journey into deep darkness through lightning shots like lightning blinding those looking at them. A political documentary which places the perspective, the sense of punishment, and his atonement through the voice of the sentenced and the prison administration. Men with a binge eating habit, a \"never-ending punishment\" that today is a manifestation of the institutions and who unquestionably thank those who have taken them out of their \"free\" lost lives. Prison policemen emerge as conscious heroes and guardians of our consciences: human and mature, state protectors. A journey into our black soul, an opaque mirror and fringed scum. The keywords that accompany you on this journey are: guilt, atonement, and hope. Hope against every hope, even where there is no reason to exist.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/u2mUjSIu6bzND1fqilMUm8rxt0m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spes contra Spem: Free Inside","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
