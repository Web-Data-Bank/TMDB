Mouris says, “I shot another 100 foot roll on classmate Jerry Strawbridge’s home animation stand, and edited that into the best sequences from QUICK DREAM. The whole film was a tongue-in-cheek series of odd couples/couplings, which the title suggested. The FRANK FILM photo collage animation evolved here.” - Yale","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zkOtKfQFNLymIW1NkiYlFkpekzQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You're Not Real Pretty but You're Mine...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
