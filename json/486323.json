Their death only fostered the belief of many Americans that the Rosenbergs were innocent, victims of the anti-Communist paranoia of the 50s, rather than spies who had stolen atomic secrets for the Russians. In this landmark documentary, Alvin Goldstein looks at the facts and procedures of the Rosenberg case, as well as the climate of the times, interviewing jurors, FBI agents, lawyers for both sides, and the two sons of the Rosenbergs. Using documentary and newsreel footage, Goldstein creates a moving human drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5wBDPAROik6Fuic81X19LwNp3tx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Facets Multimedia Distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unquiet Death of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
