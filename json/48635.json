That's the all-important question behind this broad comedy from Spain. Isi (Santiago Segura) and Disi (Florentino Fernandez) are two best friends who live in a lower middle-class neighborhood near Madrid. Isi and Disi aren't especially bright, but their devotion to heavy metal is complete and unquestioned, and they wouldn't be caught dead listening to a lame pop singer like, say , Joaquin Sabina. However, one day Isi sees Vane (Jaydy Michel), a beautiful girl who attends a nearby college, and immediately falls head over heels in love.","popularity":3.094,"poster_path":"/bn8JLZHxuHdwpjWdpXl1yld8TBG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intuition Films","origin_country":""},{"id":1025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lolafilms","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2004-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isi/Disi - Amor a lo bestia","video":false,"vote_average":4.904,"vote_count":52}
