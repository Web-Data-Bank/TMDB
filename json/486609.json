The predictable and unpredictable, the calculated race of the star and the incalculable (or almost) clouds, the routine and the event, the story and the anecdote - all punctuated by 7 visions. Filmed from a constant geolocated point, to an open window overlooking a French city where a canal and a few planes pass. It's also a family film that would make the reamake of Rear Window:take the measure of the small world, exterior and interior where we live, measure, to take a small place, its place, tell stories, have visions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ps7f7TxWxTn6Ozu3tyyRgArilm5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venus: 99 nights, 2 mornings, 7 visions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
