During the days and nights of winter, Max and his companions split their time between farming activities, skiing, and the pub. Everything is muffled, by the snow and the silence. Up until singing cuts this silence and reunites the community. This is a film that is fascinated by the forms of the landscape and the presence of men, but also by an ambiance that opens the imagination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2mo4jFgtsvYbrN4dtrKjxCfnxZG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Médiadiffusion - Atelier de Production de l'IAD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sound of Winter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
