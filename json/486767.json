Despite of all the protesting voices breaking into the apartment, coming from street protests about which no one knew, Josh and Johan could smell the danger from way closer.

The latest film by Noel Alejandro is an ode to sex between men who share a home, in all its complicated glory: unexpected, unsettled, and extremely hot.","popularity":0.96,"poster_path":"/bCyMTfsZRIOF8reDnA4jKELEcfq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noel Alejandro Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roomies","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3}
