Mauritius, an important stopover in the eastern slave trade, also came to be known as the “Maroon republic” because of the large number of escaped slaves. This film is a testament to the powers of globalisation and the impact of colonial rule, where a more complex layering of cultural takeovers and integrations have occurred and remain visible today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Île de France","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
