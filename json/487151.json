Hall: Mostly Kid Stuff","overview":"Simply put, Warren B Hall is not what you're expecting... he purposely avoids using the white vs black angle done by many mainstream comedians. Daring to be different Warren chooses to focus on funny!     Warren has been seen on the shows “Laughs” as well as “Comics Unleashed\"  and he can be heard regularly on Pandora, Spotify and Sirius XM radio.     Warren has gone overseas and performed for our troops stationed in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan..not once or twice but FIVE times. His style is original, relatable and definitely funny!     Don't take our word for it, see some of the funny for yourself!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warren B.
