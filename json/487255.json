His first films made specifically for theatrical release, and his first for a major studio, the “Black Society Trilogy” was the beginning of Mike’s mature career as a filmmaker and they remain among the prolific director’s finest works.  Here he sits down to talk about his career.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ph9wfQjGAvvbIWJNKukibgKhqka.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Takashi Miike: Into the Black","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
