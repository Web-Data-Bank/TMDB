It provides an examination into the modern cocktail renaissance, and allows you to experience it all through the lens of one bartender’s road trip. The trip itself takes viewers behind the scenes on a trek across the western U.S., from a speakeasy in Denver to a dive bar in Tucson to an elegant hotel bar in Santa Fe. In addition, the film highlights the perspectives of those benefiting by the cocktail’s recent boom—local farmers, small distillers, eager customers—but most importantly it showcases the one who puts it all the together; the bartender. This is a film, which tells a story that is every bit as intoxicating as the beverages it describes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p87RRiZ487ay6zlIw9WTc1mllA7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bartender At Large","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
