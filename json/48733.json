Once in the courtroom, they are horror-stricken as the young, hard-pressed district attorney seems unable to overcome the technicalities and maneuverings that the driver's attorney uses to keep his client out of jail and still on the streets as a legal driver. When the judge is forced to rule time and again in favor of the defense, it appears that the driver might escape punishment altogether.","popularity":3.834,"poster_path":"/5eozuhLqxqCp9U2tZTu9hICNELN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12677,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marian Rees Associates","origin_country":""},{"id":95714,"logo_path":null,"name":"D.
