It is the fourth part in a series of North American landscape films that I have been shooting since 2003. It essentially deals with the notion of \"the old west,\" \"the frontier,\" the blurred line between historical fact and myth, the role of Hollywood in the historical process, the importance of celebrity in America, and finally the influence that the western landscape has had in defining the mythology of \"the old west.\"  Jason Britski","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Oi7BJMzbOWiNMuMPgJI1b2mrKR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Horse Point","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
