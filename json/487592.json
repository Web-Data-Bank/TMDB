The program argues that because of the island's key location - sandwiched, as it is, in-between Southern Europe and Northern Africa - it inevitably impeded Axis and Allied reinforcement deliveries time and again. As a result, the Maltese people found themselves caught in the middle of a crossfire when they had virtually nothing to do with the war itself, and suffered immensely for their geographic placement. In telling this seldom-heard story, the program draws on first-person interviews, CGI animations, and dramatic recreations.","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":"/cbIkKUi0Omr42DwFt3boTW9oIHX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imaginites","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2007-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Against All Odds: The Quest For Malta","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
