Even the minister, who performed their marriage ceremony, making a pastoral call annoys him. They attend a social gathering, and his ill-concealed perturbation at his young wife's affability with all present spoils her evening's pleasure, and finally induces her to ask to be taken home. Arriving home, a stormy scene ensues, and there might have been a separation but for the wife's subtleness in placing within his range delicate reminders of her own gentleness.","popularity":0.665,"poster_path":"/kuPnbACtSISmKUuITEbU8Z5b5EB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope \u0026 Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Victim of Jealousy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
