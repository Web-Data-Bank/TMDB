An unseen narrator guides us through the story, describing how he unearthed a pile of letters and fragments of a novel in an abandoned trailer in the countryside. Slowly, these fragments come to life, revealing how the writer's paranoid fantasies provoke a psychological meltdown.Exploring a number of contemporary concerns - the media, modern art, digitalisation, modernism, ecology - the film experiments with filmic genres and uses image and sound to mirror the writer's descent into madness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
