When he finds out that up-andcoming indie director Matsunaga Daishi is holding auditions for his latest film, Matsumoto pulls out all the stops to get in. Director Ninomiya Ken began this project as a Borat-esque mockumentary about the desperate measures aspiring actors take to break into show business. But when Fighter and his manager push the limits of their unsuspecting prey a little too far, fiction and reality begin to overlap in disturbing and surprisingly violent ways. Will Fighter finally get his big break, or will his dreams come crumbling down?","popularity":0.628,"poster_path":"/43FWXqsl7NTw7tW2vWXTPSd5vSN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ashtray Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beyond the truth...","title":"Matsumoto Tribe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
