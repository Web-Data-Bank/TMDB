Where the pavement turned to gravel, in a small, primitive cinder block building, bands like Fugazi, the Melvins, Rollins Band, Gwar, the Circle Jerks, Body Count, Social Distortion, Bad Brains, White Zombie, Descendents, Sonic Youth, Green Day, Fishbone, the Meat Puppets, Helmet, and Nirvana played to all-ages crowds, a raucous scene of misfits and anarchists on the margins of youth culture. This was The Outhouse. Small, dark and sometimes dangerous, it quickly gained a reputation as a haven for the bands other venues were afraid of, and the kids who loved them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gfXnb9jv39f9qAuEaBzQi2gIS4t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Outhouse The Film 1985-1997","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
