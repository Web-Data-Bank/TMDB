He is a doctor who has just been called up we learn eventually. This is the end of the line- the Germans are about to retreat. He goes to a hospital which is being evacuated and is thrown out. Kicked out he wanders with another conscript- a failed actor turned postman. The postman is deafened by a shell explosion. They meet their Russian equivalents, others as bad at killing as they are, while other Russians and Germans kill one another around them.","popularity":1.089,"poster_path":"/dc4M0uMiViQ0iN8npn7rniN9Cdn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75158,"logo_path":null,"name":"PIEF Film Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":5630,"logo_path":"/s0mHCw53fp6EAapR7g0dwYbz0l5.png","name":"Non-Stop Productions","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2004-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Train","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":8}
