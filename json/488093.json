All around him, he sees innocent civilians getting injured by landmines, so he determines to disarm them with his own hands, using just a pocketknife and some wire cutters. He clears thousands of roadside bombs, mines and car bombs, knowing that every time he cuts a wire it could cost him his life—which he seems to find less important than the lives of others. In 2014, by this time having lost a leg, he starts working for the Kurdish Peshmerga, disarming boobytraps left behind by Daesh in and around Mosul. An enthusiastic home video maker, Fakhir collects hundreds of hours of footage of his day-to-day work.","popularity":0.682,"poster_path":"/375izpJGS9NFYvJtTebD7VBZOwk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ginestra Film","origin_country":""},{"id":92691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lolav Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2018-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deminer","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":7}
