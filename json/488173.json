It is a fiction, set to melody and percussion, which is narrated by a ‘chorus’ of museum administrators who are organising the records of Arthur Evans’s excavation of the Cretan city of Knossos. The administrators use Evans’s extraordinary documents and photographs to figuratively reconstruct the Knossos Labyrinth within the museum’s computer server. They then imagine its involuted space as a virtual chamber through which museum objects digitally flow, clatter and cascade.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/6uYIAeSF7kWXFaLQISDFFhVWuU3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Restoration","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
