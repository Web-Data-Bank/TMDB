Dan has just recovered from a scorching New York Times review, which forced his last show out of theaters prematurely. Now he faces a wider backlash against puppetry, suggesting an eerie parallel between himself and his new puppet-subject - a portrait photographer whose stunning body of work was very nearly lost forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How much can we feel for a block of wood?","title":"Puppet","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
