They form a circle, are of different nationalities and live in the big metropolises of the world. They are beautiful--a famous painter, a fashion model, a song star. When their profession forces them to move to a city where one of the couples of the circle lives, they share not only their apartment, but also one or the other spouse, as the case may be. Every year, it's a ritual, they all meet for a two-to-three week holiday with one of the couples. This year, they meet in Quebec, in a villa in the Laurentians, near a lake, far from civilization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w4M0lhqMgTmK6v0XXUzUlVT8Wc6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heads or Tails","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
