But Damián knows better: the night visits to the cemetery and the bathroom decorated with plaques; the knives on the wall and the frequent wounds; the bandages and the barbed wire... He also knows that Erica's arrival to get a picture and become famous for it was for the worst: now Leti wants to be sliced until there's no more Leti left to cut.
