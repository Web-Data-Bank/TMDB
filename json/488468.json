Assaulted and trapped with no one to hear her cries for help... and knowing no one will believe her if they do. This is the terrifying reality Alaina finds herself in when she moves in to the house her mother died in. At first she thinks it's the loss of her mother that is haunting her, but she is soon shown it is something far more malicious and unrelenting. The spirit taunts her as it invades her body, mind, and soul, completely trapping her. Alaina has to fight for answers on what really happened to her mother if she has any hopes of survival. She must find a way to endure this monster who lives and breathes to rob her of her sanity as it demands a savage hold on her.","popularity":1.109,"poster_path":"/jwhUKw7NjkyEOHwNJrK9iRu3PGE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sixgun Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Within These Walls","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
