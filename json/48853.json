Suddenly, a cannonball comes flying through the air and knocks the main wall of the prison down. Excited to have a chance to see the change taking place in person, Cainazzo hits a bumpy road when one of his former fellow prisoners yells out to all the revolutionary gangs that Cainazzo is not a patriot, but is in fact a traitor!","popularity":2.143,"poster_path":"/rhsFbVE9w2vPOv5Rnn4KADsdaFl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seda Spettacoli","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1973-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Five Days","video":false,"vote_average":5.889,"vote_count":27}
