The decision to leave their country was driven by the urgent objective of financially supporting their families, but the stay in Buenos Aires crossed them with new people, new ways of seeing things, and even an economic situation different from that which they found at home. Their different ways of seeing things allow them to see in each other a different version of themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v5qSDCEmsJZSixbARK05TpmvgoG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117575,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cais Cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":117576,"logo_path":null,"name":"NELO CINE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
