The film presents one firing of Vancouver's famous gun; an event that attracts an audience visible on screen unlike the audience watching the film; ourselves. Our experience of time in our innermost self is unlike our experience of space or mass yet nothing in physics corresponds to the passage of time.

Norfolk, Virginia also has a Nine O'clock Gun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/usztd0EexJZdbMMGtjcRorqmQZv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nine O’Clock Gun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
