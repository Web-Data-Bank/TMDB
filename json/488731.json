Bringing together a number of collectively shared experiences, Damaged presents a series of significant events — some pleasant, others less so — evincing the complexity of the stages of life and offering models of childhood, sexuality and adulthood that denounce the transmission and acculturation of stigmatized identities.  —Karl-Gilbert Murray, FIFA Catalogue","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bCdT0KZUvPbq2NvPniitVAnyiuZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Damaged","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
