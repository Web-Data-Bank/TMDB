It turns out that this research involves investigating the sex lives of her hosts and their friends. Disappointed with what she discovers, she takes a hand to improve them, taking the husband to visit prostitutes (one of these is Samantha) and making a loan of her boyfriend to the wife. Her 'students' get very enthusiastic - the husband has sex with his secretary (Gwenda Farnel) and the wife seduces her husband's employee. It ends with a wife-swapping foursome with Richard Lemieuvre and Jenny Feeling whose offer of such a party had been turned down at the start of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bH6kb8JTF5xG5p15umSrNpxUYWl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
