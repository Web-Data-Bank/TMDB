To the Beach explores this feeling from three vantage points, filmed (respectively) near, in, and under the sea using a variety of techniques, and registers the resulting images onto hand-made film emulsion. I. Approaching the Shore: in which the ocean first offers its irresistible salty scent. II. Swimming: in which we become again what we are. III. Seeing Stars: as above, so below.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gJ8RsuRPqAsMbyWKHkqTNrj1riI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To the Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
