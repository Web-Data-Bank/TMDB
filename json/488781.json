Bullied into getting roommates by a suspicious inheritance lawyer, she's joined by Hazel (a gutter punk goblin-in-exile) and Half-Off (a naive alien researching human love) on the path to redemption. Monster Girls takes a darkly comic look at the lives of every modern 20-something; desperate to find identity, acceptance, and a way to resist the urge to kill everyone they meet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/buZrykehraP1h4EHjtNOrdvWrfb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97740,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Working Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monster Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
