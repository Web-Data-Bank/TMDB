Unfortunately, influences, such as Cultural Marxism and Corporate Fascism, have perverted the Democratic and Republican parties so much, the Founders' original intent has been seriously compromised. As a result, the republic guaranteed by the Constitution has wandered down a road towards insolvency, immorality and totalitarianism. ORIGINAL INTEN explores how this has happened and offers solutions that Americans, no matter what party affiliation, can apply to restore a nation of values, general welfare, and leadership-by-example.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":195,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How the Democratic and Republican parties are destroying the american dream","title":"Original Intent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
