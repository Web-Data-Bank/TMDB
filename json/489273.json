The film brings forward a reality that the masses usually don't get to know: the men and women moved by a deep passion for acting and touching people. With Julio Adrião, Matheus Nachtergaele, José Celso Martinez, Cássia Kis, Nanda Costa, Babu Santana, Luciano Vidigal and Letícia Sabatella, among others.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/vAHjv4PRfCTxk3LKkZkBaoNyn5q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asteroide","origin_country":""},{"id":97831,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bond's Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":13573,"logo_path":"/4dqepK1XdLklrsYdnFpCEkOPXLX.png","name":"Canal Brasil","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Do You See Me?","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
