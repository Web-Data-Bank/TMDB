While the small-town cops scramble to protect the townsfolk, the killings seem to center around one young woman who may be the final victim on Santa's list. As the slaughter continues and the bodies pile up, it seems that nothing and no one may be able to stop the murderers before they complete their own deadly take on the twelve days of Christmas.","popularity":2.871,"poster_path":"/xoTbJcyGyBrAtlwoCEFtgo2MnEk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102447,"logo_path":"/vjkjMeAdH8PQtlgX5Xc2tbeiECN.png","name":"Alpha Hollywood Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon a Time at Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":18}
