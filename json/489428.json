Just ask him. Sure, he picked up a \"skin thing\" on his vacay in The Caribbean, and he's hungering for brains, but who isn't? Anyway, things are bound to get better when Ted inherits his grandpa's fortune; all he's gotta do is wait for the old man to die. In the meantime, in case things weren't strange enough, Ted follows a hot vampire into group therapy where the patients all suffer disorders of the paranormal. Yep. Things just went from weird to wacky.","popularity":3.424,"poster_path":"/jIcGtk0MOCxr6p1JhpiHb4jejX5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lunatic Fringe Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":97867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zombie Ted","origin_country":""},{"id":97868,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coffee Down Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not All Zombies Are Monsters","title":"An Accidental Zombie (Named Ted)","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":8}
