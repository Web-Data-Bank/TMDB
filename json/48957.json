One shallow grave stands between them and freedom. They had no idea what they were about to get into. In Rabbit Hash, when the sun goes down, the temperature rises. Deep inside this forest, the last remnants of the 1970's - a disco called \"The Funk Haven\" - languishes. It is the last refuge for the polyester-clad lounge lizards of the bygone decade.","popularity":1.37,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Disco is undead","title":"Avenging Disco Vampires","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
