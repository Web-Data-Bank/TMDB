The king is good-natured and doesn't suspect that the queen is plainly beginning to think too much of one of the courtiers. The queen's sister is aware of the situation and saves the queen by taking her place. This deceives the king, but he requires that the villain and the queen's sister be married which complicates the situation as the sister is in love with another courtier entirely.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tFVVwcyjRhkiq30VqoSDZOkJACr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Moving Pictures Co. of America (IMP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For the Queen's Honor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
