Jack Levine got his professional start during the Federal Art Projects of the WPA, and quickly became world famous for his brilliantly painted, brutally ironic vision of America and the world. He is the only American artist who never stopped painting as a Social Realist, even when it went out of vogue in the 1950's and 1960's. \"I'm alone at the old stand. . . I feel I still have something to say. . . Let the avant garde go hang-the human condition is what interests me.\" A self-imposed 'outsider', Levine has deliberately cut himself off from the mainstream: \"I'm like the little dog at the circus who runs the wrong way under the hoop.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This peach of a collaboration between subject and Sutherland displays both their geniuses.","title":"Jack Levine: Feast of Pure Reason","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
