The film follows the visitors, observes the observers, listens to the speakers and descends to the storerooms, labs and conference rooms.  The American museum director, the singing security guard, the Jerusalemite curator, the Haredi kashrut inspector, the Palestinian guide and the visitor who lost her vision are some of the characters that take part in a chain of activities which add up to the museum. For about 18 months director Ran Tal collected footage of the daily routine of the museum that seeks to both reflect and mold the Israeli legacy and culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/glhP0qtJXGjPkjsnkD3kmoxDDp2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15,"logo_path":"/2GukAxjXAF3Qf4GosI6WzIgljL3.png","name":"Lama Films","origin_country":"PS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2017-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Museum","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
