As part of the filmmaking process, he's been given a camera to document his world. The footage he gets is urgent, because there's a war against squeegee kids. This documentary is from the point of view of the kids themselves, in order to provide alternative voices. Roach's camera is positioned behind \"enemy\" lines: living in derelict buildings, squeegeeing for money, being hunted by police.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tCzYtVY1ASgKVOst9pJl54BmaG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S.P.I.T.: Squeegee Punk In Traffic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
