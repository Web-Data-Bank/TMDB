Opposing himself to the current nature films that tend to highly compress time in order to end up with a concentrated sequence of action-elements Kristersson leaves rhythm and tempo almost completely up to the magpies themselves. With great integrity he filmed the daily, social and emotional life of a species of birds that has many points of contact with human life. Thus, the movie offers us the oppurtunity to view our own everyday existence through other eyes, from a world right above our heads, but yet so far away.","popularity":0.697,"poster_path":"/acwkY9FMGWPSwSziiuY36ryEPY2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98114,"logo_path":null,"name":"picafilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1987-03-14","revenue":13487,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pica Pica","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
