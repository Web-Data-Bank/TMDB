In an experimental documentary he portrays the working class outcast Bruno S., who prowls the city as a street musician, performing his own songs. The film unfolds Bruno’s story: abandoned by his mother as a child, he was maltreated in correctional institutions in Nazi Germany. On release after WWII he found work but started performing at the same time as a self-taught musician and poet. Although incapable of “normal” human bonding, he was still able to rejoice in life. When Werner Herzog saw this film he recognized Bruno’s potential and hired him to play starring roles in The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (1974), Heart of Glass (1976) and Stroszek (1977).","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/kxriSQxIl9oNf0UqLtCV8doDbEi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1971-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruno the Black - One Day a Hunter Blew His Horn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
