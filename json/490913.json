Using artists personal experiences as a lens, we'll look at sexuality's influence on music and the role of social media in helping artists complicate mainstream expectations of identity. How far are artists willing to push their music, messages and imagery to challenge the way pop culture defines notions of sexuality, masculinity, femininity, gender and what it means to be queer?","popularity":0.92,"poster_path":"/1lfXRORdKeV9mg0qhthND4jk3IX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sound It Out: The Untitled LGBTQIA Music Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
