This time the show concluded with an extended holiday-themed segment featuring Bing and his guests, Mary Martin , Andre Previn and The United Nations Children’s Choir .  Bing delivers a standout version of “ The Little Drummer Boy ” and performs “ White Christmas ” with Mary Martin.  The other musical selections are dominated by two extended Crosby-Martin medleys, but there’s also a fine solo by Bing on “ I Left My Heart in San Francisco ” and the positively surreal production number, “ Doin’ the Bing ”. (A dance craze was not started.) This would be the last Crosby holiday show not devoted entirely to the Christmas theme.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nWPljj0s18p1IHKntwAD0SaAD3u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bing Crosby Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bing Crosby Show","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
