The very rich oil deposits of the region aroused the covetousness of Hitler who needed the oil from Baku to carry out his program of world domination. His entire campaign of 1942-1943 was aimed at seizing them. But the Soviets and the Allies were determined to prevent him from doing so, by all means, including the most radical, even if it meant wiping the city off the map.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":"/lPvgEthvj6Q3du8PzjgfRsUv708.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baku Media Center","origin_country":""},{"id":24678,"logo_path":"/2XgHpNJsBm6jh4CVrgqpLQemXmU.png","name":"CC\u0026C – Clarke Costelle et Cie","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How the fight to control strategic oil reserves shaped WWII","title":"Hitler's War on Oil: Objective Baku","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
