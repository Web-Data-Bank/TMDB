The film combines elements of horizontal and vertical montage in the soundtrack, using white noise, and radio static as a fragmentation device. The visually striking black and white photography weaves lyrical, pastoral nature with the de- and re- construction of civilization. No. 5 Reversal ends with a filmic signature, an image of its maker framed in front of a window against a backdrop of ruins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lCebR8H6guy5wIeN8jxT8qEeBaR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No. 5 Reversal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
