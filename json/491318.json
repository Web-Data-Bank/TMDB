We wanted to find out. And so we did all that. Then we made Depth Perception.  The film invites you to join Austen Sweetin, Travis Rice, Robin Van Gyn and Bryan Fox on an expedition. It'n to learn about nature. An expedition to ride some of the best backcountry on the planet. And, occasionally, an expedition to violently fall down a mountain to the peaceful hum of a violin. Mmm. Yeah. Depth Perception is somehow as earnest as it is tongue-in-cheek.","popularity":2.063,"poster_path":"/pPVwPmuaCLb3NJhP5Zzkt5Oopc2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quiksilver","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Travis Rice's latest production draws an unexpected vision on backcountry snowboarding.","title":"Depth Perception","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
