The title, Company Line, refers to the name historically used by residents to describe their neighborhood, located on the north side of town close to the old steel mill. The Company Line began during the post–war migration of Blacks from the south to the north in the late 1940’s. The neighborhood was purchased in the early 1970’s and its residents were scattered throughout Mansfield. City employees and former residents of the Company Line narrate accounts of past and present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wwh5XhXsBj7WSFtOh9IYvxETs5j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Company Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
