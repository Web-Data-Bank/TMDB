Alice is sitting on a riverbank with her sister when a fully-dressed, talking rabbit runs past her. She follows the rabbit down the hole and enters a nonsensical world where it seems the normal rules of logic do not apply. In Wonderland, Alice participates in a winner-less race, alternates between being tiny and giant, hears riddles at a \"mad\" tea party, plays croquet with live flamencos, and attends a trial where the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. Join Alice as she encounters the Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, and others as she makes her way through Wonderland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b5CGrIAiTHBqIjmATM8fohbXu50.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice in Wonderland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
