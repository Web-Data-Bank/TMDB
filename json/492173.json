A step further in the so-called sub-genre practice of found footage film – recycled material – is also put forward for consideration in this project. The appropriationism applied in this work makes use of material found in Hollywood cinema (Singin’in the rain, Stanley Donen & Gene Kelly, 1952); Pink Panther; Buster Keaton; etc., the first avant-garde period (Un chien andalou, Luis Buñuel & Salvador Dalí, 1929) and American experimental film (Wavelength, Michael Snow, 1966-1967). Such method makes possible, therefore, to maintain image ecology while it provides an analysis of the history of cinema. — AP","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sNgdD1DKnsTPxN4WhAI90YSMQyt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film Quartet/Polyframe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
