It's been years since Brigitte has seen her sister Candide or their recently-deceased mother, though when she is called on to sing at the funeral her since of duty supercedes any lingering family conflicts. But it's obvious that Candide harbors a lingering grudge, and as the alienated sisters come together in grief at their mother's country home unspoken hostilities gradually simmer to the surface. Both siblings are noted singer songwriters; Candide specializing in a more delicate brand of acoustic ballads and Brigitte using her talents to exorcise a lingering inner rage. The history of their relationship is written in Candide's lyrics, providing remarkable insight into the sibling's stormy relationship. Eventually, Brigitte discovers a tape of her mother's old music, leading the two sisters to collaborate on a song that could finally help to begin the healing process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p4oe8v1K3bT1NVmTXAsuX9g9fYz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mona's Daughters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
