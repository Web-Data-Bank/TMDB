His only friend is Julia, a shameless 15-year-old girl who is more than willing to help Pablo with his transition from childhood to adolescence, and give him some advice on sex, love, and life in general. On a quiet country road just outside of the village, Pablo meets Paco, an oddly calm, well-dressed stranger whose car just broke down. Nevertheless, he seems more interested in the boy than fixing his problem.","popularity":2.442,"poster_path":"/cRCb1NAJZNks3xU8RNuR9mMMcJb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiny Sumo Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":10659,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iván Noel Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A betrayal that ended a childhood.","title":"In Your Absence","video":false,"vote_average":6.125,"vote_count":21}
