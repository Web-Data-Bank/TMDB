As the film starts, Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are sitting around as filming has just completed. From here we get some terrific stories as they talk about the characters as well as what they bring and take from them. We also get footage from the filming of the movie where we get to see how the actors and director work together to try and build up the scenes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qZ8SlyybZPwnuBjOtbHU15mM0LC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Before","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
