Desperation drives him to make a deal with the Devil, who makes a bet with him. For the next seven years, he will carry a purse of gold that's always full. However, he must wear a bearskin and neither pray nor wash nor cut his hair in all that time. If he survives, he can keep the purse, but if he dies, the Devil gets his soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dwjDTmQMF38fkAFY9AhWhVQpXqx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Davenport Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bearskin, or The Man Who Didn't Wash for Seven Years","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
