Sade was born in 1755 and already in 1778 he was sentenced to a years-long prison, which was renewed by himself because of the writing of \"scandalous\" texts. This saved his life after the French revolution, but he soon came into conflict with Robespierre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sade en procès","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
