At a time when greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are at their highest levels in history, with people experiencing the significant impacts of climate change, including shifting weather patterns, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events, Akomfrahâ€™s Purple brings a multitude of ideas into conversation. These include animal extinctions, the memory of ice, the plastic ocean and global warming. Akomfrah has combined hundreds of hours of archival footage with newly shot film and a hypnotic sound score to produce the video installation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3sEZk97vweJagr0GMdMhLgWxSKj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Purple","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
