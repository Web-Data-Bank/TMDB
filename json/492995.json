In \"Two Friends, A Century of Music\", Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil celebrate their 50 years of career by retaking the partnership on stage. In simple and intimate arrangements, Gil and Caetano celebrate brilliant trajectories that began in the same place: Bahia. It was from the friendship that began at the time that they were students, that the two singers and composers gave origin to a partnership that, years later, would base one of the most expressive movements of Brazilian art, Tropicália.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sUtE3ICslJX8gUNPlyuXsDM8djW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Friends, a Century of Music","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
