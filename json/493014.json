In this fascinating meld of career retrospective and film essay, Greenfield offers a meditation on her extensive body of work, structuring it through the lens of materialism and its increasing sway on culture and society in America and throughout the world. Underscoring the ever-increasing gap between the haves and the have-nots, her portraits reveal a focus on cultivating image over substance, where subjects unable to attain actual wealth instead settle for its trappings, no matter their ability to pay for it.","popularity":5.987,"poster_path":"/lMTdKAKTrZqHZ2t6Cnit0SBAcbz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evergreen Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":20580,"logo_path":"/oRR9EXVoKP9szDkVKlze5HVJS7g.png","name":"Amazon Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":66478,"logo_path":"/u7WmMkfo9MqsqfD5cuDAbd0u1qY.png","name":"Artemis Rising","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12219,"logo_path":"/cU5xtXF1NbOEdtwQNJTGC1IlHBS.png","name":"Cinereach","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/tpaJr0p9DUCm4xWrdR6YwuI6TjP.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10029,"logo_path":"/dvWOehJOwxDSCHiHspvKEmaaWsO.png","name":"Candescent Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The American dream just keeps getting more expensive.","title":"Generation Wealth","video":false,"vote_average":6.573,"vote_count":82}
