His marriage seems to go nowhere as the passion, tenderness and happiness vanished when their daughter moved out. On top of that he owns an antique hardware store which is close to bankruptcy. While driving home Max is involved in a traffic accident which gives him amnesia. Confused, lost and in a disordered state, he wanders into a camp full of Latin American farm workers. There he finds a new meaning of life, happiness and a sense of belonging. However, as his memory slowly returns, it's inevitable that he must confront his past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r85LL8M1eJLz5kG0Q7k1BtGNXQ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184892,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter K.
