The camera pans very slowly, exploring the ground and the world. There's a buzzing in the air. Something is different. The seemingly na√Øve animation reveals a tranquility - as similarly puzzling as the sudden procession of creatures passing through the forest. A funeral? Fish accompany them. The meadow is populated with beetles and butterflies. The year's cycle is complete. The leaves fall and the being sleeps. Dreamt and dreamy is the procession, the time. Just like Piezke, Popov's dormouse friend, whose favorite pastime is sleeping. The year draws to a close.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7etsM02N2Saup2v3G9I7CVaaFjw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Mangosteen (JP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vita Lakamaya","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
