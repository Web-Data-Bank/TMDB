She lives with an emotionally disturbed gambler, Hugo, who is her boyfriend and occasionally her pimp; he sees through this odd role-playing game and tries to save Maria from what he perceives as danger, while she increasingly loses herself in Judith's identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3448,"logo_path":"/dcA8JDfnnQPMaq8lv2CCiYrNe0S.png","name":"ITV","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pretending to Be Judith","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
