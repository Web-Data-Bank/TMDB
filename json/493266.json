Now, as never before, audiences are invited to witness the events of the days preceding the martyrdom. Based on documents handed down through the generations, Carthage offers a glimpse into the turmoil and testimony of the men whose place in history was forever defined by what was to come - a jailer seeking to protect his charges, a governor caught between the persecuted and their persecutors, and a group of Saints whose faith and brotherhood stands as the ultimate witness of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/sQ5f9qAlnvczVcxvAdTNpwYKXCS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They lived for glory, they died for glory, & glory is their eternal reward.","title":"Carthage","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
