The guests of Tallinn's legendary cafes \"Pearl\" and \"Moscow\" were filmed in their own time. The uniqueness of the film is expressed through a strangely independent soundtrack that observes everyday bustle from the heights of melancholy poetry and remote uranography. Artur Alliksaar's poetry is read by Aarne Üksküla.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/adTMsOLUyw9XpSZ5je3X1PWKvjl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"511 Best Photographs of Mars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
