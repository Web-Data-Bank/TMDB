Set in the bowels of an iconic derelict Los Angeles high-rise, we follow Lauren and her real-estate investing fianc√© as they discover first hand what happens when a madman leads not with emotion, but rather chilling rationality. The Man in question brings a heaping helping of sanity and jet-black humor to the crazy table. The result is a wonderfully off-kilter horror/thriller that never goes where we expect, but rather draws the audience deeper into a surprising world that has dark corners even in the brightest rooms.","popularity":0.763,"poster_path":"/fFbFJXwLFAuOqzG47xDnwKUx41R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pain Brings Out The Truth In Us All ...
