But these Overseas Chinese patriots are persecuted in various political campaigns and their daughter subject to discrimination from childhood. The male lead freezes to death as a fugitive and draws a giant question mark in the snow before dying. The daughter emigrates following the Cultural Revolution; when her relatives try to stop her, she says: \"You love the motherland, but does the motherland love you?\" Based on a script by Bai Hua, SUN AND MAN was completed in 1981 but permanently shelved following high-level criticism and a public campaign against its \"anti-Party\" character. The film is said to survive in the studio archive but has never been publicly screened. A Taiwanese adaptation of the script (with some modifications) was released in 1982 under the English title PORTRAIT OF A FANATIC.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lX98DCGRmR9pTzc7FiTHnR7UDbl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Changchun Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sun and Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
