Every year, many young people leave their villages and move there. They are between 17 and 20, all from rural Yunnan Province, 2,500 km west, where the Yangtze River has its source. These young Yunnanese often live at their place of work, in dormitories, unsanitary rooms, or sometimes in small studios. Time and space to meet is missing them. So they communicate through QQ, MSN China. They live as adults but they are teenagers, and the unstable situation, economic pressures, geographical dispersion, burn their innocence and youth. Wang Bing will spend a year with them in Liming: at work, at home, on the Internet, every day of their professional, romantic, and friendly relations. At the end of the year he will follow them in the opposite direction to their province of origin, to be with their family and celebrate Chinese New Year.","popularity":10.543,"poster_path":"/iD6sdQPLz2th2UKun7FgzLv0Pcx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98661,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yisha Production","origin_country":""},{"id":16633,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gladys Glover","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":74860,"logo_path":"/tyFziA12tafTrEncGLpP0kI5UrL.png","name":"House on Fire","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chinese Shadows","origin_country":""},{"id":72130,"logo_path":"/2aZx0CKefgtSJEwU5TBLX7oXwyR.png","name":"Les Films Fauves","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":212,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Youth (Spring)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
