He obtains information leading to a U.S. drone strike on a wanted terrorist in Zahiristan. A few days later, there's a terrorist attack on a restaurant – the video claiming responsibility calls it payback for the drone strike. Freelance journalist Aurice, with whom Martin was having an affair, is among the victims – she was investigating corruption at the heart of the BND. Martin soon has to realize that in a world where big corporations profit from arms deals as well as from homeland security contracts, good and evil are sometimes hard to tell apart.","popularity":5.469,"poster_path":"/v6yytlK5AK1nSGKjbf2GK5nekrw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25828,"logo_path":"/ikU6I2MtiJsupBMhDPHpcS8hre6.png","name":"Walker \u0026 Worm Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":67049,"logo_path":"/rMleYBpiJNDFdWt9zVXJJETIDta.png","name":"Hellinger / Doll Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Trust no one.","title":"Blame Game","video":false,"vote_average":5.983,"vote_count":29}
