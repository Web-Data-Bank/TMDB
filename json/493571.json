Written in 1668, the play has been somewhat dwarfed by such like-vintage Moliere classics as The Imaginary Invalid. Still, it was popular enough in its time to inspire imitation, most notably Betterton's Don Juan and The Amorous Widow. The plot, involving a wealthy man's avoidance of marriage until he is trapped by a crafty widow, is but a peg upon which to hang any number of comic complications and character vignettes. Brasseur's leading lady is the toothsome Zabou.","popularity":0.822,"poster_path":"/zwUbeHAWzk3CPVvIRxknvf8ioMS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dandin","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
