Nobody could have known that two of the boys in the picture would go on to make film history: they were director Sergio Leone and composer Ennio Morricone. Another boy sat between this duo destined for world fame. What could have become of him? Denise Janzee took the photo back to Trastevere to discover the identity of the unknown boy. A taxi driver, an old barber, a retired lawyer, a doctor, a priest, another filmmaker—these are just a few of the locals who puzzle over Janzee’s question. But not everyone sees its importance. Why would you make a film about an ordinary person, when you can see ordinary people anywhere? As the picture of this unknown man gradually emerges, My Name Is Nobody also profiles the interviewees, the neighborhood and a society in which fame is regarded as the utmost virtue—so if nobody has ever heard of you, what do you have left?","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/pQpZ90eVJWlygoXsx4pLZxJyg6Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Name Is Nobody","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
