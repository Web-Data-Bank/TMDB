Across town, Lesia Lysenko, the only girl from an immigrant family at Todd's conservative, Catholic High School, clashes with her strict, Ukrainian father, who insists that Lesia take her younger brother to chaperone her to that same school dance. As Lesia experiments with a newfound sense of rebellion, Todd is asked out by a clueless, smitten girl with a pet hate of pop music. He practises the dance moves from Ruslana's song in his family's tool shed and hatches a secret plan to get the song played at the disco. The film moves towards its fabulous, genuinely heartwarming climax as Lesia and Todd learn that life begins when you dance to your own beat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2MQ0VaKBaCKgQzN3DWxtmlXHLyX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Dances","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
