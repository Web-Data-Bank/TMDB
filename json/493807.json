More specifically, his obsession with motorbikes and the invention of the racing bike which was the by-product of his relationship with Stunt Double Bud Ekins and the film they were in together, 'The Great Escape'. As the two men shared their enthusiasm for motorbikes, it was a natural progression for them to work together in Bud's motorbike shop in California, fixing , tinkering and riding, and working to improve performance. This brought about their concept of combining a Metisse frame and a Triumph engine for a new track racing bike. McQueen decided to take this model to England where he met up with the Rickman brothers of Metisse motorbikes, and the 'Desert Racer' was soon born.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jxodhMXtPq9UAMsBA3gcSosTrmI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steve McQueen: Desert Racer","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
