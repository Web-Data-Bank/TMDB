But both men share a desire: to defy gravity, to rise up against the limitations of their bodies. As a very composed and rational person, Christian has mastered the techniques of paragliding, and, after years of struggle, he has been given permission to fly on his own. He is now persuading the more erratic and turbulent Bruce to do the same and follow him all the way to Mont Blanc... An intimate and moving portrait of two non-conforming individuals, this \"direct cinema\" piece with surrealist undertones takes us on a journey into the luminous heights and the dark intricacies of the human psyche.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112119,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matthieu Brouillard","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regarding Gravity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
