The hunt begins and bankruptcies, bad luck and mishaps are inevitable. Of course, Father Frost and his chubby assistant Snegurochka, the snowflake, switch on and complete the hustle and bustle.  In 2005, the witch Baba Jaga saw the light of the theater world with this piece and became a cult.  Almost half a million spectators have since visited Baba Yaga on her subsequent adventures.  Today, nine years later, the first part has lost nothing of its charm - still the little ones are happy about the crazy witch and the big ones laugh when Father Frost saves his big snowflake from bursting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z6YnJWGTW3ZZ9IfOqYeAc6O2Abg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98812,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gebr.
