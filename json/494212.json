Here, the nuclear industry plans to bury the most radioactive and therefore the most dangerous nuclear waste from French (or even European) power plants. The project dates from the early 2000s, and immediately gave rise to opposition from citizens, politicians and scientists. Fruit of these struggles, a few kilometers from what is still only a laboratory, a house of resistance to the nuclear dustbin, to this energy and to its world (that's its name), was born a little more than ten years, where activists meet, exchange their know-how, fight, and imagine the world of tomorrow. A unique place in Europe that this documentary proposes to present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Bure for eternity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
