Director Bill Zebub has trimmed all of the filler from the standard serial killer movie and replaced it with a near constant barrage of depraved sexual horror. \"Most serial killer films favor soap opera dialogue and speculation-depictions of the killer doing anything but the vile deeds for which he became famous. This movie shows ONLY the deranged part of the serial killer's story.\" - Bill Zebub WARNING: This film contains graphic nudity and sexual assault and in intended only for mature audiences.","popularity":3.234,"poster_path":"/kDPrraIulT8aTF8ANPIlXwSvQG4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rough Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":6325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Extreme Digital Grap","origin_country":""},{"id":20952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill Zebub Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't call me Father.
