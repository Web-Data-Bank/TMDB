Finally, less than usual ... With 0/40 years old, where he tells his life from birth to today, the humorist wanted to abandon the macho character who had made his success. But for lack of common thread and inventive staging, the show turns out to be wobbly. Not bad, certainly, with even a few good moments, but not convincing either. If the initiative was laudable, the result is likely to satisfy neither the frustrated fans of not finding everything they liked nor those who wanted to discover Olivier de Benoist in another register. Recorded in La Halle aux vins, parc des exposition, Colmar.","popularity":0.776,"poster_path":"/iyjd0a2kAdzLT33bqmHH14FznDL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ki m'aime me suive","origin_country":""},{"id":90917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Supermouche Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":91532,"logo_path":null,"name":"C8 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":133306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comedie +","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olivier De Benoist : 0-40 Ans","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
