She’s skinny and quite bad at basketball, but she really likes basketball. The problem is that her school doesn’t have enough players for a team, and they’re trying to dismiss the basketball team. So-eun doesn’t have anybody to share her frustration. Then one day, Yu-jin, a washed up movie actress, and Yong-sik, Yu-jin’s fan who also goes to the same school as So-eun, appear in So-eun’s life. Now, So-eun’s time starts to run quite differently from before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lyExbpcc15eNGKobqhWmV3A7Eli.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hoop It Up","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
