Thirty years later her daughter (the filmmaker) attempts to recreate her last performance through documentation, memory and contemporary restagings. The inspiration for the original dance began with Green’s ancestral oral history of her great-grandmother’s husband who was lost at sea. The film references the temporal space between each rendition of the story; the cyclical (dis)appearance of what is just out of reach: the husband, the story and the dance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under Green Waves","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
