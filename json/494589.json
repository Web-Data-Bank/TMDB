The camera documents a group of 20 people gathered in a hall to perform. The cast includes real-life performers whose skills range from the mundane to the extraordinary: a hula hooper, a singer, a pizza dough thrower, speed skippers, tap dancers, gymnasts and dog trainers. Two men make salami, a woman gets a haircut and someone eats too many hotdogs. Hrabluikâ€™s editing creates an exquisite corpse, connecting the performers as their bodies tap out a spellbinding rhythm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Splits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
