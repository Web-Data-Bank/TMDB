One day, one of her regulars engages her in a conversation that leads to an unusual friendship, as these two worldly souls share their common experiences.","popularity":3.031,"poster_path":"/rbIKG3YWvJg96XTRRGssArKH1yC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porn Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":18}
