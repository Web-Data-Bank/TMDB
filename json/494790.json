Zaccheus uses his wealth and power to further his own selfish ends, but everything changes when Jesus comes to supper.  The film was shot by veteran cinematographer John Alton (Elmer Gantry) and is notable for its effective use of light and shadow, most notably when Jesus is strongly back-lit giving a halo effect.  Adapted from the story of Zaccheus as told in the Gospel according to St. Luke: Chapter 19: Verses 1-10.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vAtILbXzolXqiD7A8AwTX8sLuAl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1942-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Greater Power","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
