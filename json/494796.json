The son of pastors raised in the segregated South, Jackson entered college at 14 and took office at 35. During his three-term tenure, he led the city through the traumatic Atlanta child murders scare and triumphantly hosted the 1996 Olympics, all while championing racial equality. Family and colleagues, including Bill Clinton, Andrew Young and Al Sharpton, tell the epic story of a dynamic leader and his legacy of honor and progress.","popularity":0.742,"poster_path":"/e7L4iBhK31O4YaWKuWEe7gwbNtd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Auburn Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-10","revenue":68,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mayor Maynard!","title":"Maynard","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
