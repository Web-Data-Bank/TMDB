She was the supermodel who became Andy Warhol’s most notorious muse and the singer of legendary American rock band Velvet Underground. She had a troublesome love story with Jim Morrison and gave her son his first shot. She was a nomad, always on her way to Paris, London, or New York and stood in the center of the sixties’ art revolution.  In \"Nico – Sphinx of Ice\", we are taken on a journey through the psyche of the broken and unbreakable sixties’ icon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/59IWpDgAcnJoGmXFyycMoZATJUE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kulturbryggan","origin_country":""},{"id":41352,"logo_path":"/nLJlcIh5W5mdJ86d5ClxuY4YZr7.png","name":"Kungliga Dramatiska Teatern","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":84741,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blixten \u0026 Co","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"64","title":"Nico - Sphinx of Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
