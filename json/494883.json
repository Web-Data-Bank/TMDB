Michael Grandage's staging is no less than the seventh in the festival's history, and sets the opera in the sleazy Sixties. Directed by Robin Ticciati, the production was lauded for its \"ideal pacing\" and youthful cast (which includes \"no weak link\" and \"looks gorgeous\"â€”The Sunday Times), and continues Glyndebourne's rewarding explorations of Mozart and Da Ponte's \"day of madness\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A9mIpsMPbJMQqSmrYDdwZeZ9X5r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marriage of Figaro","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
