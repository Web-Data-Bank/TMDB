The film centers on a working-class couple, Roy and Jan Stennis (played by Robert Viharo and Sharon Goldman), who live, with their two children, in a cramped tract home. An assembly line worker in a steel plant, Roy entertains the escapist fantasy of moving from the local semi-pro baseball team for which he plays third base, to the big leagues. \"It's just a matter of being in the right place at the right time,\" he figures. However, when Roy simultaneously loses his job (by being at the right place at the right time - coming to the defense of a black co-worker and thus being branded a trouble-maker) and his one chance to impress an interested baseball scout, his life begins to unravel. The strains on his marriage increase, intensified by Jan's decision to take a job, and Roy begins to isolate himself both from his family and his fellow workers.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":"/5EyTE1fHNlDAw0GRGsGFTx3oXdY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over-Under Sideways-Down","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
