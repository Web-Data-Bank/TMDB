Digital and analog video techniques are used to simulate painterly effects in an interplay between soft, harsh, mat and shiny surfaces, different shades of light and the illusion of depth or flatness. Biomes are portraits of post human environments where uncanny life forms materialize and slowly detach themselves from the horizon, to finally melt into their respective landscapes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/drqWV0tLNJ9jUL9qMYYm7yI8NQ6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biomes IV","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
