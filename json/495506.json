Dekeukeleire transformed him into a butcher who commits an act of rebellion during a political demonstration at the foot of the Yser Tower (with authentic images of the 1930 meeting) which is being suppressed brutally by the authorities. White Flame secretes a drifting air of unreality straight out of Bu√±uel, born out of 'carnal' close-ups and an editing style which owes a great deal to Soviet films of that period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nwf2hiP1drvFgp8C5MnD4sdcJQd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1930-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Flame","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
