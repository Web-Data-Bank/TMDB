Throughout it all, Madden has maintained an uncanny charm, clever wit, endless creativity, and a keen instinct that has shaken the fashion world to its core.","popularity":2.017,"poster_path":"/1pUAjQeBcRW3wBScDZrraPVXn99.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Onslot Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maddman: The Steve Madden Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":8}
