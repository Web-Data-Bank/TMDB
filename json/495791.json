Two identical films mirror each other. The only thing that differentiates between them is colour and sound, which is simply reversed. Through the use of just colour and sound, each part invokes unique sensations in the viewer; one of sorrow, and one of fear. Not a single identifiable object features. Instead, the films focus on repetition, texture, movement and light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/L3MeCSpMsXdN6bj6M2ItnECefl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ether Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Permanence / Swan Blood","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
