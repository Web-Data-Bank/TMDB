With intentions to launch a bloody crusade against the government, warrior Endo Tadaoki (Henry Lee) gathers his remaining men to prepare for one last honorable battle against the emperor and regain the supremacy of the samurai. As fellow warrior Kido Masahide (Vint Carmona) refuses to join the war, he and his wife are brutally murdered at the hands of Endo's blade before being robbed of their family swords. When Kido's only son (Michael Nos√©) is also pressured to join Endo's forces, he instead chooses a fatal confrontation with his parents' assailant. Suffering from a rare medical condition that renders his skin allergic to water, Ken embarks on his quest to find a sword and avenge his family's death.","popularity":0.878,"poster_path":"/cPYmJje4rATZrT24M5iCIXWyFmx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dry Blade","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
