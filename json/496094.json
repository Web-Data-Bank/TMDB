Praise the Lard presents an incisive, engaging take on how the unsuspecting pig took on such an outsized role in the land of Israel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Praise the Lard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
