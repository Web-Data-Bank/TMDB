Now, with this beautiful animated film, your family can experience the true power of this extraordinary story. Adam is alone, but eventually God decides to give him a companion and creates Eve.  For a time, it seems that they will live indefinitely in Paradise, until the story takes a tragic turn.

When God discovers what has happened, He banishes Adam and Eve from the Garden, and they must struggle for survival.

It reflects our own struggle to survive - and our hope that someday we will rejoin God in Paradise.","popularity":0.947,"poster_path":"/8NEdWUXtmXlfjGByKcVPAL7VZ0q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12313,"logo_path":null,"name":"GoodTimes Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth...\" With those words, the biblical story of creation begins","title":"Greatest Heroes and Legends of The Bible: The Garden of Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
