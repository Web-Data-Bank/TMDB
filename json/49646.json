Sharing the same lead actress (Brigitte Mira), cinematographer (Jürgen Jürges), and editor (Thea Eymèsz) as in Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1974 Film “Angst essen Seele auf”, these twin works offer a searing indictment of prejudice within German society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6zGrhhh1gehTC1eVHXIexXTeFHx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yilmaz Arslan Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angst isst Seele auf","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":3}
