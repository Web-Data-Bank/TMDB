The modest act of eating and the sensations it gives us provided Keiko a lifeline to survive. Unwillingly, she joins a group of Japanese women traveling to Northern Europe to participate in a kimono show in the fairytale-like art nouveau world of Riga. During her performance, Keiko suddenly comes face to face with her husband, who disappeared twenty years ago and now wants to read-dress their relationship and who Keiko has become.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mu4nSpKVUHkqSM0dy1olu65U6qc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25740,"logo_path":null,"name":"KrukFilms","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":107223,"logo_path":"/9adJ4yCBE6JRgLoLiNo6u9szwbP.png","name":"Loaded Films","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic Kimono","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
