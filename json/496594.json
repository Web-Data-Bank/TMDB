Before he is formally charged by the police, he sets out on a two-day odyssey to find the real killer: tracking down his leads from the backseat of a rented limousine. This allows him to converse and ponder class, society, life in the city, and to contemplate the dirt that runs in the small nooks and valleys of cosmopolitan life. Mid-way through the film, the style transforms into Brividio Giallo contemporary, wordless operatic imagery of sex and violence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/szMMOx9hpUcYxwvvdwHrF9N4Sz5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the valley of the rats there is no chair for the lords of the earth.","title":"Valley of the Rats","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
