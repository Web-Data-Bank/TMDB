Hollywood churns out movies and TV shows that deal with otherworldly themes at a rate that is unprecedented. Studies and surveys confirm that despite the growing influence of science and philosophical materialism (the idea that the material world is all that there is) belief in a spiritual world is, if anything, on the rise.  But while belief in the supernatural is strong, any type of consensus about what the metaphysical world is like is on the wane. Relativism and multiculturalism have fostered the idea that it’s “whatever you think it is…as long as you’re sincere.” Well, what if it isn’t? What if spiritual realities and decrees are just a firm and immutable as the laws that govern our material world?","popularity":0.642,"poster_path":"/rzvCJxLwZEK8gzRES8zKv7pXnUg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99344,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel 2 Real Ministries","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Apologetics Group’s explosive evangelistic presentation that doubles as a primer on world religions and the occult.","title":"Shadows of the Supernatural","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
