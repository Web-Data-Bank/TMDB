Like kids the world over, they are pursuing a dream :an electric blue, 18 gear mountain bike. The boys can't possibly afford such a bike, but a poster offering a reward for finding a lost dog raises their hopes. The boys experience adventures and set back in their pursuit of dog and bike, through crowded alleys and market places of the old city, into inner sanctum of a prophetic seer, and to an abandoned temple where a 'holy' man steals their money. Overwhelmed by obstacles, their friendship is tested. Through the pursuit of their dreams, however, the boys discover what's really important in life-something bigger than the bicycle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/csQTJbICvWEIK5i0bjgG8NExEsC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bicycle Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
