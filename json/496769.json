The situation is seen from the perspective of outspoken Thai human-rights activist Kraisak Choonhavan, who, while making the journey southward, reveals an unseen side of the Muslim community. After living alongside Buddhists peacefully for generations, a large number of the Muslim population seems to have suddenly become violent. Over the course of just two years, over fifty Buddhists teachers have been killed. But why? As the Muslim separatist attacks become increasingly intense and Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra responds with growing force from military and government, a mutual mistrust on both sides paves he path towards violence and tragedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sqFbnDkmnYIjZnCCIH4VVBjYYta.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":222,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A road movie through Thailand's soul","title":"Citizen Juling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
