Colloquially known as Nollywood, this thriving film industry turns out approximately 2000 new features every year, generating $250 million in the process and making it a close third to Hollywood and Bollywood in terms of cash generated. In addition to speaking with the producer who plays a crucial role in getting many of these films made, Wenner also speaks with people like editor and 3D effects specialist Maimunah Sayyadi who can frequently be found in the editing room with an infant on her lap as she edits the works of her husband Faruk, a prolific Nigerian filmmaker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8M1fOrlofOjuikq5ZW7DyDDlRMm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peace Mission","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
