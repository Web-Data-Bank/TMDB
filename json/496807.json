Law alternates between peculiar imagery and bizarre flights of fancy and the self referential as he deconstructs his own routine whilst performing it. He frequently breaks from the chaotic narrative of Maximum Nonsense to indulge in meta-comedy, pointing out uncomfortable non-sequiturs and his lack of one liners, before bringing the whole show to a close with an extended joke about his apparent inability to finish a joke.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":"/1njpZ9PO9HWhm6oOHpdznVPO3JS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tony Law: Maximum Nonsense","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
