While he nominally runs a courier business to earn a living, he seems to spend most of his time smoking his pipe, drinking sake, and chasing women. The arrival of a Shinsengumi squad led by a young swordswman, Ichimonji Hyougo, disrupts this peaceful routine, forcing Kumosuke to defend himself.","popularity":1.207,"poster_path":"/xhke1bCq8cD8D04WiC833pMzMQx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5542,"logo_path":"/ayE4LIqoAWotavo7xdvYngwqGML.png","name":"Toei Animation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3464,"logo_path":"/9k0nr75nwnNeT2MHerf1OXJN0hj.png","name":"Madhouse","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1982-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drifting Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
