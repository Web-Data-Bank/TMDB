She is surrounded not only by painter Diego Rivera, but also by Leon Trotsky, Andr√© Breton, Sergei Eisenstein, Pablo Neruda, Waldo Frank, Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Vassily Kandinsky, etc.  As Mexico gears up to commemorate 200 years of national independence and the 100th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution, our film recalls the great adventures of \"The Blue House\" : its parties, its manifestoes, its artists, its freewheeling love affairs, its betrayals... as well as its unlikely melding of art and revolution, of Surrealism and Mexico, of the Old and the New Worlds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Frida Kahlo's","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
