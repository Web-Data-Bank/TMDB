This documentary uses interviews and newsreel footage to examine the conflict between the French and the Vietnamese. In addition to Vietnam, French Indochina also included Cambodia and Laos. The French-Indochina War lasted from 1946 to 1956, when a Geneva Conference agreement mandated a cease-fire in a temporarily divided Vietnam. It is well to note that it is only after this time that the two Vietnams went to war against each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1a1gtcGjJ46p43x1fTK4k2K5AKG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La république est morte à Diên Biên Phu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
