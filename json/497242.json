Some members of the Jewish community joined them. A surprising number, more mystically inclined, did not. This French film takes us to one remote Polish estate, where patriots are arming themselves to fight Germans. Several Jews who sought to join them are admitted by the group's leader, but they are violently dealt with by the other anti-Semitic members of the group.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d6TFBoz5QDWvCcbzxdqEhRIk2WO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tear in the Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
