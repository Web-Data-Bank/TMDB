As Raymond (Richard Bohringer) sits on a ledge of his apartment building, and people try to talk him back inside, he remembers the events of his day and his life before this moment. Things seemed to be going along well enough until something triggered his revulsion at the pettiness and falseness that is the everyday currency of life.","popularity":0.716,"poster_path":"/9513GDYLddF7rfT7h90hlfs0WkQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saga","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":98279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Service de la Recherche de l'ORTF","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17763,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunchild Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1973-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Italian of the Roses","video":false,"vote_average":5.333,"vote_count":3}
