He was inspired for one of the dance by tribal Indian dances of Louisiana performed by Metchigaema chiefs, in Paris in 1723. Clément Cogitore adapts a short part of the ballet by mobilizing a group of Krump dancers, an art form born in Los Angeles black ghetto in the 1990s. Its birth occurred in the aftermath of the beating up of Rodney King and the riots, as well as police repression it triggered. Amidst this coercive atmosphere, young dancers started to embody the violent tensions of the physical, social and political body. Both the tribal dance performed in Paris in 1723, and the rebelious Krump dancers of the 1990s shape a reenactment of Rameau’s original libretto, staging young people dancing on the verge of a volcano.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/2z6D4BtqRj6eed6MYAQmQxzmtS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Amorous Indies","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":11}
