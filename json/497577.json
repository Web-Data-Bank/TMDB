In a dusty hotel room, a depressed husband (Lloyd Kaufman) reads a \"Dear John\" letter from his long suffering spouse. In another location, an old man (Tyree) tells the tale of his randy rollercoaster existence -- and the hunchback son he fathered. In a trailer across town, a recluse (Vietnam Ron) is loosing his eyesight and reflects on his failed relationship with his blonde bimbo wife (Maryanne Spychalski). Elsewhere, a flamboyant real estate agent entertains clients and friends in a tumble down track house. Together they form the spine of a storyline that shifts between scatological discussions of intestinal gas and equally meaningful mediations on contentment, and the pursuit of friendship.","popularity":1.342,"poster_path":"/7ca2Mj6mgtw8e9diOzfQN7oOiEI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Okie Dokie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
