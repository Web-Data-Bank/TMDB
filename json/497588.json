Still working at age 94, Kevin Roche is an enigma, a man with no interest in fame who refuses retirement and continually looks to the future regardless of age. Roche's architectural philosophy is that 'the responsibility of the modern architect is to create a community for a modern society' and has emphasised the importance for peoples well-being to bring nature into the buildings they inhabit. We consider the application of this philosophy in acclaimed buildings such as the Ford Foundation, Oakland Museum and at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art for whom Kevin Roche was their principal architect for over 40 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lmlghS4ReXkjoUbwL6fj2JUWIe6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kevin: Roche The Quiet Architect","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
