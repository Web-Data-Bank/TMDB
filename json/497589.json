The tape's paranoid, tormented protagonist — who is represented by such objects as a spoon and a water-filled sack — wanders through a hostile dreamspace of macabre obsessions and sexual alienation. Incredibly, Oursler renders this unlikely anti-hero as a sympathetic, totally believable \"character.\" The artist's somnambulant, pun-laden narration and astonishing visual inventiveness add black humor to the surreal proceedings; for example, a bar scene is populated by an outrageous \"cast\" of found-object grotesques. Oursler's classic happy ending, in which The Loner \"would live a wonderful life,\" rings with an ironic desperation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Loner","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
