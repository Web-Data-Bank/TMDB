The terror being inflicted on the populace is not just corporal but intensely psychological as well. They were constantly fed with apocryphal tales about the village leader. A few souls are not giving up. They are fighting. The poet/teacher/activist, Hugo Haniway, decides to find out the truth about the disappearance of his wife. A love story set in the darkest period of Philippine history, the Marcos Dictatorship. The narrative and the characters are a composite of real events and real people that happened and existed during the period. A Filipino rock opera.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/e1ufcl7n1NsptRHb9TLEvR0ouaV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33812,"logo_path":"/fwpLmRnRFxnYg9mD8K4FOb0GqwT.png","name":"Sine Olivia Pilipinas","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":57612,"logo_path":"/dg4sSBjn9pv5mswjUxItrPLZf6X.png","name":"Epicmedia","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2018-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":234,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Season of the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":10}
