Through 68 Pages of a counselors diary, we see the stories of Paayal, a sex worker; Nishit, an ID user; Kiran, a gay man and Umrao, a transsexual bar dancer - their stories of pain and fear, humiliation and rejection - not only by the society, but even by their loved ones.","popularity":2.093,"poster_path":"/iuYBGcQ3GYRlDgZZnAnbnGiwDAM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solaris Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2007-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Marked by Pain, Bound by Hope","title":"68 Pages","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":5}
