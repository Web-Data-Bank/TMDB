It is a film, where two sisters from Lithuania - a filmmaker and a photographer - take a journey through their German grandmother's past. During the research authors encounter her love story, fleeing, uncomfort of being German in Soviet Lithuania and chain of suicides in their family. It's time to talk. About everything. Long journey, which leads in two directions - towards other person and yourself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ylodnozNnDnGYRUwEnRVIb5cCO3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2017-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What We Leave Behind","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
