BUT IT SEEMS THAT 21ST CENTURY LIVING HAS BROUGHT ON ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THAT COULD STRESS OUT EVEN THE MELLOWEST OF PEOPLE.  THE GOOD NEWS: Christians throughout the ages have struggled with stress, from Psalmists to Jeremiah to John Bunyan to Charles Spurgeon. You are not alone.  THE BETTER NEWS: There is a Biblical cure. Jesus is fully aware that we struggle with anxiety and He graciously preached a sermon just for the anxious Christian.  THE BEST NEWS: God will give you the power to overcome your anxiety. God has given us His Holy Spirit precisely for this struggle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wretched Worldview - Anxiety","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
