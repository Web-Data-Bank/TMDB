But nothing could prepare her for the fight ahead: an intensely personal struggle against the U.S. Army when she becomes the highest ranking officer ever to be discharged for being a lesbian. With the support of her partner Diane (Judy Davis), Cammermeyer undertakes an against-all-odds battle against the Army's policy. But to do so, she must risk everything â€“ her career, her privacy and even the love of her family.","popularity":3.164,"poster_path":"/mHkVybbJ77ZNzEvsISQZypBSmE4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trillium Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":8609,"logo_path":"/aX7HQqzdIV7ttd90u4L1H643ZNa.png","name":"TriStar Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":11073,"logo_path":"/aCbASRcI1MI7DXjPbSW9Fcv9uGR.png","name":"Sony Pictures Television Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barwood Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1502,"logo_path":"/ywjcvHUiKxv7cYsestkONF8LieH.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"},{"id":169144,"logo_path":null,"name":"Storyline Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ask.
