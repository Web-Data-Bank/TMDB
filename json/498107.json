A visual journey into the far reaches of waterlogged consciousness, where the yearnings of the tummy meet the revulsion of the craniumâ€”a cranium mostly made up of water in the first place, like a head of cabbage. Besides, the video is more of a head-trip to the nether reaches of Neptune's haunts where tourists glide through guts of glass to ooh and aah at the mysteries of the deep-end.  Taped in Frisco, Baltimore, and Pacifica, let the salt air of this far-flung journey corrode the land-lubber blubber that beaches you upon the sands of sanity and render your sails impotent to the blows of the tradewind. Cast ahoy that anchor of dead meat between your thighs and let it plunge into the deep wetness from which we all ascended.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3O9KCr8cgIwM0O3ZpA8LPwmKb7p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aquatica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
