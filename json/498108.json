The tale is brought to life with all the opulence that an $800 budget can produce and the young cast of non-actors live up to their fullest foibles as the plot thickens with a mix of romance and wartime action intertwined with a musical number or two. The ambitions were high and the necklines low in this effects-laden tribute to pulp fiction fantasy and intergalactic intercourse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hZra7OmT3UOB3Fmvi5Q3wHKApXH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Planet of the Vamps","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
