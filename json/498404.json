Grikevicius's film is Tomas Petreikis, the chief engineer of the machine factory in Kaunas F. Dzer탑inskis. Rather than creating a regular, conjunctural narrative about the hero of socialist work that exceeds production norms, the director captures another personality of his film's hero. After work, Tom is an entertaining dancer, teacher and contest judge. \"Construction and dancing? No, they don't not have any relation,\" T. Petreikis answers the question posed by the journalist.
