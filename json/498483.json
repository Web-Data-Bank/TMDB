You know, instead of just giving Robin the week off, and because it’s impossible for two people to have a broken arm at the same time. The whole event comes together when Batman bewilders the world by wearing a costume that’s made up of straight-up rainbow stripes. Batman’s plan works, and all is right in the Silver Age world.","popularity":0.625,"poster_path":"/AhzUst82dsqO4ZU1alDY9o0S9E7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":429,"logo_path":"/2Tc1P3Ac8M479naPp1kYT3izLS5.png","name":"DC Comics","origin_country":"US"},{"id":9993,"logo_path":"/2Tc1P3Ac8M479naPp1kYT3izLS5.png","name":"DC Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Te Rainbow Batman","title":"Batman's Greatest Cases: Featuring the Rainbow Batman","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
