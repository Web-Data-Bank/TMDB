Talk about your musical prodigies. That would make him only 55 at the time of this performance. Although he is probably past his prime by now, his voice sounds better than ever and his Hammond B3 playing remains unparalleled.","popularity":2.54,"poster_path":"/7lg4XWveqCOAOQVxQUPCQaUxPKX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steve Winwood Live in Concert Soundstage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
