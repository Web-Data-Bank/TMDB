These cores bare their \"unconformities\"—temporal ruptures, natural disasters, geological movements—in full view, revealing a constant cycle of construction and deconstruction that is the defining feature of civilisations past and present, with each using the stones of the last. History appears not as layers but as actions, a kind of palimpsest mixing epochs and civilizations. These poetic recompositions question the dominant forms of narrating and representing history, but also address debates around the Anthropocene.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Palimpsests","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
