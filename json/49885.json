A pirate without a straight leg, without a boat, treacherous and bloodthirsty and without the treasure map.  A baroness flamboyant, unscrupulous, praying mantis, penniless, but with a boat.  A young man without fear and without brains, but with the treasure map engraved somewhere in his failing memory.  A doctor without drinking, providential specialist of failing memories and other atypical amnesia ...  It is this dream team that sails anchor one morning in the year of grace a thousand and seven hundred and a few, towards the treasure island and its coves of pink sand.","popularity":3.291,"poster_path":"/i02oRvMfF5j2MX5NSR0pi2aSwta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16026,"logo_path":null,"name":"FIT Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Île aux trésors","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":68}
