Lust for sex? Self-preservation? Childhood trauma? Father quest? Who can really see? A Police Officer who wants to bring Rosie back onto the right track does - but Rosie is too busy flirting with middle-aged men, destroying virtuous families and scheming her way up the social ladder, while also wallowing in seedy night clubs of the ’60ies wrestling Frida, the naked dancer hiding a rod, for Jim’s eyes only. Jim is not 100% sure which one of the two blondes he wants to kill so he might just make a serious mistake and kill Rosie. But is it really easy for a nymphet to be killed?","popularity":0.907,"poster_path":"/5QIUrWHvUfjz4zjGoBnEuma82tE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Faros Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lolitas of Athens","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
