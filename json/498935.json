The camp, military style of Pakistans rescue teams, with their marching and theatrical disaster exercises are a world away from the relaxed beachside work of the Hawaiians who stop for ice-cream at every turn.  On the other side of the globe, above the romantic canals of Venice, ambulance doctors and nurses watch a generation of old Venetians quietly die as tourists pass below.  Meanwhile, Mexican paramedics put their mind off the terror of the countrys drug war with their on-station games and madcap antics.","popularity":0.667,"poster_path":"/nTcaSCUJlArfrbuxrGySDOLAjBn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2012-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Around the world by Ambulance","title":"Paramedico","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
