The growing unrest that followed this destruction provided the extremists with an opportunity to attack and pillage the shanty- towns of the minority Muslim population in a clear case of land grab in Mumbai. Overnight slum colonies were burnt to cinders. The railway stations were filled with Muslims trying to catch any train that might take them away to the safety of their villages.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hamletmachine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
