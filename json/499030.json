In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a martial art developed from Judo, which focuses on grappling and ground fighting, positions of dominance and weakness form a dynamic structure in which physical strength is not a decisive criterion. Power structures are translated into a sporting struggle with an open output, in which the roles of domination and submission are reversed from one moment to the next. Shot primarily in slow motion, the competitive nature of the jiu-jitsu fighters and racehorses is paralysed by an extreme aestheticization, transforming scenes of action into objects of contemplation and visual pleasure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tuesday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
