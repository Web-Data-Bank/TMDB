They hear rumors that a Russian ship with a festival talent scout will be arriving in the port of Constanta. The band sets up for a performance at the harbor, in hopes of attracting the scout’s attention immediately upon arrival. A case of mistaken identity leads to a series of complications involving a suitcase, two small-time gangsters, a blonde tourist, and the band’s drummer. This attempt at a plot conforms of course to the conventions of romantic musical comedies, resulting in a film full of song and dance.  With memorable song titles like “Yes, I am an umbrella” and “Let’s play my guitar”, this Romanian-Soviet co-production is as silly as it is irresistible.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/lqjMmvP7HJEBVD8R5GWswJmi7xk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1971-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Songs of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
