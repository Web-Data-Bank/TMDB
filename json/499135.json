Clara and George Kessler, the father-and-daughter detective team leading the inquiry, are certain the crime is connected to the war being waged between livestock farmers and environmentalists ever since wolves were reintroduced into the valley. Among locals, far-fetched theories are stirring panic-could a werewolf be terrorizing the valley? For the Kesslers, the murder will uncover a secret that may not be supernatural, but is just as shocking.","popularity":1.913,"poster_path":"/lEg9OzLrNhyUNtWNXZIr0anldsL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murders in Savoie","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":9}
