This inquisitive cross between a documentary and a theatre piece was created by Tilda Cobham-Hervey and twelve 12-year-old girls, where real girls articulate what they hope for, what they remember and what it feels like to be twelve. Performing themselves in a filmed field guide, together these specimens investigate their own species.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Rw11hnQsAyCa2URMuypzqioi8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48685,"logo_path":"/k9PjFljaVnF7j5RpxWjdohWW8uH.png","name":"Closer Productions","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"WHAT A TWELVIE!","title":"A Field Guide to Being a 12-Year-Old Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
