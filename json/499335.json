Often a burning candle illuminates the colourful interior. Most of them are erected to the memory of a beloved, killed in a car accident, others because someone has been miraculously saved. They are the evidence of a daily devotion and are called 'proskynitaria' or 'ikonismata'.  The older ones many have been built becuase somebody had a significant dream on the spot, or to indicate the place of a former church or perhaps to protect the entrance of a house against ill luck.  Each 'proskynitari' has its own story. This documentary tells us some of these stories and shows an importnat aspect of how the Greek people deal with death and what role religion plays in everyday life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hj4vnd5pIXaxTVjykgtCJPuFGjJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whether or not you believe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
