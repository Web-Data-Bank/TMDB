Despite discouragement from her family, Walaa applies - and gets in. But her own rebellious behavior and a complicated relationship with her mother are a challenge, as are the circumstances under which she  lives. Following Walaa from 15 to 21, this first-ever look inside the Palestinian police academy brings us the story of a young woman navigating formidable obstacles, learning which rules to break and follow, and disproving the negative predictions from her surroundings and the world at large.","popularity":0.807,"poster_path":"/5SiXqObK18iVPVSxFOTJCElODwh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94525,"logo_path":"/qxEhxuaApqR7GaYMJ5eyfKgQofd.png","name":"Wildling Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Walaa Wants","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
