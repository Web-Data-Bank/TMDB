A fortune teller advises the Mandalay businessman, whose car and bulging wallet suggest that business is going pretty well, to spend 14 days in a monastery, living life as a monk and eating an apple a day. Such a thing is possible in Burma today. Wang Shin-hong arrives at the rural monastery, has his head shaved and dons a red robe, in which he instantly becomes an authority. During the welcome procession, the village women, their poverty clear from their clothing and the huts in the background, put more than they have in his alms bowl. During his fleeting role as their advisor, Wang Shin-hong soon learns of the villagers’ attempts to survive and make a living as legal or illegal migrants in China, Thailand or Malaysia. He also finds out how the other monks try to generate profit and additional income.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/3DCU1UD39q7jq5AMg1v5G6RBjWd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taiwan Public Television Service Foundation","origin_country":"TW"},{"id":97323,"logo_path":null,"name":"Myanmar Montage Films","origin_country":""},{"id":45557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seashore Image Production","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2018-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"14 Apples","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
