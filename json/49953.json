Born on a Baja, California beach in 1959, new hatchling Sammy must do what his fellow newborn sea turtles are doing: race across the beach to the ocean before they are captured by a seagull or crab. Thus begins Sammy's incredible fifty-year ocean journey. Along the way he meets his best friend, a fellow turtle named Ray, and overcomes obstacles both natural and man-made while trying to fulfill his dream of travelling around the world. Throughout his voyage, Sammy never forgets about Shelly - the turtle he saved on his first day and loves passionately from afar.","popularity":16.229,"poster_path":"/n2lKNUSAgeZDDPcWHGUnRU89YkF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Investment Group","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":10159,"logo_path":null,"name":"nWave Pictures","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":10160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illuminata Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-08-03","revenue":71594792,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hatch Me If You Can","title":"A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures","video":false,"vote_average":5.999,"vote_count":571}
