Illustrated with hundreds of up-to-date images, Dreamworlds 3 offers a unique and powerful tool for understanding both the continuing influence of music videos and how pop culture more generally filters the identities of young men and women through a dangerously narrow set of myths about sexuality and gender. In doing so, it inspires viewers to reflect critically on images that they might otherwise take for granted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kVU3jJokFIfIloeAXYJmbz0lYsv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreamworlds 3: Desire, Sex, and Power in Music Video","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
