As we sought a solution, we began documenting our journey as a way of reflecting and coping, and we were overwhelmed by the physical, emotional, and financial cost of creating a baby.  We filmed all important events, decisions, and results in real time, exposing the heartbreaking, challenging, and even hilarious roller-coaster ride undertaken by a couple struggling to build a family.Throughout our journey, we have interviewed many other couples who have experienced the same struggle and found alternative ways to construct their families. Through IVF, surrogacy, egg and sperm donation, adoption, and miraculous natural conceptions, these infertility “survivors” instill a sense of hope that creating a family when all hope seems lost is possible.","popularity":0.705,"poster_path":"/w9e6wDjPveQG0H1ykZVCq5EvhYG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One More Shot","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
