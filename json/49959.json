They're to play in Paris at Charles's school reunion. In getting to Paris and back, the characters interact with Aimee's ex-husband and her abrasive, cruel ex-mentor, Louise's would-be lover who turns out to have a husband, Mickey's long-time lover and her children, Bertrand's Germanic wife and their children who speak no French, and Frederic's distant mother. The band also meets Clara, a mercurial free spirit who beguiles Bertrand, then Mickey, then takes up with someone else in the band.","popularity":2.103,"poster_path":"/ji7iO9WqwcJQkStPekYCu1adw5H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Marcel Dassault","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaumont International","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1981-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clara and Chics Types","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":28}
