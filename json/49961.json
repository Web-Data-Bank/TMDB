In fact, he devotes himself to a bohemian life, preferring the popular fairs and pretty women, especially Alice, a seamstress from the Castelinhos quarter, which rather upsets her ambitious father, tailor Caetano, who is familiar with Vasco's debts. After failing yet another final exam, he is surprised by his aunts' announcement that they will visit him in Lisbon to see his practice.","popularity":1.602,"poster_path":"/pBaaNgZU89MRYsl6POuqzFhCYOm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis Portuguesa","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1933-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Song of Lisbon","video":false,"vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":35}
