He was 21 years old. This incident marks the starting point for Abaturov’s reflection on the military. He films the training of new recruits in Siberia, as they bid farewell to their mothers and girlfriends, learn the mechanics of a Kalashnikov, or how to throw a hand grenade and administer first aid. While his parents try to cope with their loss, Dima’s former fellow recruits have to return to battle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e1hJyC9skeMrxtSkXMTvxidsTf4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84956,"logo_path":"/xgJpzbQBGZtLCVl19DL4WbSnS7Y.png","name":"Petit à Petit Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":109628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibériade","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Son","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":8}
