This law of impunity prevented the clarification demanded by the relatives of those who had disappeared and been murdered by the former regime. A public initiative arose calling for a referendum in which the law be subject to the vote of the people. Unas preguntas uses U-matic footage, mostly of interviews recorded on the streets of Uruguay between 1987 and 1989, to present a time capsule of the period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ykCacHkd4r1xegL7Jv9H29BvrNK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weltfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":237,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One or Two Questions","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
