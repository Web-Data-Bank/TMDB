Images of frames and framed materials recur. Pages of a dictionary flip by, and it is here that the viewer can see a reference to Will Hindle. Entry words echo his film titles - Billabong, Chinese Firedrill etc. A soft-focus female nude, reminiscent of an Edward Weston photograph, becomes increasingly scratched as the footage runs, a memento mori of the plastic material itself. Much, the film tells us, is beautiful, and much will be forgotten.” (Tom Whiteside)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n0CjXvMVGhv6eqrMdr6T88BuchN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Handed Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
