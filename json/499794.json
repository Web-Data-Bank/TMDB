Gracia follows Los Fiambres vocalist Rober Perdut more than thirty years later. He meets a photographer for a photo session in a bus station, is looking for drugs and loses someone named Roni (Rober’s surname does not coincidentally mean ‘disappeared, lost’). Rober sniffs coke from a Johnny Cash CD and is sailed to an island. In other scenes, we follow the photographer, who sometimes disappears mysteriously.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/3DiPH9kz09D2kVACyAoUzXNchJ7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54807,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Viaje Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":13853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeitun Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":129887,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Horlá producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wandering Star","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
