The Sleigh Ride","overview":"Filmed in Karasjok, Norway - 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, BBC Four rigs a traditional reindeer sleigh with a fixed camera for a magical journey across the frozen wilderness of the Arctic. Following the path of an ancient postal route, the ride captures the traditional world of the Sami people who are indigenous to northern Scandinavia and for whom reindeer herding remains a way of life.  Deliberately unhurried, the rhythmic pace of the reindeer guides us along an epic two-hour trip that takes us over undulating snowy hills, through birch forests, across a frozen lake and past traditional Sami settlements.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/caolF7xBJX7Qyca4FbyhL1oZeeM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44577,"logo_path":"/oGw6GC8PmseJtYed3POxDiO1j0p.png","name":"The Garden Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"All Aboard!
