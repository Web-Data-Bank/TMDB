The photo transports us into her life. She is eight years old and is about to lose her best friend, a boy from a wealthy family who is moving to America. Back in the Netherlands, the photographer is confronted with his own constant loneliness. The photo of the girl evokes memories of his own childhood, when he still felt at home somewhere.","popularity":1.589,"poster_path":"/a0dSzFEDJEeQwK8QNl7dyOOUEXn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2345,"logo_path":"/nozBgqHmM9A22IHkghTnLiUrM7Q.png","name":"Lemming Film","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":29736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nukleus Film","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":86711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flash Forward Entertainment","origin_country":"TW"},{"id":109924,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jaako dobra produkcija","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2018-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Impossibly Small Object","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
