Through steady practice under the wildest of conditions, Roman (12, trumpet), Polina (10, trombone, drums and many other instruments), Nikita (12, drums) and Nikita (14, piano) produce magical music with ancient, wobbly instruments. Not least due to their wit and good humor, they persevere together, helped along by their 80+-year-old conductor and a young teacher. These children of the post-Soviet provinces use American tunes to achieve their dream – to become someone in the world and make something of their lives, no matter how dire the circumstances. From the authors of an awards winning documentary film Ukrainian Sheriffs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/adUeKEGzosYenKlA8kkq1SPZqZA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saxonia Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":99903,"logo_path":null,"name":"AVANTIS","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2015-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the saits come marching intoadult life","title":"Dixieland: Little Kids Big Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
