Ominous cranes overlook Natasha's land at the edge of Kiev, which year after year is being pushed deeper into a pit by new panel buildings. The brave owner protects not only acres of land, but also traditional family values, faith and ownership. From a bird's-eye view of the farm, a sharp contrast emerges between the village and the city. This peculiar family business model is set forth in a four-year chronicle from the point of view of foreign visitors who don't interfere with the way of life that the family has lived for generations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n2kDjezuGkxEn1dolpf3qYgNi05.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":20810,"logo_path":"/hBLCynl7e2l2w4Ro6SnS1a2FrME.png","name":"Nutprodukce","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2014-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
