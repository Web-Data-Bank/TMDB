David Perlov's camera travels over photographs, focuses on faces\r that are no more, as in a gesture of parting. The history of the Holocaust\r is revealed in this film in a condensed, intensive way: first the memorials\r for the victims throughout Israel, and only then the beginning of it all - the\r rise of the Nazi regime, the Ghetto with its hunger and death, but with its\r music and theatre too, the uprising, the death camps; and it ends with the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the chief architects of the genocide.\r The music of Oedoen Partos, blending Jewish, Israeli and European motives,\r helps portray in sounds that lost world which now belongs to memory alone","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Thy Blood Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
