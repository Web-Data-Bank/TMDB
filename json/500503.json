In August of 1963, groups from all over the country journeyed to Washington D.C. for a massive demonstration, and this film is a fascinating document of this event. Celebrated filmmaker Haskell Wexler (\"Medium Cool\") traveled with the San Francisco delegation, photographing and conversing candidly with the participants.
