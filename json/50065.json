Dara is on top form as he effortlessly mixes off the cuff audience interaction with razor sharp material and a star studded finale that almost puts Hollywood to shame. \"O Briain is loud and large and fast and feisty...............but the way he tells 'em is a joy\" - The Times \"O Briain has a laser eye for the absurd and the spurious amid the too-much-stuff with which we shore up our hapless lives\" - The Guardian \"Breakneck genius...... the entire audience was hanging on every sentence. And every sentence ended in a laugh. It was stuffed with dazzling observations, vivid vignettes and glorious gags.\" Evening Standard","popularity":1.776,"poster_path":"/rpMkoLBylSL0kmKx8JLDOkyYRBl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Mike Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dara Ó Briain: This Is the Show","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":18}
