Both consider themselves to be writers, but success has so far eluded them. The fact that Wu is supported by a divorced, elderly man helps the women through lean periods.

The situation escalates when both Wu and her mother hit an emotional low.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pcDo7X14ivLfPicT1p3in7wcLi2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2018-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girls Always Happy","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
