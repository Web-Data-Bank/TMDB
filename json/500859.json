Soaking up its bustling metropolises and tranquil countryside, Allah introduces us to a succession of vividly rendered souls who call this island home. Their candid testimonies create a polyphonic symphony, set against a visual prayer of indelible portraiture. Thoroughly immersed between the sacred and profane, BLACK MOTHER channels rebellion and reverence into a deeply personal ode informed by Jamaicaâ€™s turbulent history but existing in the urgent present.","popularity":2.519,"poster_path":"/6lD2qZWM7CKxlcme6YDmdXJw4UV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12219,"logo_path":"/cU5xtXF1NbOEdtwQNJTGC1IlHBS.png","name":"Cinereach","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JM","name":"Jamaica"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Mother","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":15}
