On the bus to Buenos Aires he meets Fernando (Alberto Segado), a gay businessman, who invites Nahuel to his home. Fernando's dissolute lifestyle of costume parties and heavy drinking begins to seem more and more empty and frivolous as he identifies with Nahuel's quest to overcome beaurocracy and indifference. Occasionally funny and ultimately heartbreaking.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ibJU3KkTVC2Rk3WdA1MeitGckIB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El largo viaje de Nahuel Pan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
