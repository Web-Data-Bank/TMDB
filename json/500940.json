She tries to establish a rhythm through every day routines such as eating, sleeping and washing. We see one of here childhood memories-an Alsatian dog licks a girl's heel and rests its head between her legs- and a dream, in which she is standing naked I a pit which could be a grave. In addition we see a magnified symbolic version of her surroundings, particularly of insects. Shots of windows, doors and mirrors convey a sense of menace and introspection. Thanks to measured performance by Marion van Wijk, superb lighting, black and white photography and well balanced editing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
