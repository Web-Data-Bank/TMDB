Whether you're completely new to the market or a veteran trader, there's something in this DVD for everyone.

Each chapter teaches a different setup that I play, including a grand total of 35 live trade examples! Experience my strategy as if you were sitting next to me watching me trade, listening to my every thought. You will see my entries, my exits, my successes, and my failures. But, most importantly, you will see WHY I make the trading decisions that I do.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w7mbxqYxdtU4mAw1SUtUD3yV3gg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":241,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Trading Tickers - Tim Grittani","title":"Trading Tickers: The long and the short of it - Disc 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
