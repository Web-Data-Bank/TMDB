Just before its fall, Milad Amin, residing in Beirut, follows up with his friend Ghith, an activist and photographer, who like so many other civilians still remains in the besieged city. Following Ghith via his camera through the ruins of the city, we hear the two friends talk about people’s situations while waiting for their fate amidst the fighting parties. The film is an intimate and personal recording of civilians’ sufferings during this time of siege, hunger, and war – and a recording of both the relationship of activists brought together during the civil movements and of the geographic distances that separate them due to violence, bombing, and killing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/11kc2MGgBU8LPf1ozu6smcieNT0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2018-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Doom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
