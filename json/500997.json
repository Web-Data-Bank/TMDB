It's a film essay about the artist’s work, rather than a documentary about his life. An unmediated vision of Jack Smith, an invitation to join him in his lost paradise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vOfgtooduV6cLYz3tsp9z3Glghy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escape From Rented Island: The Lost Paradise of Jack Smith","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
