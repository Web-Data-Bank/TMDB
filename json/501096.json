The sketches this time include a send-up of The Fugitive — Richard Kimble is now a veterinarian on the lam. Despite the danger, he must intervene whenever he sees a cat (always Michael) suffering; after treating the patient, he plays a trick on the cat and runs away. Another sketch draws parallels between wandering husbands and wandering house cats, who seem to have similar proclivities. Two more point out what happens when a cat's instincts run up against the requirements of baseball or pro wrestling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1s0MZIOCywW1l5VInjfL9Mb5Ruw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kitty Films","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1988-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's Michael? 2","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
