Turgidity was filmed at an automotive testing facility during the making of one of his sculptures, which involves crashing a car into a steel pole. The video shows nearly four seconds of high-resolution footage from the crash, gradually slowed to a halt, and then reversed. The result is a mesmerizing slow-motion depiction of the car's destruction and the sculpture's creation. The soundtrack includes audio from the impact, as well as of the artist's heartbeat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turgidity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
