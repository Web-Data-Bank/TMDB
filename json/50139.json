However, he is a lot more hard-working than all the others as he wants to get away from this besieged city. Apart from his study, he is indifferent to everything because he comes from a defunct family. Having to take care of his mentally-ill mother, Ling Kit is also forced to face his Dad – a heavy drunker and a heavy gambler. His younger brother Chun-Kit has left the family for years. At that time, Chun-Kit was heavily bullied by his classmates in school and he was always beaten by his drunken father. Being the elder brother, however, Ling-Kit did not protect Chun-Kit from being beaten so Chun-Kit left in great panic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oItfP5tdCwH5HrydEQZPbgwD6MY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3615,"logo_path":null,"name":"BIG Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2008-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Besieged City","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
