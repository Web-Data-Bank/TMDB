Hearing a strong typhoon might strike, everyone has escaped the disaster. She checks her school, but no one is there. She meets her classmate, Fujii, unexpectedly. Fujii asks Mado to find a shelter together. He doesn't want to leave her alone. Both start looking around to see if anyone's left behind: An empty theatre, a movie is still running on the screen. A young girl stands by a desolated pool. A strip show theater with a retired stripper. An old man brushes his shoe in a bowling center continuously. Both guys search everywhere. And finally in the heavy rain, they find shelter in a factory. This is a factory where Mado's father had died in.","popularity":0.807,"poster_path":"/s0CO0xgQ3bLPNgZX2wP9M9vOrSF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53391,"logo_path":"/7aPeLmQjH1EFhqAXWLyyxZ535QA.png","name":"Tokyo University of the Arts","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2015-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Light in the Distance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
