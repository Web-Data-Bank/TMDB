Cork, an innocent bird-like creature, in a militaristic world that is dominated by high fasion and flashy billboards is befriended by the not too trustworthy bad boy named Vouku. Vouku’s tendency toward violent entertainment and vehicular homicide only serve to increase Cork’s angst. After a trip to the game their attitudes are changed by a vision of angels dancing at a ho-down on the head of a needle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/noxeYYy9HjQSOXDrNu5z7azKYow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tugging the Worm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
