In the spring of 2008, a group of climbers traveled there to investigate for themselves an area surrounding a village called Herakleia, on the shores of Bafa Lake in southwest Turkey. Nestled among 3000 year old ruins, meadows of flowers and olive trees lies what may be one of the greatest and largest undeveloped climbing areas on Earth. Join Jon Cardwell, Lauren Lee, Isaac Caldiero, Serkan Eroan, and more as they uncover the treasures of Herakleia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aq42g80xsPdmnMFmqfrcXMUAHjw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Momentum Media","origin_country":""},{"id":623,"logo_path":null,"name":"MC Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Monsters do exist","title":"Herakleia","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
