Narcissus becomes a metaphor for a society which has not resolved its colonial history, taking itself and its own image as the only objects of love. How do we break out of this colonial, patriarchal mould?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sXTS1Y5KsvnMZKgkm5X0obSXIHm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Illusions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
