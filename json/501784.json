With his short frame and at almost 50, Alain is a physical phenomenon capable of hoisting his body with only one finger despite a major disability due to a fall in 1982. Paradoxically, it is after that accident that he developed his style of climbing using only his bare hands and without any security.  Today, with more than 100 towers climbed, as many arrests and several stays in prison, Alain is a legend. But who’s the man behind the climber? What motivates him? Find out in this portrait full of breathtaking footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iHEm0SCaRptyvIppfug4rIzCLNW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Absynthe Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Legend of the Spider-Man","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
