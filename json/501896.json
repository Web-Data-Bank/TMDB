Voices of longtime residents of Los Sures, a mostly Puerto Rican neighborhood, are juxtaposed with images suggesting a recently disappearing past. The film weaves their stories, reflecting unique glimpses into collective memory of a place undergoing rapid changes. Through explorations of urban space, the film unearths fragments of history and culture, and recreates those memories through video, photography, archival documents and animation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":100319,"logo_path":null,"name":"UnionDocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Memory & Los Sures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
