Slippery ways of life appear and disappear, bringing us into contact with some evasive characters. Characters who trade in scrap, steal, gamble, and hang around jails, disused factories and fairgrounds. Characters who have enough time on their hands to pose for a long while in front of a pinhole camera, but are incapable of being still, so their image is always blurred.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/enrnF63zc07sjixS3nANTTCos7a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2002-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moby Dick","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
