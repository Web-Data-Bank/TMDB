It opens with the excerpt from No President originally called \"Marsh Gas of Flatulandia\" - several minutes of black and white footage of steam escaping from manholes segues to an interior scene of various creatures emerging from dry ice vapors - then shifts to show the filmmaker, clad in a leopard skin jump suit, attended by a nurse as he sits amidst the detritus of his duplex loft. A fan presents him with a black-and-white glamour shot to autograph as Ondine, dressed entirely in black leather, snaps his picture. Violence erupts as the nurse takes out a whip to discipline the star's fans. When a female creature pulls out the same dagger depicted in the glamour shot, Smith jumps up and shakes the weapon from her hand. The action is post-scripted with footage of a steam shovel patrolling the rubble where the Broadway Central hotel once stood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q7Tkdrf1TuI0Wzlp4SQEDHuioSW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was A Male Yvonne De Carlo For The Lucky Landlord.....","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
