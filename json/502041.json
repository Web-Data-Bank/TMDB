Images of the sea ravishing the shore – small cliffs of sand eroding and collapsing – are inter-cut with extreme close-ups of text and the texture of the page and book itself being flooded with ocean waves.  In scene after scene the reader attempts to re-enter the book only to find himself a part of intense dreams and hallucinations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qK6cZHvFALhqzobHq2C18sQ9TyT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Arts Intermix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incidence of Catastrophe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
