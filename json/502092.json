We isolated the shots in which no character is talking: the quiet lulls in the stormy debate and the wordless reaction shots. We fashioned these silent shots into a six minute montage, adding only music and non-verbal sounds from the film. No dialogue. (Well, almost none. Youâ€™ll hear).  Is the story arc still comprehensible? Can you still sense the tension and the power struggles between the twelve jurors? Judge for yourself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7ODpxEhUm1N5bS6B8OASOFZug8j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"12 Silent Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
