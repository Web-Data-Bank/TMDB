Three soldiers on very short home leave visit Berlin. One isn't from there and runs around with his guide book being perplexed by all the things that are different now. Another visits his wife and his baby. And the third enters a romance due to a mistaken identity which at the end provides a tiny bit of drama in a film which otherwise bends over to show how happy the home front is and supportive of its soldiers.  Some nice location shooting, but neither story nor stars amount to much.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/8fcb1q25C4fjE4d59NQTHFMccKj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1944-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein schöner Tag","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
