Mt. Evans is  a world renowned bouldering destination and the newest development has been at Lincoln Lake  near the summit of the 14,000ft Mountain. Chapter 1: our heroes brave the rugged tundra of Mt. Evans to clash heatedly with the most inspiring blocks of granite they can find. Unbeknownst to them, large, ill-spirited residents of the lake lurk nearby. Chapter 2: our heroes seek boulders to conquer, mauling their skin and spilling blood on the way to their noble achievements!  Chapter 3 portrays our heroes slaying yet more classic boulders! Sadly, the slayers become the slain, as a Giant begins terrorizing them. Much blood is shed from our heroes’ toned bodies. Their deaths arrive awash in honor, ridden with glory. In Chapter 4, our two remaining climbers experience a massive resurgence of psych, even in the wake of their friends’ atrocious murders. The surrounding boulders are simply too enticing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3IhTOobisIm23OdQp6nCv8AbF8B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Louder Than Eleven","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lincoln Lake Giants","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
