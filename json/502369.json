He was stopped and eventually sent to a psychiatric hospital for two years. Thanks to international pressure from the mathematical community in 1972 he was allowed to emigrate to Israel.  Now he is considered one of the most brilliant mathematicians in the world. At the same time, for most people familiar with his name, Rips is first of all associated with the development of the so called Bible Code – a mathematical program allegedly helping to decipher hidden messages encoded in Torah – the Five Books of Moses. He is attacked by both the scientific and religious community, yet his research continues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jY8wsWL8VL2ZG1la5JRHAxKa393.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Angels Studio","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eliyahu Rips: The Burning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
