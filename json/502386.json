It is a huge land covered with ice as thick as three miles, seemingly invulnerable, cold and dark for eight months of the year. Yet Antarctica is also a fragile place, home to an incredible variety of life along its edges, arguably the most stunning, breathtaking and still-pristine place on earth. The one constant is that it is constantly changing, every season, every day, every hour. I've been fortunate to travel to Antarctica many times; most recently with 3D cameras, a first for the continent. The result is our new film, Antarctica: On the Edge.","popularity":0.923,"poster_path":"/8FPap12NOMDP15isJ03XOt0GdE6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oceans 8 Films","origin_country":""},{"id":135486,"logo_path":null,"name":"DQBD Films","origin_country":""},{"id":5576,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giant Screen Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":135487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afterglow Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Antarctica 3D: On the Edge","title":"Antarctica: On the Edge","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
