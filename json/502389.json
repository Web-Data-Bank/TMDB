With their slinky and extremely danceable rhythms and passionate concert performances, the outfit has long been one of reggae's top live acts. Released in 2001, the Live DVD is a fine document of the latter-day Toots & the Maytals live experience, recorded in front of a large and receptive crowed at the Santa Monica Pier in California on August 7, 1997. Featuring ten tracks overall and clocking in at an hour, Live features stirring renditions of many of the group's best-known tracks, including such highlights as \"Pomps and Pride,\" \"Funky Kingston,\" \"Monkey Man,\" and \"54-46 Was My Number,\" among others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2YmJlXA9W2AFiLXmZcQoTc3s9Xa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mvd Visual","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live at Santa Monica Pier","title":"Toots & The Maytals: Live at Santa Monica Pier","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
