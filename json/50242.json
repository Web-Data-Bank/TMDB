With a vintage Polaroid camera in hand, he takes to the New York streets, stopping occasionally at tourist attractions and coffee shops. Along the way, he unexpectedly meets a distraught woman who left her boyfriend that very morning after discovering that he had been unfaithful. Like Sidney, she too is drifting around Manhattan, as she waits for a flight to take her back to San Francisco.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dmMw5KKcPtOzQISsL8OEUch8tXY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New York Waiting","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6}
