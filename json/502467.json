Matt bakes for his Boss, nightclub owner Frank, and occasionally works as a lookout on the street. Roxy is a prostitute who does a runner after a business disagreement. Boss wants her found and sends Rick, his right hand man, to do the searching with henchmen Aristotle and Max in tow. None of the lookouts have seen her, it's as if she's vanished. Everyone's looking for Roxy whilst Matt keeps his head down and Roxy hidden in his flat.","popularity":0.903,"poster_path":"/acRX5GnLVUQvxKEMSANgX8i5bmT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Too Right Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life costs and there's still a little owing.","title":"The Cake Maker","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
