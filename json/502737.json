The three are the mistress of the house and her servants, and the film is clearly based on Les Bonnes by Genet. The servants pretend to unite to varying degrees against their mistress, and she, in turn, pretends to be a mistress who doesn't give explicit orders but who makes herself admired anyway. Each one of them plays the part that is most congenial to her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143518,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lontane Province Film","origin_country":""},{"id":56023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poetiche Cinematografiche","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2003-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mistress and Maid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
