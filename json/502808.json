Might Mother Nature fix this by creating a tribe on a nearby island where all the men are hunks, and the women are brutes? You’d think not, but the makers of Wild Women of Wongo are not you. Wild Women of Wongo is a sex farce without the sex or the farce, set in a never-never land of uncivilized island dwellers who all look like someone going to a Halloween party as “uncivilized island dweller.”  Add a crocodile who comes in the form of stock footage and rubber model, a lot of awkward dancing, and an actress named “Adrienne Bourbeau” who refuses to actually be Adrienne Barbeau, and you got yourself a movie. Mike, Kevin and Bill will DANCE their way into your hearts with this riff.","popularity":0.832,"poster_path":"/xWYJAc4GD2WVnKqffAh9ZKEnLtG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Even the birds and bees are confused...","title":"The Film Crew: Wild Women of Wongo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
