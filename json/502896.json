In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin and the blockchain. For the first time in history, his invention made it possible to send money around the globe without banks, governments or any other intermediaries. Satoshi is a mystery character, and just like the Wright brothers, he solved an unsolvable problem. The concept of the blockchain isn't very intuitive. But still, many people believe it is a game changer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jfpLHAWm7EgS6xl1KLsjn6arPDt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blockchain and Us","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
