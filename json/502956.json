Children often shout at him in the street, and he has even received death threats to his own doorstep. But Charles, who has a gentle disposition, won’t let these adversities discourage him. He has decided to survive, and he is proud of his children who are growing up as Finns. He is also proud of his job: “It felt good when I got my first salary. By paying taxes I can give something back for the good things Finland has given me.”  Charles was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but the bloody tribal wars that broke out in the beginning of the 90s drove the country’s Tutsi population either to their deaths or into exile into the neighbouring country, Rwanda. In the documentary we follow Charles as he travels to Rwanda to meet friends and family. However, the reunion is not all pleasant: his mother lives in a gloomy refugee camp.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tEbd86fKNFUM2VFn0OREh1t3D5b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Road Home","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
