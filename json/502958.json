They had promised each other that they would build a retreat in Shiguretei, but Ushio was hospitalized after a stroke a few days later, and when his wife, Takako, rushed to the hospital, she discovered their love affair, which in reality had not gone beyond kissing. Now, 20 years later, against the advice of her ikebana mentor, Tae rushes to meet Ushio at Shiguretei, only to see him clutching his chest in pain. Eventually, the design and plans for the dream retreat are seen by Tae, but she has to visit Kyoto alone... or maybe she's heading for somewhere else.","popularity":1.241,"poster_path":"/rF1QCsqj7epf9SZoCn0lwakSiZK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9221,"logo_path":"/7hEAueutGnsQUyUGnp5zQ1YmCrO.png","name":"Toei Video Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":44262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Arts","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3341,"logo_path":"/dTG5dXE1kU2mpmL9BNnraffckLU.png","name":"Fuji Television Network","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary of Early Winter Shower","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
