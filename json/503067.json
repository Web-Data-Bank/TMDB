Led by a spiritual guide and a whip-bearing ringleader, a group of dancers ride woven horses in rhythmic unison until they are entered by spirits. Once possessed they engage in a range of self-mortification behaviors until safely emerging from their altered state, left with no memory of the event and no lingering ill effects.  The film combines footage of a number of Jathilan performances with interviews with dancers, spiritual leaders, anthropologists, and enthusiasts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mScBuqjfPYbchuBOHJ4QDkv9UGd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"java music, trance, ethnomusicology, anthropology, tradition and rituals","title":"Jathilan: Trance and Possession in Java","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
