Were it possible to freeze into a solid the sum of all the images, the screen would be seen as a limitless freezer of frames. Even more so, when the screen is a screen of a screenâ€”a condition approaching the simultaneity of electronics. The usual battery of devices: Super-8, 16mm and slide projectors. A constructed series of film loops with scenes of [everyday] life, slowing down and accelerating the events on a solitary screen, so that life as it has been staged gathers itself up in a perpetual serial [process of] self-editing. On the tv screen a face is pierced through by the small filmic screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j0ASMpIIiU3uSZfmEfLipsrchfe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Screen, Just the Screen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
