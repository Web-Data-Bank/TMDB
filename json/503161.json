Their narratives are connected by the enduring thread of the ancient art of embroidery.  Twelve resilient, determined and articulate women from disparate walks of life: lawyers, artists, housewives, activists, architects, and politicians stitch together the story of their homeland, of their dispossession, and of their unwavering determination that justice will prevail.  Through their stories, the individual weaves into the collective, yet remaining distinctly personal.  Twelve women, twelve life-spans, and stories from Palestine; a land whose position was fixed on the map of the world, but is now embroidered on its face.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n9FVqEPmD0eIeKWRvoNWcMFwLOb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forward Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2017-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stitching Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
