Most people think that multiculturalism is a well entrenched principle in this country. Yet, at the first sign of disquiet in any part of the world, Canada's Multiculturalism policy is called into question. This hot-button issue is confronted head-on in this riveting documentary. The film records the history of various immigrant groups who are not officially recognized in history books. Can the word 'diversity' replace 'multiculturalism'? Is it just a word or a principle which determines how Canadians relate to one another?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The M Word","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
