Since the evenings were so empty, Jane Elford, the star, urged me to get started making another movie (we had completed PAGAN RHAPSODY the year before). I said \"okay,\" and launched her in a photographed series of telephone calls, not really knowing who was going to be on the other end. I was interested at the time in irrational, neurotic responses and so the heroine was put into unstable situations that I dreamt up because I was making a movie with a plot and there should be some action .... Many of the stars appear nude and all I can say is that because of the heat and the general, overall feeling of the film which is one of the usual desperation and explosive emotions, I couldn't see any other way of them playing it. The general tone of everything was ... \"Why even bother to get dressed?\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pIaT77YH3ARiGZtA4rHlynLQuv6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Ramona","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
