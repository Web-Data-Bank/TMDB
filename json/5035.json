Always in motion, Augustin wanders three times. First, as a youth, while a boarder near Bourges, he's lost in the woods and finds a chateau where an engagement party's in progress: there he falls eternally in love with Yvonne and she with him. Back at school, he hears she is in Paris, so he follows in a vain search and meets a woman, jilted by her lover. In the countryside a few year's later, Augustin's friend François finds Yvonne and brings Augustin to her. They marry, but the next day, Augustin leaves to fulfill a youthful promise he made to Yvonne's brother. François comforts the pregnant Yvonne as they await Augustin's return.","popularity":0.894,"poster_path":"/pZBDMPskQ5VHoic7m0QafVBEdPn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Consortium Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":422,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sirius Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":1147,"logo_path":"/tBDaGOA04LmlsbLvMwHjR7WzT9H.png","name":"Madeleine Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":59942,"logo_path":null,"name":"AWA Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1967-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wanderer","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":11}
