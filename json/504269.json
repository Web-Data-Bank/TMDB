Structurally it is a journey from the forests of northern Saskatchewan to the Badlands in the south. It is the final part in a series of North American landscape films and videos that I have been shooting for the past few years. Caribou is essentially a video about mortality, death, decay, notions of beauty, and a respect for the natural world. It is grounded in the detail of our surroundings, and the beauty that resonates from these hidden places.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8EFLoETWOAGY9uUoj04gPh3JDvr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caribou","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
