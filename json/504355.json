The wonderful thing about this creative product of the combined wills and imaginations of Anais and Billy Yeager is how profoundly it succeeds in quietly crystalizing an alternative reality in the here and now.Their language of innocent play underpinned with a dystopian despair - a sustained dialogue between the sensual pleasures of simple existence and the sense of aimlessness and utter loss that naturally grow out of what George Gurdjieff called “the terror of our situation” - evokes a mood of homelessness tinged with a sweet optimism reminiscent of the 1960s.  This is creating nostalgia in the present, bringing a feeling of remembering to the moment, making something out of nothing. And such, these two make me realize, is life.
