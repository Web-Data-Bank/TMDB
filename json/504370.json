After getting her heart crushed in a relationship, a woman writes a letter to the man she loves for a simple reason—to evoke his empathy towards her. Knowing the premise of human emotions, the woman starts her letter with her own life stories, follows with a blunt confession of affection, and ends with a cursing when she can’t handle the emotions anymore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wZ1mDrAa8zH8SP1OlmuCxsw3tpu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EMPATHY (a digital love letter)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
