She feels even more alone this Christmas as she searches fruitlessly for a job. The seasonal cheer around her only rubs salt in her wounds as she scrapes by to support herself and her dog, Dash. But her neighbor, Nick, knows exactly what to do. He offers her a job, to be his assistant in the best work-helping others. There's one catch that Ashley must honor though-she can't tell anyone that her new boss is a sort of Secret Santa, helping others anonymously. Through her new job, Ashley meets Will, a writer for a business magazine who uncovers what Ashley is doing, and more importantly, Nick's involvement. As Ashley and Nick help people in need, Ashley tries to protect Nick's secret, and her own heart, while Will must weigh the consequences of what he does.","popularity":3.397,"poster_path":"/c1HZZB7ZWHWyEryKJgoT3rRFfCb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145549,"logo_path":"/4wMX7xT85Wr0VqrMqAkRQkxfpKg.png","name":"SunWorld Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":49924,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silver Peak Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Miracles are all around you.","title":"Christmas Angel","video":false,"vote_average":7.125,"vote_count":32}
