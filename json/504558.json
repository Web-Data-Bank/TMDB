What you see in this film is documentary-like scenes shot with a simple video camera in Moscow and Budapest, and New York, and these scenes are linked to the novel by some explicit links, and by these, the film goes beyond the level of being but a visual documentary which would only have reminded the viewer of The Master and Margarita.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/fnrqjoXidrGdVSRKt7CQGTJNmcZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After The Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
