The resulting conflicts between the hitchhiker, who respects no rules or boundaries, and the family, provide the substance for most of the humor in this sincere but not especially well-thought-out film. Reviewers who saw the film at the 1967 Mannheim Film Festival expressed the opinion that it was an unformed work by a promising talent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1xyzSnHHdg4R7xCeVX6Td0iGSlT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Whipping Cream Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
