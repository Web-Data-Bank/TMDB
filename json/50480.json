Thirty minutes of non-stop road-building action, from the surveyors staking out the job site to the first car traveling down the finished highway. A friendly host named George, entertains and educates kids as they watch real construction workers, the heavy machinery, blasting equipment and the tools used in every step of a road-building project. This video has become a classic, and was ranked in the top-ten best videos in Parent's Magazines' Guide To The Best Family Videos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/688DhjgAsbIZYb4KIEQtnhWN195.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fred Levine Productions/Little Hardhats","origin_country":""},{"id":136138,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tapeworm Video Distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road Construction Ahead","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
