The film was edited in camera and shot from one camera position in the middle of one of the 112 football pitches that cover Hackney Marsh, a location chosen because of the similarities between the surrounding buildings and objects (identical blocks of flats, goalposts etc.). By cutting between precisely matched framings of similar objects, illusions of movement were produced, disrupting representational readings of the landscape. Unforeseen events occurring in the vicinity were also recorded, determining to some extent the subsequent filming. Through selection of shots and changes in cutting pace and speed of camera movement, the film fluctuates between record and abstraction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1TNsP3heOhnjw9R5yE50gZnCXKa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hackney Marshes – November 4th 1977","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
