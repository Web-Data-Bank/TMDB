She deserves a gift, one that makes an impression. He wants to marry her and can’t wait any longer. So he heads out into the jungle armed with a pickaxe, since there is no app to find what he has in mind for her: gemstones. Gemstones are the path to freedom, his way out of the dreary small town – with her at his side.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qAFHoZLMkKV0iETh9YgOljv5a3d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2018-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alma Bandida","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
