Between 1985 and 1987 D’León issued a succession of albums featuring some of his strongest material, inspired playing and assured arrangements, which justified his position as one of salsa’s true international stars. The definitive albums of this period were 1987’s Riquiti..! and La Salsa Soy Yo. In June and October 1988, D’León demonstrated his live reputation by playing three sell-out concerts at London’s Hackney Empire. The last was recorded and broadcast in 1989 as a programme in BBC television’s Rhythms Of The World world music series, then released as Oscar D’León Live, the first salsa video to be issued in the UK.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pLM2v2WA5eNFQlb5aKYtRLnwZWj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Presencia Caribe: Oscar D' Leon","title":"Oscar D' Leon - Live From London","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
