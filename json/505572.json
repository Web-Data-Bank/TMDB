A musical documentary where you see the musicians struggling with the computer, fine-tuning the recording, smoking a cigarette against the sea spray of Ouessant or riding a scooter down the island's pebbly tracks.","popularity":2.881,"poster_path":"/myvLaSXnDYRgF74vRgUqqe2o2n4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101043,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMI France","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"D'apres une idee originale","title":"The Crossing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
