Starring, Hedda Lettuce and Miss Understood as a pair of none-too-glam dragqueens, down on their luck and living the low life in New York City circa 1992. A not particularly bright scheme to reinvent themselves as Bonnie and Bunny, bank robbers in daring frocks, rockets them to fame and finally gives them enough cash to hire a posh, Eastern European, interior decorator, specializing in rococo. But all is not feather boas and sequins. The envy of Brenda, bitchy Morticia Adams clone, and Violet, a whip-wielding dominatrix, scheme to ruin the party.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1UjfsByckiv0jjey1PXcc6UjSEt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Lipstick","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
