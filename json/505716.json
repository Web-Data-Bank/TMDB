That’s where the ATF’s National Tracing Center handles roughly 8,000 active traces per day — all while inside a government-mandated technology time-capsule that makes searching a database of gun owners impossible. This is nothing like those cop shows you watch. With more gun stores in the U.S.A. than McDonalds, Starbucks, and supermarkets combined, there’s a lot of paperwork to manually sort through. And it's truly a sight to behold.","popularity":0.999,"poster_path":"/zVUW1Eo6j6sncj6Qg4B8iw8s0zQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An American paper trail.","title":"Guns Found Here","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":5}
