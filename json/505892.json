How far will she go when leaves start to obscure her panorama, her light and her happiness? A brilliant blend of stop-motion, projections and models, drawings and altered live-action transports us into a meditation on the tension between urban life and the natural environment. Like Don Giovanni, will our ambitious protagonist stop at nothing to get her way?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p9CVgGFEcnJMtH49Fb7KpM1mBKr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
