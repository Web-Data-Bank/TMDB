Or so the Cassidy family assume when they discover an apparent alien in a shiny red space suit and helmet passed out on the living room floor beside the drinks cabinet. The Cassidys and the people of Ballymoran make the intriguing visitor feel very welcome (and in the case of mother Mary, Donna Dent, and teenage minx Jenny, Janice Byrne, they make him feel very welcome indeed). At first, Zonad tries to evade the warm welcome of the villagers, although the procession of wanton women and free beer gets the better of him.
