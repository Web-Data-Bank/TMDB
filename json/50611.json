Call him a tenderfoot. But don't call him a member of the family--yet. Rising L.A. lawyer James White is going home for the holidays with his fianc√©e, Sadie Ryder, to finally meet her family in rural Pine Gap. After blundering through a bad first impression, James attempts to win over Sadie's lawyer-loathing father Karl by pretending to be a horse-riding, hay-baling, game-hunting, seasoned square dancer. But a pair of worn jeans and a ten-gallon hat don't make a cowboy, and it's going to take more than mere posturing to charm Mr. Ryder... in fact, it just might take a miracle.","popularity":2.769,"poster_path":"/A9ehrsxEbyk7k7RY9WIH5GOKHuk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20358,"logo_path":"/jPZ0jwLGGELbSxKoUrJzOytNpnp.png","name":"RHI Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Larry Levinson Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":23419,"logo_path":null,"name":"MavroCine Pictures GmbH \u0026 Co.
