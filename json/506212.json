The war ended five years ago and nothing remains of the city. Massive bombings and intense fighting lasting more than a month turned the city, its docks, its arsenal, into ashes. Thousands of workers will build it up again, brick by brick. But with awful work conditions protests quickly arise and a strike begins. Violent confrontations happen during manifestations. Until one man falls.  The next day René Vautier lands at Brest clandestinely to make a movie about the movement.","popularity":1.31,"poster_path":"/lgqExnF6BhrDwAAMguEDwObWywO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Armateurs","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":20346,"logo_path":null,"name":"Région Bretagne","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Man is Dead","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":18}
