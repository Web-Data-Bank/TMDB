Saddened by this observation, we wanted to offer him a frame, both real and cinematographic, in which he could renew a dialogue that was interrupted at that moment. The choice of his interlocutor was immediately obvious: Elias Sanbar, Palestinian, historian, director of the magazine \"Palestinian Studies\", collector of images: an exile who archives the memory of his people: press photographs, album of family, postcards, etc. For Sanbar, the image is a proof of his identity. Daney spent most of his life watching movies, but has always refused to keep still images. On both sides, there was a very strong desire to confront these two attitudes in the face of the image and to make it, in a way, a parable of the North-South relations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conversation nord-sud : Daney/Sanbar","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
