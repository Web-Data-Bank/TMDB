The first play from the Classic Spring Theatre Company’s Oscar Wilde Season, A Woman of No Importance will be captured live for cinemas from the Vaudeville Theatre in London’s West End. An earnest young American woman, a louche English lord, and an innocent young chap join a house party of fin de siècle fools and grotesques. Nearby a woman lives, cradling a long-buried secret. First performed in 1893, Oscar Wilde’s marriage of glittering wit and Ibsenite drama satirised the socially conservative world of the Victorian upper-class, creating a vivid new theatrical voice which still resonates today.","popularity":0.848,"poster_path":"/dPbmMomzMr4OfiA2egbal7ahRc1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Woman of No Importance","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
