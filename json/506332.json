In 1948, Hay founded the Mattachine Society in Los Angeles; the goal of the organization was to establish a \"Golden Brotherhood,\" one that sought to redefine homosexuality as a normal, healthy way of life. The problem, Hay famously maintained, was not homosexuality itself, but the way it was treated by society. Dramatizations, photographs, archival footage, and interviews with original Mattachine Society members are all incorporated to tell Hay's remarkable story, one whose legacy continues to be felt in the treatment of gays and lesbians in culture today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wsfLIn6CyKlK6TnBYcRCZVv7sEW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hope Along the Wind: The Story of Harry Hay","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
