Therefore, he fills the void. With his films which, although poor and consciously making use of new electronic means, range from documentaries to traditional fiction, from poetic short films to experimental films, and which talk directly, without mediation, about gays, transvestites, couples, families, betrayals, battuage, and homosexual normality, touching every genre, like nobody had ever dared to do in Italy before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yeqTakmazo6GGDo0PsMsBzy9zQZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ottavio Mario Mai","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
