Strangely enough, the subject of Wildbolz's documentary also died relatively young, the painter Erich \"Ricco\" Wassmer (1915-1972). Perhaps because it was prophetic, or because Wildbolz sensed his fate and truly identified with Ricco, the life of the artist is related with a captivating poignancy, from his privileged but troubled childhood in Germany, to his artistic triumphs in Bern, to his career-wrecking imprisonment on the charge of immorality, ending with his life-draining illness in France. Wildbolz portrays Ricco as a victim throughout, a man misunderstood by bourgeois society and despised for his pursuit of exotic experiences (which, by the way, included an obsession with naked boys).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7KoImNzXynJUcApu3k6ac8lVYCq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ricco","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
