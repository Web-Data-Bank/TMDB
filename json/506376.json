Parts of the recording project were caught on video by independent filmmakers Aaron, Seth, and Justin Howland, three brothers more formally known as 7 Fluid Oz. Productions. With just a little rough footage, On the Way had its start. Following the release of Ten Thousand Mornings, the Howlands spent nine months capturing Peter's engaging and dynamic above-ground performances at venues in and around Boston, including the beautiful 800-seat Somerville Theatre and the intimate Club Passim in Harvard Square.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rh0fpmdQ0eDP2KV1FdpQANUEZcf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Mulvey: On the Way","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
