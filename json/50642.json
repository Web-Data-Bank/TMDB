The movie shows the fight of the fairy tale characters, now adults, who come together to recover the fable of the Little Ugly Princess, a beautiful Princess with a strange name, which only makes sense for those who know her story. The problem is that children and adults have forgotten the story of the Little Ugly Princess, which is as wonderful as other major fables for children. Cinderella brings together other fairy tale characters to meet the writer who keeps, lost in a small notebook, the Little Ugly Princess story.","popularity":2.245,"poster_path":"/yMWLeBSAA6Zh9Br03nfGUbES0ly.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8435,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xuxa Produções","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":2429,"logo_path":"/s0p6DEF7H9yooJFjKhN4lFpTiVk.png","name":"Conspiração Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":93258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Playarte Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2009-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Xuxa and the Mystery of the Little Ugly Princess","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":51}
