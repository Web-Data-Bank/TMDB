In the late 1970s, Erik is accepted by the Danish National Film School where he enters a world of angry and unhelpful tutors, weird fellow students and unwritten rules. In this both exhilarating and angst-provoking period for him, Erik feels increasingly like a foreigner in the film industry. Frequently, he is merely an observer of the absurdities that surround him. He encounters trade union disputes, falls in love and experiences self-assured empowered women who refuse to make a commitment. The film is a drama full of comedy - a sharp portrait of a conceited but entertaining world of film which we suspect our dogged young director will eventually conquer with his vision.","popularity":1.543,"poster_path":"/mJtCCIzPNpEunLAm1ZLATEUrxf4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76,"logo_path":"/nebkQYtQKhZyHJfh5v0oGpNbPzu.png","name":"Zentropa Entertainments","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2007-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Early Years: Erik Nietzsche Part 1","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":10}
