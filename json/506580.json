What is truth, and what is fiction? How does one discern reality from pretense? These are serious questions, but if you're looking for answers à la Japanese abstraction, German expressionism or Swedish nihilism, keep looking, because The Wedding Video has the answer, \"REAL WORLD\" style. In the first film to come out of the MTV phenomenon, Norman Korpi (the gay guy from \"Real World-New York\") and creative partner Clint Cowen have made a deliciously wicked satire that skewers all the clichés and conventions of the reality show.","popularity":0.95,"poster_path":"/fpERs88JfpyUiLhaHc6BLlYG0qR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wedding Video","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
