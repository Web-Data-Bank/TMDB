When he is caught with an essay titled “Shame and Lust”, he is indeed kicked out – instead of classmate Melchior Gabor, who actually penned it. Gabor was drawing on his experiences with neighbourhood girl Wendla. Then Wendla turns up pregnant. Stiefel descends into despair ... Exploitation between Eros and Thanatos in this “sexual tragedy of youth” based on Frank Wedekind’s play. Setting the film in the 1920s provided a chance to explore “modern” youth culture, complete with cigarettes, jazz music, the gramophone, and a goodly bit of alcohol. Richard Oswald, a master of films of manners and young sex beginning in the 1910s, fully explores the temptations of the youthful body, even early childhood flirtatiousness. At the same time, with his target audience in mind, the film laments the bigotry and double standards of the adult world.","popularity":0.849,"poster_path":"/eybSd0YYI3XYTZoQn1JxymWEWhQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29739,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hegewald Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Richard Oswald Produktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1929-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spring Awakening","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
