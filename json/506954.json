It seems that Nick Name and the Normals are out to offend everyone. Whether they're being attacked by uptight homosexuals or dismissed by unresponsive heterosexuals, it's hard to deny that sheer power of this unique hardcore act. Now, on the road, Skora's unflinching camera remains fixed on Name as he confronts the demons of his past while forging ahead into the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y84w0FTvtqQFwtMG0MzA6tdwUqd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nick Name & The Normals","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":1}
