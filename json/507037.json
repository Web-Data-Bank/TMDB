Patrice Chéreau’s acclaimed production—the last staging he worked on before his death in 2013—also stars Waltraud Meier as Klytämnestra, Elektra’s nightmare-haunted mother, Adrianne Pieczonka as Chrysothemis, her sister, and Eric Owens as Orest, their brother, whose return home brings their family story to a terrifying climax. Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the monumental and highly influential score.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/czwk9wbfh3WumIToiqpFYbjbQnb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Metropolitan Opera: Elektra","title":"Strauss: Elektra","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
