It’s a fascinating plot about a boy raised by a triad kingpin in the 1930s. When the godfather dies, the young Xiang is given power over the gang and the master’s household. Trying to be faithful to the old man’s principles, Xiang finds himself unable to control his master’s widow and daughter, who are led astray by the widow’s worldly, greedy sister. At the same time, Xiang must ally with other triads to smuggle aid to the forces fighting the invading Japanese. He is torn between devotion to tradition and the need to adapt to modern materialism and the impending world war.\"  (From David Borwdell's blog: http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2014/04/15/genre-%E2%89%A0-generic/)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1955-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tradition","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
