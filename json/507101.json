But the elevated role they once held has now faded. Today they live in isolated communities, working as prostitutes and beggars. Life may be hard but inside the community, there's a real sense of warmth and camaraderie. 'Harsh Beauty' follows the lives of Jyothi, Usha and Hira Bai, three Eunuchs who struggle for acceptance in a culture splintered by religion, caste and politics. Filmed over four years and accompanied by a vibrant soundtrack, it's a warm and poignant look inside this usually hidden group.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hxpH7QoF6oepgKoOCSXlilWKWP3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harsh Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
