A short film about sexual impulses in adolescence, repression and child abuse, a meager, precise, and very tough film, like a documentary.  A searing drama about boyhood cruelty and the societal forces behind it. On a camping trip, two kids and their fathers spend some time in the great outdoors. The boys are mostly left on their own, to fish, ride four-wheelers, and argue over their favorite soccer stars. As the day progresses though, the mood darkens when one of the boys begins provoking the other in unsettling ways. Set against picturesque woodsy vistas and idyllic horse rides.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tbuXNrzkGpUounfkP3wvSV6GQSa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Distrito Films","origin_country":""},{"id":110324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmaciones de la Ciudad","origin_country":""},{"id":84645,"logo_path":"/chCohwvNl0TZEGaxI4UGZN4NK5L.png","name":"Terminal","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2018-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guilt","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
