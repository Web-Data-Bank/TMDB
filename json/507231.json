Scarpia captures Cavaradossi and has him tortured within earshot of his lover, the singer Tosca.  Scarpia sentences Cavaradossi to death – but promises Tosca that her lover can be saved if she gives herself to Scarpia. Tosca consents but as soon as the order has been given kills Scarpia. Scarpia’s menace continues even in death: betrayed by a double-cross, Cavaradossi dies and Tosca leaps to her death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/anz8bHIYs62jyxAmK5nEDRKsUH4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The ROH Live: Tosca","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
