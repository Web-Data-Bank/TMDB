A small town nestled in the shadow of a gigantic factory. Ben, a shy eleven year old boy, lives there alone with his mom when she leaves him to strike. The coming of the troubling Eva in his bunch disturbs him a little bit more, especially when she mentions the legend of a mysterious creature hidden under a nearby lake's pontoon. As a game, Eva challenges Ben: walk through the \"pontoon of the death\", and come back. But Ben fails miserably. At night, the Creature appears to him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fi0NP9ONrMOJSm0LZeVVYky5imi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68259,"logo_path":null,"name":"Origine Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Love Eva Marsh","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
