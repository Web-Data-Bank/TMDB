Using a non-linear structure that weaves together dreams and memory, Jon Rafman creates a stream-of-consciousness meditation on art, identity and time that draw on the work of Leonard Cohen. The film intercuts digitally processed found photos and 3D landscapes sourced from video games to tell the enigmatic voyage of one man's soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qWWDMAQmja7SLRsj7GmeMqOPH3N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Legendary Reality","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
