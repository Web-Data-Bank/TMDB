Like in Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale \"The Loveliest Rose in the World\" where a prince must search for a rose to save his mother, who is dying in bed, \"Tied Hands\" sees a reversal of roles as a desperate mother goes out to find marijuana, to ease her son's pain. In her, turbulent journey in the streets of Tel-Aviv, old truths from her past come back to life and threaten to break down a wall of denials behind which, she's been hiding all her life.","popularity":1.092,"poster_path":"/cUyf2DEFJEr0qBQut6UYQXp069R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tied Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
