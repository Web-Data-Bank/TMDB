For many observers, the attitude towards the sexual minorities seems to be the litmus test of the state of democracy in Russia. In January 2007, for the first time in Russian history, a Russian leader, president Vladimir Putin mentions the situation of the LGBT community: He won't criticize the politics of Moscow mayor Yuri Lushkov, who forbid the event, but he is concerned about the demographic future of the country. And Putins opinion seems to be repeated by the right wing contra demonstrators on the streets. The film shows both the organizers of the Pride events and also the survival strategies of the majority Russian lesbians and gays, to whom the fight for democracy on the streets doesn't seem to be an attractive alternative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1iAfju47qCUxLJTFohuaJ3wNrx9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"East/West: Sex & Politics","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
