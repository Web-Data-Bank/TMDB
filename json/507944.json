Why did she choose these three pieces, in essence so different, but which intimately resonate with her: Berio’s Sequenza III, Berg’s Lulu Suite, and Gershwin’s Girl Crazy? With this musical voyage peering into a world of precision and sharing, where a passionate woman brings forth a vocal tour de force, Mathieu Amalric, César winner for Best Actor in 2005 and 2008, shows us once more his talent behind the camera with this new opus that goes beyond a mere artist’s portrait.","popularity":0.848,"poster_path":"/vh2hl8qnvU4usKfTxL2ow7O8xF1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music is Music/Crazy Girl Crazy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
