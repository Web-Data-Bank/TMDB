She inspires the young generation to chase their goals and the rest of us - to be proud of Lithuania. Ruta is much more than a great athlete, she is the symbol of today's Lithuania. Currently a documentary is being produced that will allow the viewers to see Ruta's daily life from up close and hopefully understand a bit more about the amount of hard work that goes into preparing for this short distance swim.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c3MjZm1d68XVD3zWRT7xlz8ZTPq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74856,"logo_path":"/2QvzRCsjivRhFdiwlNXpaipL7w9.png","name":"Lithuanian Film Center","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":109861,"logo_path":null,"name":"White T Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2018-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rūta","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
