This documentary offers an interesting insight into the official and non-official cinema from the point of view of gender identity. A look behind the scenes: discussing issues like censorship and self-censorship, women' cinema and misogyny, transvestism and homo-eroticism, cinema d'auteur and popular cinema (was the Nouvelle Vague homophobic?). From past to present, from Jacques Demy to François Ozon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aOfrsPpoNGprYA36WDVmh3qCiRq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De la cage aux roseaux","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
