They discuss clothes, music, school and that first kiss. A delightful coming-of-age film in which the here and now is all that really matters. Where every little thing is so very important and where feelings sometimes bubble over. In your teens, thereâ€™s no room for anything but friendship and love.","popularity":4.085,"poster_path":"/zsnQGmdK9buffM4nI5Z1rrsLOi5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12923,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Bros Pictures Italia","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1533,"logo_path":"/6ZdM1yg1LXtzS5zpuZPtZsn9YdA.png","name":"Indigo Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That's Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":200}
