During her desperate quest, Kaitlyn meets Esther and Sheriff Charlie Taggart, who describe the town as a place where souls have become trapped between the world of the living, and the world of the dead. They warn of a looming presence known only as Stingy Jack, who will stop at nothing to keep Kaitlyn from her son by manipulating her perception of reality, testing her limits not only as a mother, but also as a human being. In a town where souls have seemingly become detached, Kaitlyn's time is running out and she must find Milo before his soul becomes trapped in the town forever.","popularity":1.013,"poster_path":"/hHR0mvzFeYu3gg1qIuZmsQgrJ47.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"Every little town has its secrets.
