Gustavo was the son every Jewish family would love to have. One day Gustavo told his friends about his being gay, and they simply did not get it. So he thought his family would. But his mom got depressed when she found the love letters he had written to his partner Jorge. And Gustavo moved away from his people. Daniel longs for being a dad. But on account of his homosexuality, he cannot picture himself as one yet, so he is concerned about his continuity. Dan is an artist. As a gay, he felt more discriminated at Jewish community schools than at public schools. Then he realized how odd it was, to be segregated by the ones who are often segregated in turn. Diego is an architect. And he is also trying to build some space for gay people within the Jewish community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rO9ar14C3nz1vmqA7wiWnBi6LYR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Otro entre otros","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
