At the beginning of the film we meet a witty, young lesbian called Maggie who sets off on a road trip from Cape Town to Johannesburg to attend Gay Pride there. Against this backdrop of the beautiful, ever-changing African landscapes on her travels, we are introduced to a diverse range of compelling South African lesbians and their stories. Through personal and intimate conversations, we are taken on a journey of sexual discovery, self acceptance and ultimately self pride.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c9Hr0ETDY7ceCgmym0P3LT9AYsz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road to Pride","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
