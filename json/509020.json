It seems that nothing can stand in the way of their relationship, but every person gradually starts to feel animal instincts: uncontrolled aggression, protection of offspring, spontaneous sexual desire. When Liv disappears, Hamming has to make an important step â€“ to face the world endangering his very own life in order to find her.","popularity":3.122,"poster_path":"/m02qR11agwJkH85Lm8M7lMddKj8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monomania Films","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Destroy Yourself, Free The Planet","title":"Involution","video":false,"vote_average":3.75,"vote_count":4}
