In relating their personal stories, these remarkable men and women take us back to the 1970's and 1980's, creating a vivid portrait of how a small, dedicated group tackled the seeming-impossible: the attainment of the world's first law that affirmatively recognized same-sex relationships. In doing so, they changed the very language that is used to describe same-sex relationships and created a template that spread worldwide. Their accomplishment made possible today's efforts to establish marriage equality. Their contribution is revealed in this stirring documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nLdAQWqkd2ivJ57XN9EvAJVQQhS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen Change","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
