The film looks at the way we so casually live in a class system built on blatant economic and social disparities, the way we so want to be fooled by our belief systems. By exploring a counter-point for every point, the film subtly questions not only our material value system but also our emotional value system. The plot revolves around a road trip gone wrong. The idea was to keep the seriousness of the situation but present it in a humorous manner with characters, plots, and nuances that are realistic but at the same quirky and humorous, leaving the audience with a feel-good buzz.","popularity":0.875,"poster_path":"/5Vb4GRX8PNFgbUPsB4kvo8OWr7P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yahaan Sabki Lagi Hai","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
