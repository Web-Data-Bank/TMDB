Strangers pulled him to safety, giving him a second chance at life and propelling him on a global journey to explore the limits of body, mind, spirit and art. Spanning Germany, Canada, Japan, Kenya, and the United States, Fox's journey includes collaborations with Canadian First-Nations artist Rande Cook and African-American artist Zulu, who help him memorialize his experiences in a full back tattoo. In our digital age where personal confession and self-exposure abound, Fox instead transforms his experiences into art, making a film that is both innovative and accessible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vJzYbh380XqTNQdubZhI0HRR4Ib.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Skin I'm In","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
