Simone, a young lesbian mother, survives being shot outside of her home by anti-gay gunmen. She must choose between living in hiding with her daughter in Jamaica or traveling alone to seek safety and asylum abroad.

He escapes to Canada, but decides to return to continue his activism.","popularity":0.922,"poster_path":"/lAufEzeqxYlKFgUVfEyZIHlJtqo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When Your Love Is Against the Law","title":"The Abominable Crime","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
