While planted on the scene as apprentice to Bergman, Vilgot Sjöman (director, I Am Curious–Yellow, 1967), suggests to Swedish Television that they take the opportunity to record with the acclaimed director. In August, Sjöman and the television crew begin to capture what would become a comprehensive five-part documentary on the making of Winter Light, offering views of script development, set construction and lighting, rehearsals and editing, as well as intimate conversations with Bergman and members of his cast and crew. Footage from the film’s Swedish premiere delivers immediate audience reactions and the critics’ reviews the following day.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/ddpqJy4kG0cn5cvnyZOqL4MWkMD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9138,"logo_path":"/14AzgC0B2KT231csPJsramojWlN.png","name":"Sveriges Radio (SR)","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1963-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":14}
