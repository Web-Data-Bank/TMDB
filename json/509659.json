In Germany, gay couples are not allowed to adopt children. The two men grapple with endless bureaucracy; lifted by hope and plagued by anxiety about what lies ahead. Franziska von Malsen accompanies Dario and Markus through this time of anticipation. She portrays the lives of a couple about to become parents − not, in the end, of a baby, but of a five year-old boy with a story of his own. HAPPY SERIOUS SAD relates how Dario and Markus gradually, sensitively come to embrace their son and his past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n2xCqjSlVfXWfmUKizFxEPktSiG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Serious Sad","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
