Erotomania is a type of schizophrenia where the sufferer can’t distinguish between real life and one’s own imagination life. One day my grandma suddenly said, ”I had someone I truly loved when I was young and he is looking for me to pick me up” The next day, she started riding a taxi for few hours trying to find him. ... No one knows if my grandmother’s true love exists or not. ... At the same time as my grandmother I was also on a search. I was looking for angels. My interest in angels started when I discovered Paul Klee’s Angel Drowning series. This series had a profound effect on me. Within the same week my friend took me to a Walter Benjamin lecture where they discussed his angel theories. It was synchronicity. My grandmother and I were both searching for something, something that no one knew existed or not.\" -UMMMI.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xvn2xGzhoDtn5aB5vs5K7z6LaIh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angel at the Dump","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
