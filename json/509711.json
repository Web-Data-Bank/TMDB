That’s the contention – convincingly borne out by some fabulously sweaty disco archive – of Queer as Pop, the story of how, time and again, music has filtered from the gay scene to the mainstream. The rise of disco, the death of disco, house, hi-NRG, the Village People and the moment when David Bowie put his arm round Mick Ronson on Top of the Pops: it’s all here. This documentary reveals how the social and political liberation of homosexual men has influenced the music mainstream over the past 40 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sbYTJrEoVstMcSmzK16e9ut3Zfw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queer as Pop: From the Gay Scene to the Mainstream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
