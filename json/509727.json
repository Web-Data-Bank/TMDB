The French filmmaker Sylvie Ballyot was shooting a feminist documentary in Yemen when her tapes were requisitioned by the authorities. Adrift in unknown territory with the only help of a translator, Ballyot carried on, shooting images of herself in public spaces â€“the only woman in a crowd of men. Her reactions in a culture she is not familiar with get combined with interviews with students who talk about love, family, and sexuality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and Words Are Politics","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
