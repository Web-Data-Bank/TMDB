In 1921, Shipman refused a contract with Sam Goldfish (later Goldwyn) and moved to the Idaho wilderness with a zoo of 70 wild animals to write, direct, produce and act in movies portraying women as self-reliant heroines who rescued their male leads. Shipman performed her own stunts and developed an uncanny rapport with her animal actors. The film reveals the forgotten legacy of Shipman and a generation of female silent film pioneers. The documentary includes rare footage of these artists, including minority filmmakers, Zora Neale Hurston and Miriam Wong. Geena Davis and women directors discuss gender-inequities Nell and her counterparts faced that perpetuate in today's film industry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bP1hJM3pO8HO1n1kDJM6R8slOB3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl from God's Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
