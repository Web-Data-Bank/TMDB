This immersive new documentary reveals the Nazi’s complicated relationship with classical and modern art, displaying an incredible number of masterpieces by Botticelli, Klee, Matisse, Monet, Chagall, Renoir and Gauguin amongst others, intertwined with human stories from the most infamous period of the twentieth century.  A state-of-the-art detective story exploring the Nazis’ obsession with creative expression, Hitler versus Picasso combines history, art and human drama for an unforgettable cinema experience.","popularity":2.458,"poster_path":"/oP2gP06isyDzL7moxlM45dH7IU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70848,"logo_path":"/8az9c810uHeW4A3fxt6B93QGg3c.png","name":"3D Produzioni","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":41020,"logo_path":"/8bTFt8ZXSvrmMO16T3kQvX2yViT.png","name":"Nexo Digital","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":103243,"logo_path":"/esey8xaQsmjHsq1lTFvio2JCN5Q.png","name":"Sharmill Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Nazi Obsession For Art","title":"Hitler Versus Picasso","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":36}
