The film centers around five of the most significant representatives of contemporary Chinese counterculture: the visual artists the Gao Brothers, the choreographer and dancer Wen Hui, the animation artist Pi San and the poet Ye Fu. With bravery and subversive wit, they each shed light on the social problems in their country. In doing so, the film poses universal questions that ultimately concern us all: which values determine our cultural identity and in what kind of world do we want to live.","popularity":0.715,"poster_path":"/mxLi5luEFGJFzLNNpvXR7hDAvBy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156854,"logo_path":null,"name":"go between films GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":74160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Recycled TV","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Long Way Home takes us on a fascinating journey into both the grim days of recent Chinese history and the dazzling cultural scene in present-day China.","title":"A Long Way Home","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
