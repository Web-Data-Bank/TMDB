So after saying a few words of parting at her mother’s grave, she sets out on a cross continent journey, though mountains and jungles in search of her father, who has been trapped in a landslide at a construction site on a remote tropical lake. In the middle of the lake stands the ancient Tree of Life, watched over by innocent, bumbling forest spirits called the Migoo, who grow and change shape as they please, morphing from small childlike beings to petulant giants. The Migoo have been disrupting the construction to protect this sacred site – and now together with Mia they join in a fight to find Mia’s father and save the Tree, with the future of life on Earth hanging in the balance.","popularity":2.957,"poster_path":"/bTTxuvQMvsqSqpMXz33yH2WiDOH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8212,"logo_path":"/pkWt7XNwx5GssnXmTsXLKNpalaH.png","name":"Folimage","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mia and the Migoo","video":false,"vote_average":6.952,"vote_count":31}
