We witness the painstaking activity of a fisherman in a Chinese village. Spring has arrived after a long winter, and it’s time to get the fishing boat ready for use. The work looks simple enough—making holes in the ice and scraping away thick layers of snow—but it’s vitally important, literally a matter of survival, to do it right.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aaxH2BpCXXjkpZJwmL9H0yX9Pu4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2017-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AWAKEN","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
