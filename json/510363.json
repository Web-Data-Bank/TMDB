But somewhere along the way, one of his sons got caught up in the fast-paced, rough and tumble life of a street hip-hop rapper. The halls grew silent, the walls cold, and every waking minute was punctuated by the inability of Charles to be twice the son his father needed.  Then one day, something magical happened. A family was reunited, as if in a storybook.  For a while, they were a family again. Sam put his hip-hop days behind him and his dad and brother welcomed him home, with loving arms. Charles agreed to let bygones be bygones, and soon the boys were back to their boyish selves, hearty laughs around every corner. Just goes to show ya, the power of family.  But...  Can a fantasy last?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q8u4z9Ss2gK5KrT8N3W06VZMCxD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thanks, Computer!","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"You crank yourself off.
