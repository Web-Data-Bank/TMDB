Her parents split up before she was one year old and today, like many separated couples, they are brought back together under the same roof only because they don’t have a decent job. Cristina, her mother, rents a part of the house to her ex-husband for a bit of extra money. “Francia” talks about those people who will never travel far from their home, where they take refuge, for good or bad, from all disgusting things in the outside world. Meanwhile, Mariana puts on her headphones when she hears her parents fighting. Those fights which now serve as a relief to the helpless.","popularity":0.738,"poster_path":"/71cmRBq2lQMQlPICYL0ATEhZjfL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":6459,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Expresión del Deseo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2010-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Have you ever dreamed of traveling?","title":"France","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
