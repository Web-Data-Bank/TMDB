One hundred and fifty years in the future, Africa has become a single, sprawling metropolis controlled by a race of immortal beings, and full of regular mortals dying from a disease called Bad Luck. As Wanita leaves home one morning, a prayer to her ancestors unwittingly starts her on a path to the Dimsi â€” another dimension, invisible to the eye, but discoverable by the soul. Can Wanita follow her DNA to break free from the shackles of the immortals? A purposely unfinished work, NAKED REALITY boldly leaves the audience with a blank canvas to interpret and create, as Bekolo grants viewers access to limitless answers waiting to be unearthed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oAdNCXJ9INhTM0GRxCxHceus0W9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jean-Pierre Bekolo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"}],"release_date":"2016-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naked Reality","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
