With a squandered inheritance and one week to salvage their future, they have to navigate their way through a world of Russian contractors, tween actresses, aging hippies and golf-club billionaires. Last thing they want is a naked amnesiac showing up at their door... But maybe she's exactly what they need.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Underwater Upside Down","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
