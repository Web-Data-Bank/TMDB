Spanning four decades, from the 1930s to the early 1970s, the snapshots provide a rare look at a vanished and vibrant Lesbian culture: images of lovers and friends as they played, posed, serially switched partners, worked, partied, drank, and aged. Now we all take selfies; these women used a Brownie camera to tell the story of their community. LIVES: VISIBLE explores the ephemeral nature of culture and the power of the images we make.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dVPOgl6I7TdCM98lQaRpFlHU9l3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lives: Visible","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
