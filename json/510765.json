Antonio hides his physical and emotional pain from his all-knowing mother, Cynthia, who suffered such a tremendous amount of abuse at the hands of Antonio's father that Antonio became a nurse to heal pain that he could not heal as a child. Antonio is jolted out of his denial by one of his patients, Michelle , who is also, a frequent victim of domestic violence. While Michelle does not consider herself a victim, but as simply part of a couple that \"loves hard and fight hard\", a critical incident involving Michelle at the clinic forces Antonio to confront his own situation and reevaluate the \"magic and tragic\" of his life with Kirk before it is too late.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7iv7Bvlx7Vyk3kpNmp2vW8JqmOG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unimaginable","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
