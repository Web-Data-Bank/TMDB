The film follows three protagonists—Mrs. Queen Esther Bernetta White, Girl, and WB (“whiteboy”)—as they navigate the dramas of surveillance, moving between looking, being looked at, and remaining unseen. How does the ever present potential image affect the way we act and the way we see ourselves? By examining how cinema now happens in real time, Syms works between the documented and the live to find the lie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fyUYpjV13tH2LhqrebjJlu9Z0iG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incense, Sweaters, & Ice","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
