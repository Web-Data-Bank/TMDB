It’s a melancholic journey to the past, a visit to mystical Villa Mehu built by a deceased ITE artist Elis Sinistö. Located deep in the woods of Veklahti, Finland, Villa Mehu served as Sinistö’s home for 50 years and it was also the greatest artwork of his life although it has never got the respect that it should deserve. Today, after Sinistö’s death, it is decaying slowly but surely towards its final demolition without anyone even noticing. “Villa Mehu – A Lost Home” takes its audience to a hypnotic journey through the bizarre yet beautiful world of Elis Sinistö. It is both a tribute to his lifework and an attempt to save a little piece of Finland’s cultural history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2018-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Villa Mehu – A Lost Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
