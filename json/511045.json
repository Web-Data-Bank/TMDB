Including the Gender Identity Law (Law No. 26 743, enacted in 2012). These rights represent an advance on legal equality. However, there is still the challenge of social inclusion to the Trans community. And it is here where we find Kimby. She struggles in that universe. Sometimes she is working on the train or trying to work on sidewalk near the Retiro station selling sandwiches, candies, lighters or pairs of socks. And she travels every day in the San Martin and North Belgrano train in her act of daily survival. Without family and with just a friend, Mary, her permanent support, she spends days in the Capital. Among his odd jobs and his unrequited love, far from her beloved mountains of Cordoba, she dreams with a 'real job' and that married man, who she loves so much, he plays someday for her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tMlnFG98U90KXpBxSSLb6A0lzai.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las decisiones formales","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
