In summer. In a small town of the deep Sologne. Caleb, a fifteen-year-old teenager with the physique of a Greek god, seduces Nadine, a forty-year-old librarian, out of idleness, by lying to her about his age and identity. Caleb has a brother, Estéban, who aspires to become a novelist. It is Estéban who directs his brother exactly as a film scriptwriter would. He instigates his brother's every move. He is the one who invents the twists and turns of this story of seduction that they both think has no consequences. Nadine, of course, falls in love with this young man whom she introduces to her husband Pierre who, in turn, is bewitched by the young man's charm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fYGD9WlkLMGGTA65sQrRZ6mQgxf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les démons meurent à l'aube","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
