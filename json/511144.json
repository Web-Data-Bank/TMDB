Who are they, anyway? And what are they thinking about? French visual artists and co-directors Lewis Trondheim and Jean Matthieu Tanguy take great delight in speculating on the above, with style, aplomb, and a little help from singer/musician Thomas Fersen, whose narration amusingly adopts the tone of an ad man. Consisting of an impressive tracking shot through the passenger car of a train, Panoramic Chronicle takes a common, humdrum experience and turns it into a captivating journey thatâ€™s tinged with some deliciously deadpan humour. A slice of everyday life, courtesy of the Comic Strip Chronicles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tt1kJNzh6wDabjHKStx1Fs8pZZB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panoramic Chronicle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
