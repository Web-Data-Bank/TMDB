Stone engravings record a complete absence of cooperation between the Egyptian ruler and his slaves but, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, there was a gradual change towards recognition of the labourer. With the growth of factories, the trend received a setback, but reasserted itself through the expediencies of World War II, which saw the formation of the first Labour Management Production Committee (LMPC) in Britain. In post-war Canada the film shows LMPCs well implanted in industrial life, with the Industrial Production Cooperation Board giving official government recognition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/194PyeCW6j4jdWnwp7j6gVvWX3R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teamwork - Past and Present","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
