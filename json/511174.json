The commentary, delivered with the perspicacity of a coroner's report, follows the development of the doodler's mania from boyhood through adolescence to manhood, when it suddenly breaks all bounds. An amusing \"case history\" that some of us might identify with.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6MdLPLUGO3vNGKhZSeWB4Q6c0sL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doodle Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
