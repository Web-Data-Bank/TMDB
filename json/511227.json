I grew up in a fundamental Christian community that built their identity on the understanding of Christianity to be the only true way of living, and therefore a critical reflection about the absolute rightness of their beliefs was utterly out of question. Nonbelievers were seen as \"lacking something\", as people who either need to be educated or avoided. A binary opposition which decried all non-Christian cultures and people as incomplete was imposed, in order to define their own Christian identity as superior and to gain power over the other. The supremacy of an all-encompassing God who divides the world in \"right\" and \"wrong\", \"heaven\" and \"hell\" and the demand to commit to such a God always felt restrictive to me and deprived me of the agency.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qpatFeTZ527KAp7Tq4ukqL6XpYK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A lot of things don't, don't really exist anymore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
