No sooner has the paint dried, than the puppet begins to take its first few steps and, urged on by the artist, begins to discover a wider world. He experiences the joys of playtime and sharing and eventually begins to spread his social wings. The film charts the shaping of a personality, and the evolution of a sense of self-awareness until the creature is ready to leave its protective environment. Live-action, puppets and pixilation create this amazing world of fantasy. Film without words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w7ijOyaS8uP3ZXb0p9Bpg6AC67m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Box","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
