The film portrays his thoughts, his dreams, and his beliefs, and allows for an intimate immersion into his life. Paulusie is a caring son to his ailing father and a good boyfriend. But what begins as the story of an innocent teenager quickly becomes the struggle of a young man coping with the guilt of having made a huge mistake. Tragically, Paulusie takes the most dramatic decision and takes his own life. Living with Giants remains a poetic journey of resilience that echoes issues that are far greater than Paulusie's personal story.","popularity":1.376,"poster_path":"/aMfYg4w95fYBdSbKgwsA2zkxZfD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living with Giants","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
