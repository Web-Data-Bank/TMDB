As gay rights have progressed, the Invasion has been used to take a satirical look at the world around us. Long before Congress was hashing out marriage equality, invaders were challenging the mainstream ideals and demanding change by fighting against bias, AIDS, sexism, bigotry and traditional gender roles. It's so much more than a day of drinking and drag. It is a tradition that honors those that came before us and it's a glimpse into what the world would be like if we had true openness and independence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rZWZSe1eQAf89ML5qL3cGMuvIIw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Panzi Invasion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
