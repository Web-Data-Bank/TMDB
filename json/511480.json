Jamie fishes, plucks ducks, and traps rabbits. He helps his mother churn butter, collect eggs and bake bread. Children can compare the food Jamie eats with the food they eat - some of it the same, like buckwheat pancakes and blueberry muffins, and some of it different, like rabbit stew and duck pie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1M92xs9glvOhMOj5ctjzivDaTaY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jamie Really Liked to Eat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
