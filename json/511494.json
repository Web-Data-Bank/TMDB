Escher: Sky and Water 1","overview":"The art of M.C. Escher (Dutch printmaker) never fails to facinate and astound. M.C. Escher: Sky and Water 1/M.C. Escher : l'air et l'eau 1 mixes traditional and computer animation -- accompanied by a stunning soundtrack -- to playfully explore and deconstruct the optical illusion within one of the artist's most famous works. A fitting homage to a master on the 100th anniversary of his birth. A film without words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wFMEJcYTUUeqjXKhpuaRNgCDTzO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"M.C.
