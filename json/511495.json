Every year hundreds of men, women and children are wounded or killed by antipersonnel land mines. My Child, My Land denounces the use of this hideous weapon. It particularly denounces the complicity of the industrialized nations. If such a horror exists, it is because someone has invented it, and someone else has manufactured it. Can we imagine such barbarity behind the faces of our neighbour? our father? ourselves? This hard-hitting animation film demands that we ask ourselves these questions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sWyK0T1uvSE9BCM92akacphhDtQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Child, My Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
