An \"under-the-bed\" monster wanders through a slumbering household, wreaking typical monster havoc. First a little girl, then an older brother, and finally the teenaged big sister. It's surprising, to both the monster and to us, what frightens each of them. A film without words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4h1cYJqO7hBPotKisDhzTnIKatB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Monster's Calling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
