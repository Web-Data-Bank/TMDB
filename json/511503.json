This fragrant light in a revolving diamond-shaped bottle takes us through space and time, over a reinvented urban landscape where Hong Kong shows the way to Shanghai, while the photographer's inner city gives us a glimpse of the 21st century metropolises.  But this is not history, it's a story where light and shadows fight for territory on shifting battlefields, his and ours. Film without words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m2bYi25lgN9VPmk2Zy1YSPdnBFh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parfum de lumière","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
