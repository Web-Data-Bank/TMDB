To be eaten or not to be eaten: that is the question for a ginger cat, a goldfish and a colourful parrot which a tender-hearted pirate tries to get to live happily together along with his hungry crew. We can only wonder who will be the next meal on this ship of food.  As the ship pitches and rolls to a sprightly gypsy tune, the cat relentlessly pursues the goldfish, and even the parrot gets into the act. But who is predator and who is prey? Everyone ends up down someone's gullet. Isabelle Favez's colourful and humorous film is a tasteful reminder that we're all links in the food chain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jOlUkEhsl20r5bhZXgNRZ5DH68b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":8212,"logo_path":"/pkWt7XNwx5GssnXmTsXLKNpalaH.png","name":"Folimage","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circuit marine","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
