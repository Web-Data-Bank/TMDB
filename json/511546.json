While investigating a residential hotel in San Francisco’s Latino Mission District, Morales finds himself face to face with corruption at City Hall and the mysterious Sofia Nido, a beautiful flame from his past. Morales must also confront his own demons while investigating the crime and ends up caught in a dangerous web of deceit, as he gets drawn into the seedy underworld of bribery, corruption and murder. This independent Neo-noir feature film, based on a story by San Francisco Poet Laureate Alejandro Murguia, takes viewers deep into neighborhoods and communities seldom seen on film, while addressing issues around gentrification and displacement of low-income communities along the way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/35b9VXxZwbtwM9D0KxO7UMbGqGq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Barrio","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
