Their journeys take them on road trips to meet with their past and with relatives who they believe can help them achieve their dreams. Immigration has been shown in many ways, but it has never been presented through the lives of Mexicans and Americans who live similar situations due to poverty and lack of family structure. To achieve a dream you first need to know the name of the dream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1kpvO1iuRrVxiBVh1qm0dQQcLbj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To achieve a dream you first need to know the name of the dream.","title":"Siblings","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
