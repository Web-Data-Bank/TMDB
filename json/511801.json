ULAM: Main Dish stages this new culinary movement as not only a remarkable achievement for American restaurateurs, but also as a validation of Filipino culture. The film confronts issues inherent in representing both Filipino and American identity, and challenges from both the Filipino community and the world at large. Ultimately, ULAM is a celebration - and confirmation - that Filipino food, and Filipinos, are here to stay.","popularity":0.755,"poster_path":"/5hZKX3eUqFDNDWBwGWYOumo7wky.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111185,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kidlat Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ulam: Main Dish","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
