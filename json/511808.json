Their owners teach them the choreographies of police work: biting and letting go, following and staying, always on their owner's command. Longingly gazing upwards, the dogs seem intimately connected with their owners. They are tamed and domesticated; their life is directed by humans. At the same time they are always the elusive other. A gap divides humans and animals, and from the other side these dogs see us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nwyw6POgQHIjCSYnFtJoLcl5NfY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2018-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dog's Luck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
