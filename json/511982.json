We made a plan to share with each other all the rolls of all the sunsets we'd never put into our films. That was November of 2015. By June of 2016, Peter was gone. We never had the chance to exchange our sunsets, but in the 72 hours after his passing, I composed this film, made of up some of the elements about which he cared so much: sea and sky, water and light, boats making for the horizon. In memory and in celebration. - David Gatten","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uXUOGNkhOB4SMGWgefPZb8rrWF2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Narrow Rivers, Open Seas & Seventeen Sunsets (Silences for A Merchant Mariner)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
