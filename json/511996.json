Light Licks are a series of films I began in 1999. The films are made frame by frame, often by flooding the camera with enough light to spill beyond the gate into the frame left unexposed. Light Licks are ecstatic flicker films inspired by jazz and mystic visionary practice, and extend my interest in the ways film can be a medium of visual improvisation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2b1Y0d4yBw576gpPXWMUiHg89f4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light Lick: Amen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
