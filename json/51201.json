A sort of tradition that ends in a karaoke party. Then one summer, a family friend brings her reticent 'city boy' nephew, Kevin, and his pet budgerigar. Olle accidentally releases the bird and what follows is a discovery of friendship and love between the guy who has grown up in a loving environment and simply accepts love for what it is and the guy who's apparently been burned too many times in his own circle to feel comfortable with it.","popularity":1.742,"poster_path":"/cizTZPDGgiI08dJKyEJeHWUEXtS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Migma Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i VÃ¤st","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2007-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucky Blue","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":30}
