Kicking off at the point of relationship meltdown, we follow 20-somethings Emily and Ray as they traverse the uncomfortable world of the newly single. From weird new housemates to a disastrous one-night stand, terrible jobs and creepier dudes, filmmakers Caitlin Farrugia and Michael Jones utilise naturalism and improvisation to explore a relatable slice of life. Shot in Melbourne, this study of fresh singledom captures the grinding pain and quiet triumph of rediscovering who you are outside of a relationship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dWU1pjKymKVv4FW7Ysb0u8v6Wot.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Long","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
