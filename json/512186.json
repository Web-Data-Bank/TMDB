This movie was produced to honor the 50th anniversary of the bookâ€™s 1967 release.  Filmed entirely in Romania, including in the very prison where Pastor Wurmbrand endured torture and solitary confinement, this powerful film uniquely presents the story with live action rather than interviews. The dialogue is presented in English, Romanian and Russian (with English subtitles) to hold to the authenticity of this true story.","popularity":1.841,"poster_path":"/gu0i3ctqs1AZkoA7I4QJULQutfd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37473,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grooters Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2018-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tortured for Christ","video":false,"vote_average":9.167,"vote_count":6}
