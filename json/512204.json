After years of attempting to heal from the actions of an abusive grandfather, Rosskam presents a series of interviews and conversations, including with his own parents, that examine the ways in which trauma encrypts in uncanny ways; the function of speech and narrative in the process of decryption; and the role of film and filmmaking in the practice of healing. Visuals ranging from the vast American west to 16mm ink drawings show the journey Rosskam takes, from trying to reconcile with his reticent father to the realisation that he must confront another, deeper fact about the nature of the abuse. With the support of his partner Alex, Rosskam unfolds a family history creased with complicated understandings and expressions of love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nHrKNqy6ybIMc2AhXyDLy0GukZR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paternal Rites","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
