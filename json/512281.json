In them, she details the trials and tribulations of raising 16 children in rural Quebec, while helping to run a family carpentry business. Through inventive and playful techniques, Giguère brings the stories alive, applying creative approaches to family photographs, archival footage and staged reenactments. He mixes his mother's stories with his own memories and those of his siblings, some of whom hear for the first time what their mother had to say about them. Through these intertwining stories, the film presents not only a testament of a mother's complicated love for her many children, but also offers an intimate look at 1950s working class Quebec.  - Aisha Jamal (Hot Docs Film Festival)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kiJ5p4d14JA3aQD6WBFjjnYYZxO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions du Rapide-Blanc","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Mother's Letters","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
