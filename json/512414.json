The Danube determines the days of the plants and animals living here: it simultaneously provides, protects, threatens, builds and destroys. The meeting of the forest and the river creates a perfect habitat for its residents: the Gemenc floodplain forest is home to deer and wild boar herds, eagles, jackals, beavers, herons, kingfishers, as well as one of the biggest populations of protected black storks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/58m2SFO4mcK3ORS9Pe1e4bQNZld.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pannonia Entertainment Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gemenc - Árterek világa","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
