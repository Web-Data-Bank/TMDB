A constant contrast between a violent and a domestic world, in which violence, humor and irony, give a new layer to the social and moral conflicts of the characters. A lost house in a forest, an underground bar, a prison, a bus, fields and highways, are the spaces on which thieves, truckers, cooks and hookers collide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vGmTkk92L7QruiL8gRqCaEvAjB7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
