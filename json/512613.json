He is well known for his majestic buildings in Europe and Asia that rise with nature inspired geometry and complex shapes that could belong in a fantasy. Nobody knew how to build this project until a team of Mexican constructors accepted the challenge after two years of nobody stepping up to it. But there was a catch. They only had 27 weeks to build something comparable to the Guggenheim in NYC. This is the story of that team who tested the Mexican genius to solve a complex puzzle told by the men and women who made it. On time. On a budget. Against all odds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jNdxcFmtGHixV2miP1criw5m8kQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumática Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2016-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mexican ingenuity deserves a museum","title":"No Further Instructions","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
