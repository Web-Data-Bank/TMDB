They have no names. And they are in a constant run. The mother runs away from the daughter in an attempt to start new life, and the girl runs after her mother as she has no idea how to live without her. This endless run is full with repeated mistakes and resembles a barrel-organ sorrowful song or a spinning-top rotation. This small ridiculous toy \"volchok\" was the first toy in the girl's life, the only thing that tied her with the mother.","popularity":3.277,"poster_path":"/oJUeKQOXymyZFykm3ANAMQm44zH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Koktebel Film Company","origin_country":""},{"id":3419,"logo_path":"/byrxE2pJD9JLyBCIzyK0pYVanyG.png","name":"Central Partnership","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":15755,"logo_path":"/cZDbkvJPOnzHlmu2CDx05DcEnaf.png","name":"Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2009-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolfy","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":20}
