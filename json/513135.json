A non science-fictionalized outer space. It is a space of fantasized stars and galaxies, black holes and light particles. It is a space of hypnotic contemplation and dissociation of the subject from the self. Immersion into macrocosmic vibrations, rotations, contractions, into slow and curved time patterns. Non linear, non climactic time. Outer-inner skies.","popularity":0.888,"poster_path":"/1LwO8iiFd9fRhSxdbtTiWt28Zw4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98568,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.S.T.A.R.T.I.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quasar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
