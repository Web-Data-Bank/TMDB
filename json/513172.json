As she lovingly stated in her autobiography, “I don’t know if it was the climate, the men, or the music, but as soon as I set foot in Spain, I had a crush on this country.” In this documentary by Sergio Mondelo, the filmmaker explores the motivations behind this move and contrasts Gardner’s glitz and glam lifestyle with the hardships faced by the Spainish people under Franco’s rule.","popularity":1.665,"poster_path":"/oeMG43XNGjjIQ8FDkvDvBTgq9LF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moto Films","origin_country":""},{"id":11779,"logo_path":null,"name":"Page 114","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The spanish years of The Barefoot Contessa","title":"Ava Gardner, the Gypsy of Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":7}
