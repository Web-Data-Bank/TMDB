It is the last film in which M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar acted.  The film was produced by M. A. Venu under the banner Muthiah Pictures. By the year 1959, M. K. T. Bhagavathar requested M. A. Venu to produce a film. M. A. Venu agreed and started producing this film. However, M. K. T. Bhagavathar died while the production was half way. So, the crew adapted the story and completed the film.  Bhagavathar could not sing at this time. He told the producer that he has some songs recorded earlier for another film 'Rajayogi' that was never produced and told the producer to use those songs. So, the songs that took place in this film were recorded long before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kiUH5nc6CFU66s7NOppT0DQi4sF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102402,"logo_path":null,"name":"Muthaiah Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1960-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sivagami","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
