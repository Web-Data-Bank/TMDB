Up and coming screenwriter Chip Long and his understudy, Zane, contrive a new narrative that will soon throw the two actors into a fictional maelstrom of fistfights, chases, vigilante priests, nun assassins and underground metal. As Ginger resists the urge to sign with Chip at Sean's insistence, Sean becomes a scribe of his own to enter battle with Chip over an epic yet impromptu script spanning from Texas to Disneyland. As the writers come head to head via their competing visions, only one author can claim victory as real bodies begin to pile up and fact and fiction become more and more blurred in this darkly comical and fantastic adventure.","popularity":0.735,"poster_path":"/msFWKVAr7PK7Tp6WlxUeDzUyELV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Dogs Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero to Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
