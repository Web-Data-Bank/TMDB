His dream of becoming a musician did not come true. He doesn't have a job, he has no plans for the future and has just been given up by his girlfriend. Looking at the rusty skeletons of the ships in the Harbour, he is kidnapped by an hypnotic sound: an ancient musical instrument, the Jew's harp, seems to indicate a way.
