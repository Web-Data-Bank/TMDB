But there are two humans that put the bilby first and have gone on to capture the imagination of their local community, politicians, government bureaucrat and the wider population because they have single handedly turned the tables on an almost extinct species.  Candy company Darrell Lea contributes a percentage of sales to Save the Bilby Fund, ($185,000AU to date) and the sanctuary has been built thanks to the chocolate eating Australian public and The Bilby Brothers, who have spent practically every waking moment of the past decade working to save this little oddball from extinction. Their work is a phenominal example of how one person CAN make a difference.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9bRz27BLNYyi2ScPorHHS5mLRA2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gulliver Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2002-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The men who killed the Easter Bunny","title":"Bilby Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
