The film is situated in a sanatorium where Anna’s dreams and memories are juxtaposed with events at Anna’s home, where she has two children. In the meantime, a special yet doomed relationship develops in the clinic between the young women and Leonore, one of the nurses. Much of the film was re-shot a second time from a monitor, for which the director developed a special camera. In addition, van Houten thought of a way to filter the images of Anna’s memories and re-scanned them to make the newly created images reminiscent of paintings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2001-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Exposition of Anna Zharkov","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
