On a summer Alpen meadow, he patiently constructs a track of about ten thousand wooden slats. Thanks to the stop motion technique, his camera takes us on a thundering journey through the mountain landscape. The soundtrack provides an Olympic atmosphere. With a flashy parody of the ride film to boot. And a curious example of land art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/chWImiATIAdmWE1Tic8ARauElg1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2000-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobrennen im Sommer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
