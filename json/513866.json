This is an amazing in-depth piece and it's notable how many women were involved in this production, from several Lionsgate executives to novelist Suzanne Collins herself. Jennifer Lawrence talks about her \"hypocrisy\" in not wanting to do a big budget blockbuster after having devoted herself to indies (despite X-Men, which she seems to discount somewhat). There's also a nice sequence on the strength and weight training the actors went through and the stunts that are so notable in the film, as well as having to dance around the violence implicit in the story due to the planned PG-13 rating the filmmakers were aiming for.","popularity":1.869,"poster_path":"/ywsHEFrwxshTqG4fk96wO8LIxta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Off the Cliff Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World Is Watching: Making the Hunger Games","video":true,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":4}
