Hollywood movies are re-edited to find the truth behind the relationships between the heroine and the “other woman.” Dykella and Dykenna chew over lesbian vampire stereotypes. And gossip columnist Lady Manilla Lively gives the inside scoop on lesbians in today’s Hollywood. DRY KISSES ONLY tells a story at once obvious and long-overdue, affirming the validity of lesbian readings of popular culture and the tenuous truths of gossip.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zUhyuEgp9iXFxW9sSVBhrVPPgk9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dry Kisses Only","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
