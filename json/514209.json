Everything suggests that the austerity cure has succeeded and that calm has returned. This film proves the opposite. In Thessaloniki young people prevent auctions of foreclosed homes. In Crete peasants oppose the construction of a new airport. In Athens a mysterious group worries the power by multiplying the sabotages. In the neighborhood of Exarcheia threatened with evacuation the heart of the resistance welcomes the refugees in self-management. A trip to music among those who dream of love and revolution.","popularity":1.129,"poster_path":"/1waC0WY2A6osbp8iA0wZNsBObeS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2018-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
