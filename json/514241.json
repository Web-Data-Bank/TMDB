The diaries are a microscopic look into the contemporary landscape of adolescence; sexual confusion, dubious antics, and existential angst. Mad is the center of her single mother, Iris' struggle to parent and produce a living, as a visual artist. This pursuit often includes Mad and her friends' participation in the creation of Iris' edgy paintings. Iris is the eccentric, breezy mom every kid wants. Mad's reality is shattered when she discovers that Iris has a serious illness. Forced into adulthood, Mad grapples with these harsh circumstances as her friends rally around her. They accompany Mad on her journey, inspired by the links she uncovers to her mother's surprising past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vD1BMtN8LmWGX6n8XoCEfNztPHs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102664,"logo_path":null,"name":"McMahoh Lichte Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waking the Wild Colonial","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
