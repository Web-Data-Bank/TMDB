The animation consists solely of a shoe shine: hands move a length of cloth around and across a shoe, syncopated with a minimalistic melody and lyrics written by the artist. Its swaying, repetitive quality draws the audience into a simple and elegant comparison of artistic labor, in the form of drawing, to the marginalized service economy of a global city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c4N38nTprbEcM3PtYbmto3na3kh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2008-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bolero (Shoe Shine Blues), 1996-2007","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
