Presented in a live news format, the story begins in an Irish future where Martians are living with the Irish. Temperatures are boiling and the recession is at its worse.

A live news crew are recording his every word and all sorts of 'spin doctors' and 'know-it-all's' are in the studio using the possibilities of Armageddon as a platform to 'plug' their books and careers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2Y9eKN2xz1s0eI6Pgs7QaAusGYl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The future is here!","title":"Invasion Ireland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
