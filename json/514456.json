In the far future a law is passed enabling citizens to serve out sentences for crimes they intend to commit, serving the full term, but with a 50% pre-criminal discount. Post-criminals and pre-criminals alike are sent to carry out hard-labour on hellishly perilous, far-flung Convict Planets. Few return. Those pre-criminals who are not killed, drop out before their terms are up, with nothing but scars and nightmares to show for their troubles. Two pre-criminals however manage against all the odds to serve out two full terms for murder, and return to Earth as minor celebrities, with the right to kill one person each.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xsCM1q91Q8CBnJvbEXVjgy9USgV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1971-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Med rett til å drepe","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2}
