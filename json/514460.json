There are many floors, dusty nooks and crannies, and forgotten storerooms where he can secret himself. He believes he has found the peace and serenity he seeks--away from humankind--in order to write his poetry. To his initial horror, he finds he is not alone. There are Others who have also sought refuge in the dark places of the department store. He quickly finds himself at the mercy of this clandestine social underclass, for none may leave and risk exposing those who have spent years in the store. What quickly evolves is a chilling tale involving the poet and a young woman who had lost her way in the store while a mere child, and who has since spent her entire life as the downtrodden handmaid to the evil matriarch who rules her clan with an iron fist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dvgQlkVHE49yW0dZylIb7tZOZMx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1970-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nattmagasinet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
