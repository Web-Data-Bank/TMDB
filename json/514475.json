In solitary confinement for the last 25 years, Kenneth has pushed back the walls of his cell to become a painter, a poet, the founder of a non-profit, and an art event organizer - while fighting at the same time for justice. At age 18, Kenneth Reams was convicted for capital murder without firing a bullet. He became the youngest inmate on Arkansas death row. Alongside art, the film shows how love can cross barbed wire and the length of an ocean in Kenneth's love for Isabelle, a French artist who wants to become his wife.","popularity":0.858,"poster_path":"/5d19jjbHNvwVVhpbSWJzXbpssAf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85595,"logo_path":"/b7WeslTaEl82WgOywyfWMDwXkWX.png","name":"Intermezzo Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
