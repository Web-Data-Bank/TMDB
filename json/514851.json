There is a book entitled \"How I Will Be Rich, the Idea Publishing Company\" for a \"great success\". Well, if you have the right luck to sell your Boldizsár, you already have a high-ranking bookstore job. His good or bad fate brings him to the Counts of Nyulassy. But in vain, enthusiasm, if there is a lack of fitness. The Nyulassy family, wishing to maintain the semblance of wealth, completely devastates it. The Countess only takes his book and gets his money on a card, Count Fricie does a little more: steals and sells Boldizsár's car. Countess Dora even exceeds this.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/gpC0zzQLBtXgasHQqXfBAyX7io6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1942-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A tökéletes család","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
