The protest music against the dictatorship was monopolized by the Canto Nuevo groups until punk broke out. With interviews with members of Fiskales ad-hok, Dadá, Pinochet Boys and Políticos Muertos, among others, Pank responds to the need to recreate an aspect of our recent history, whose precariousness and effervescence prevented it from being documented at the time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eSlfoPjcQm9HQNQfWi7sir78eCo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruin It Yourself","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2010-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pank : Origins of Punk Music in Chile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
