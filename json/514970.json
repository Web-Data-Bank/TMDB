A designer with the golden touch - such a genius that he could cross the US by air, rail, or road, stylishly seated in a plane, train, or automobile he'd designed himself!  French designer Raymond Loewy was a star when the American Way of Life was at its flamboyant capitalist peak. He styled his own destiny as a Hollywood thriller. After all, he was a tycoon, a New York celebrity. Yet by the end of his life, he’d been forgotten. He took the mystery of his iconic Coca-Cola bottle to the grave with him. The bigger they are, the harder they fall: One day, megalomania got the better of Loewy, and he came to a tragic end. Suspense, drama, twists of fate: Loewy invented the medium as the message.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1LXakc7otsc5Ws5vcXLroHZFDPc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raymond Loewy, le designer du rêve américain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
