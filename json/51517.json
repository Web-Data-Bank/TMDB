The bomb has dropped, and in the blink of an eye, America has been plunged back into the Stone Age. Money is worthless, food is scarce, and those who once thought they were fortunate to survive the initial attack are now slowly being consumed from the inside out, the victims of an all-consuming nuclear scourge. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","popularity":0.7,"poster_path":"/6sLYK1Jtu30jyjNuVJtnhBwLuEK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The beginning of the end","title":"Deadland","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":8}
