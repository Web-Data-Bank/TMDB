The film follows a cross-carrying fundamentalist preacher, a moralizing youth choir leader, an agenda-filled mega church pastor, and a compelling array of urban and rural born-again believers. All believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible, and share a desire to prepare themselves and the world for the biblical End Times. In its pursuit to present this world authentically, Good People Go to Hell offers fresh and valuable insight into conservative evangelical Christian belief and its connection to the essence of American identity and doctrine in the 21st century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ePH9TCovLfPgHoaYWFwj7KyTwyK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good People Go to Hell,  Saved People Go to Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
