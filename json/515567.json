Haunted by that history, and in the context of the recent rise of the far-right and the tragedy of Grenfell, Jay Bernardâ€™s film Something Said, and their award winning poetry both undertake a queer exploration of black British history, starting with this particular moment in time and examining its ramifications at two scales: the larger social and political rupture that followed the fire, and the smaller, individual attempt to reconcile one's queer present and the black radical past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something Said","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
