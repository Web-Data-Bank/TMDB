During that time, many are forced to abandon dreams of having children, to leave careers they love and to watch their personal relationships suffer. They’re regularly told (erroneously) that pregnancy & hysterectomy are cures and that pain is normal or in their heads.  It’s time to break that cycle. It’s time for a normal that doesn’t mean multiple doctors, surgeries, misdiagnoses and years of pain.  The only film of its kind, Endo What? gives you an accurate, up-to-date base of knowledge straight from the experts – a vital resource missing until now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9RCQubCw4DQIjVdAnRpTjRuMveN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Take it & take control of your life","title":"Endo What","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
