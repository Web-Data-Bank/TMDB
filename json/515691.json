At night, I wander through the streets, in search of resemblances, in the faces and the bodies of others. For whom do I close my eyes at night? A phantom image, a single face that is not there. I show a world that is not mine, that is not real. The image carries my words, words that are eroded. What can I tell, close to the places that I do not show you?” (MC)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un Seul Visage (Some came here to hide)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
