As the series routinely took the format of filming scenes in chronological order, this adds to the \"show within a show within a show\" format of the film, as viewers watch the cast perform the episodes live. The film itself ends with a \"curtain call\", as the cast comes out and Arnaz thanks the audience for their support.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/72gJukIW8hfYSyippgd7pf2AcbP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Love Lucy: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":5}
