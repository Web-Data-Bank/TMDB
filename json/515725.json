The front door slams as Don moves out, and the following days sees Lillian, selfish and irresponsible, having to earn her keep by cooking for Julia, a reclusive, distrustful writer who rarely emerges from her room. Though communicating largely through notes, the odd couple gradually forge a bond and help one another to negotiate the foibles, phobias and obstacles that have long hindered their happiness.","popularity":3.111,"poster_path":"/pdybpTezg2lqOdZF7cCu7c3Dxxl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137864,"logo_path":"/nLIaHSqEw1RZDLdGUO7jTjE30Sn.png","name":"Talland Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":150823,"logo_path":"/bYgS8TKEdFJdxO4mubLneeMw2uS.png","name":"Northern Stories","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":150825,"logo_path":"/q3cM00rxvGzMv2W9jeyACrkpSWk.png","name":"Two Flowers and a King Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":150826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Looking for Levi Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Posture","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":12}
