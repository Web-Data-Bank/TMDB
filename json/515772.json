And the ailing Northern Fleet was sunk here along with a no longer usable nuclear submarine. To this day it lies rusting on the bottom of the Arctic next to two other boats that have sunk in accidents, together with dangerous radioactive nuclear weapons. They form an atomic time bomb, even if official Russian authorities stubbornly deny an acute danger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cWrTyzDzC1Qn05SSUQFQIgxpt9a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99085,"logo_path":null,"name":"SWR/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atomfriedhof Arktis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
