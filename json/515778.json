Even as adults, few of us forget our score, or how we felt about what it took to earn it.  The Test & the Art of Thinking traces the history and evolution of the SAT/ACT as a major player on the pathway to higher education in America, and it documents its current power in our culture. In so doing, it strives to support individuals who are embarking on the road to college, by examining what the SAT/ACT measures and means, and asking a range of educational leaders, admissions professionals and stakeholders in the test—from tutors to parents to test designers—to grapple with the test’s use, ramifications and future.","popularity":0.961,"poster_path":"/bJ8SKI8I0aBCTDVic4suY0rI1nD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Test and the Art of Thinking","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
