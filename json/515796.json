Today, we do know a lot about the brain, but curiously we don't use our knowledge to raise our children, or educate them. Schools are still the same, parents have the same doubts and make the same mistakes. Knowing what is happening in our children's brains change the paradigm, and force to think about education in a more enlightened way. From emotion to mindsets, BRAINIOUS resonates also with our inner-child, and probably helps us to understand better the grown ups we've become.","popularity":1.219,"poster_path":"/omqVySPnd7qEel9vM5zk7vusVjw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brainious","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
