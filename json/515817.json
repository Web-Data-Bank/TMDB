In the embattled provinces surrounding Kruger National Park, South Africa, a network of individuals risk their lives everyday to save the planet's last remaining black and white rhinos - including a Zulu bush tracker, the world’s largest private rhino owner, a frontline anti-poaching unit and a non-profit organisation striving to empower local communities. As poachers continue to destabilise their environment, VESTIGE investigates the gripping realities of human life and philosophy amid a disappearing species.","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/styyWysUY5SX0FR7JPhn5T5SYRy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is not about them; it is about us as humans.","title":"Vestige","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
