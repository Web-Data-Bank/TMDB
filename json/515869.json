By the 1950s, the \"peep show\" traded exclusively in erotic films. For the cost of their spare change, patrons could view short \"loops\" starring beautiful women in a variety of situations in which they inevitably ended up nude. Made cheaply, the stars of these films remain mostly unknown, even if their measurements do not. Looked at today, these films offer a unique look at the challenges faced by women in the Fifties and Sixties, like having to iron your underpants completely naked.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden Cinema: Volume 18 - Ultra-Rare Blue","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
