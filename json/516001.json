What becomes apparent is the humor possible in material interactions and the tender and sometimes melodramatic symbolism of cut flowers. What begins as a reverence for natural beauty ends up pointing towards the abstract expressionism and color field work of high modernism which, in many cases eschewed the banality of such 'natural' beauty. The collaged soundtrack suggests weightier concerns, gently insistent behind the flatness of the utilitarian sounds of ripping tape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d0cKtrzFmq71QAomJU27yGZYNAr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 peonies","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
