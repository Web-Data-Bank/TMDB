Reassurance or validation is sought from anywhere we can find it; at least for that bit confidence to move forward. Building on experiences, exploring new environments, adapting to the unfamiliar, all becomes part and parcel of progress.  But what if it all gets too much? Finding yourself and fitting in, compromise and keeping up?  Sometimes you just need to pull yourself out of it, appreciate the people around you, and enjoy every moment.
