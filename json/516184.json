The large camera was OK, but it was too big to carry along on walks. It didn't have legs so that I could lead it around on a leash like a dog. The little camera, on the other hand, was like a baby which could be stowed in my bag. The salesman was surprised when I kissed the baby camera after he handed it to me. I immediately set off on my first stroll with camera. I thought it was great because I could immediately film everything my eyes stumbled upon. The baby camera was like a gun and ready to go after visual prey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2qhArEKOmgTuAzgWXdhYhflK4AG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Block-1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
