He had a dozen friends join him for different sections of the trip, and one friend who joined him for the whole thing: his blue heeler, 10-year-old Genghis Khan. They covered more than 400 miles on their journey, and Ace wore one pair of shoes for the entire trip: Vasque Inhalers. Filmmakers Forest Woodward and Brendan Leonard captured the trip, and Genghis and Ace's special relationship, in the short film \"Ace and the Desert Dog.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cHU7VLgtsZ3W5cTPcxVNyy3z67f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ace and the Desert Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
