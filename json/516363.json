Using satire, the two Andalusian comedians caricature these two new characters, through pride and lack of culture, and make comments about the situation of men, women and the differences that Spain has with the rest of the world. Now, with 40 years on, they pose the following situation: you are a man of forty years who laughs at life, without really having a hard because everything you have had you squandered. The vision of the prototypical, casposa and sister in law of Spain.","popularity":2.322,"poster_path":"/wEYMAYZjNe8XEZIKqAImbzjKqUY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29566,"logo_path":"/wHbtRtUnXGNzX0riQIpq1fcgueq.png","name":"Atresmedia","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":11652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Bros.
