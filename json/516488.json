In the eyes of this artist, humanity is revealed by the most sublime and also the most obscure aspects. The artist creates the possibility of the human being redeemed through self-evaluation.

She is like a revelation of the beautiful through the ugly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wHIbqTLFRpf91IR0knVrEb5xHPA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2014-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conflitos e Abismos: A Expressão da Condição Humana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
