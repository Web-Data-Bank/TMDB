What is a voice without a face, a laugh without perceptible gesticulations, music without visible animation and so, what little magic was left to retain listeners? It is this very space that Vlado Skafar has chosen to portray in his film made with the aid of basic materials. The pictures: shots of landscapes, cities, all very ordinary, of Slovenia. The sound: the kind of night broadcast where listeners are invited to intervene by way of a game: they phone in, ask for advice, complain, chat or try to flirt with the female presenter who remains invisible to the bitter end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aPdE33TnfiILxkh28lYztVyGdvP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Otok","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":54089,"logo_path":"/gAuDLJVyiDjkEMkMrGmfdYaw6OE.png","name":"Gustav Film","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nighttime with Mojca","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
