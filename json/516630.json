Understanding that the shooting could set off a chain reaction of copycat violence across the country, Gannon quarantines his fellow militiamen in the remote lumber mill they call their headquarters. There, he sets about a series of grueling interrogations, intent on ferreting out the killer and turning him over to the authorities to prevent further bloodshed.","popularity":7.948,"poster_path":"/uCyDJGQ54vcCclNqa6nLcSqH3DQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108781,"logo_path":"/kHAIsNbR9DEiupDXYnloc9FyZl7.png","name":"Cinestate","origin_country":"US"},{"id":89122,"logo_path":null,"name":"Look to the Sky Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":12199,"logo_path":"/gYYIgHpgRsyhyUkeFev1GnwBqHb.png","name":"Madhouse Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":86609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Torfoot Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12142,"logo_path":"/rPnEeMwxjI6rYMGqkWqIWwIJXxi.png","name":"XYZ Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":49471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zero Trans Fat Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Standoff at Sparrow Creek","video":false,"vote_average":6.163,"vote_count":86}
