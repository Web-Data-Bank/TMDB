The primary industry is potato farming and John is a picker who lives for the harvests; it is all he has in his life. He yearns for a life that he does not know how to make for himself - a home and family. John exhibits all the signs of someone who has suffered unknown tragedies in his life, but those reasons are hidden from the viewer. While driving back to town on a dark and isolated road, John comes upon a car stopped up ahead. He immediately can see a hose attached to the exhaust pipe. He has come upon a suicide. Suddenly, headlights appear in the opposite direction and John's immediate reaction is to hide, though he has done nothing wrong. That choice leads John to take the body of the dead young woman to a shed in the woods.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tyGVYx1B28oYpbh5rQCy2N93V4Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103122,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broken Spectre","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"isolated and disconnected . . .","title":"Native Son","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
