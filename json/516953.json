Despite being the only Beauty among the four who is not a real historical figure but one conjured by storytelling imagination and embellished by public fascination, her story was nonetheless incorporated by author Luo Guangzhong into his popular and influential novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Her tale is one of Machiavellian intrigue, in which she schemes with her godfather Wang Yun to restore moral order to the land, sowing discord between the corrupt Minister Dong Zhuo and his adopted son Lu Bu, a man of martial and military prowess.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pJllDBAZKSFpWVHtEYpIQG0QbiT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hsin Hwa Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""},{"id":103146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xinhua Production Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1938-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sable Cicada","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
