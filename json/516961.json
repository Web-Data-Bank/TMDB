Tenderly captured by Gilbert, the bonds shown in the film are diverse and layered: from romantic relationships, to friendships, to a recreation of the love between mother and child. Silicone Soul does not allow for its subjects to be easily labeled or judged. Instead, the film is a collection of resoundingly human stories that reflect universal themes—the desire for love, compassion and communication.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vLy1hrCq4ai2qMI8c5o1YN7MnqU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168430,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frozen Feet Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silicone Soul","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
