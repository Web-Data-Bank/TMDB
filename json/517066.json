Diana lives with her mother close to a United States Air Force base. Much of the film consists of her mother berating Diana about not having a boyfriend. When her mother leaves the room, Diana changes into her Wonder Woman costume and admires her reflection in a mirror. What she sees is not Diana Prince, but rather a sexy super-heroic figure (played by Linda Harrison) who proceeds to preen and pose as the song \"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\" plays on the soundtrack.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/uYnljmC20FK7F3hFi7onRYq3bJx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenway Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonder Woman: Who's Afraid of Diana Prince?","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2}
