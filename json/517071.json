Affable and accessible to journalists, he was cripplingly shy and remained inscrutable about his private life.  This film traces his career, from an Edwardian middle class family to his experiences in a German internment camp, with the help of Tom Sharpe , Barrie Pitt , Lady Frances Donaldson , Sir Edward Cazalet and Lt Col Norman Murphy , a Wodehouse scholar who claims to have discovered the origins of Blandings Castle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x2HYByNzyu5JjzkAkGiRGPlLkyA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plum: A Portrait of of the life of P.G.
