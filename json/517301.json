In leveraging the highly interactive nature of 360 VR, my goal was to get the audience a little closer to the psychology of the dead woman. Furthermore, I tried to explore new possibilities in VR movies by using multiple cameras and organizing scenes and cuts in such a way as to move beyond the existing VR films' monotonous one-scene, one-take progression.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xC2SR0yy3OCA1Kwjnl7SmkL7iPR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reawakening of memories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
