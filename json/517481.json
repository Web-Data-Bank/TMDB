It is a strong-willed and thick-tied group. Chellama, a worker in a facility for the mentally-challenged, is also kind of a groupie. Life is all merry and mirth till she espies Lee & co, attempting an assassination of sorts on a Minister. The bid fails, but Chellama is shocked and so are we. Why would this bunch want to take a crack at the murky world of politics and cricket.","popularity":0.913,"poster_path":"/9F52DiIdhughsy49ONJeJKG8b6s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26579,"logo_path":"/hbbfdUnF3crPtkAkpDqHUmTmho7.png","name":"Nathambal Film Factory","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2007-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lee","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
