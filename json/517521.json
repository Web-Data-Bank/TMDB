His wife is running out of life-sustaining medicine, their young daughter is missing in the storm, electricity and phone communication have been cut off, and their food and water are running out. As He Tianying cares for his dying wife, in this isolation and confinement, his conscience starts to emerge.

In a series of flashbacks, he painfully recalls one particular Falun Gong practitioner whom he had been attempting to force to renounce her beliefs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zVFn7f7ITzOYJCxHgFRaJPJfFhC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Requisite Films","origin_country":""},{"id":165770,"logo_path":null,"name":"NTD Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":165771,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Tang Dynasty Films","origin_country":""},{"id":165772,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wildcat Releasing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The darkest moments can reveal the deepest truths","title":"Sandstorm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
