The colors change fluidly and fade and change into each other. A strange technique is used in this film that is not seen in many other films. This image is one that contains images on the top of the screen moving in one direction and images at the bottom of the screen that are moving in the opposite direction. It gives the impression that forces are pulling in opposite directions even though it is a single frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thoughtforms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
