Filmed on behalf of Syrian TV, the accuracy of Malas' light, shadow, silence and soundscape as essential elements of his cinematic language is evidenced here, as well as his interest in the issues of civil war, territorial war and identity destruction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Frn1rGjetcqtMqNtXy1IXayZYS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"1974-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quneitra 74","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
