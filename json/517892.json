She dedicated her post-war life to publicly speaking of her survival to the young generations, so that it would never be forgotten or repeated. Alice and Serena, her daughter and granddaughter, explore how Maryla’s fight against intolerance can continue today, in a world where survivors are disappearing, and intolerance, racism and antisemitism are on the rise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yREdgaa0J2DehkOqLDF3m4GtkeG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
