Weaving stories from eight countries into one global money conversation, it virtually transforms the cinema into a bank. Purely experiential! Who are we when we talk about money? Far from the glamour of distant Wall Street, this is the reality of personal banking, where oneâ€™s life problems become a matter of business. A heartfelt comment on capitalism revealing how the invisible power of money works on all of us, no matter who and where we are.","popularity":0.849,"poster_path":"/sq3Vat7BcTtsu4hsFNFC038yqLR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talking Money","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
