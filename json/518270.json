The higher-ups in Mars want to learn all about that strange commodity, peculiar to the planet Earth, known as \"Love\". Darry soon figures out what makes the world go 'round when he meets the gorgeous Nicole Mirel. A Martian in Paris was obviously inspired by the 1960 American comedy A Visit to a Small Planet, which starred Jerry Lewis. Darry Cowl's imitation of Lewis is passable, but it certainly didn't fool the \"Le Roi Crazy Jerry\" idolators at Cahiers du Cinema and Positif magazine.","popularity":0.701,"poster_path":"/4GXX1TgTQTTnHh0I72x6oO3fCQd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1961-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Martian in Paris","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
