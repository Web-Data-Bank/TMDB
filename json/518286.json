These true contemporary crime hunters have in their crosshairs all those with the blood of victims of conflicts on their hands. Theirs is primarily painstaking legal work, but also the emotionally charged fieldwork of collecting shocking testimonies from victims forever haunted by the ghosts of violence past. This film tells the story of their daily struggle against injustice and impunity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jLYAEuBtaHcuG1pon9AQVmAJY2Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasseurs de crimes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
