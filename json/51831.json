Archeologist Karen Goodleaf is called in to determine the meaning of the discovery. News of the discovery reaches a Middle East monastery where the warrior monks knowns as the Knights Templer - an ancient sect entrusted with protecting holy relics - choose their best pupil, Lukas (Dolph Lundgren) to face the diabolical threat. As Lukas races to New York, an evil Minion seizes Karen and uses its body like a parasite and host. Lukas arrives just in time to rescue Karen and despatch the Minion. The Minion takes hold of another host - revealing that it is immortal. As it cuts a path of destruction through the city, decimating a parking garage and leaving a trail of death, Karen realizes that the Minion can't be killed - but only delayed from finding a new host.","popularity":3.01,"poster_path":"/h3O4P5i1T0qScKRI0qOzIksDuzR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4345,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taurus 7 Film Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":137189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mahagonny Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":50433,"logo_path":null,"name":"Conquistador Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":137190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minion Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the Millenium ends...
