Now desperately clinging to any reminder of the son she held so close to her heart, Camille becomes increasingly fixated on Frank - the young man who was not only her child's best friend, but the one who was responsible for the tragic accident that took his life as well.  At first, Frank is receptive to Camille's advances. It's not long, however, before the pair's scandalous relationship prompts many of Camille's friends to distance themselves from the increasingly unstable woman. Later, as Camille's obsession with Frank turns menacing, the relationship between grief-stricken mother and her guilt-ridden lover begins to take on ominous undertones.","popularity":1.196,"poster_path":"/5qya5NRh8a1bl3i7IOoSR9WQmua.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6941,"logo_path":"/mjl7Tn8vszEPdWIfIg3c6weyjPP.png","name":"Gloria Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":109756,"logo_path":"/sudlIoNIIrKmVWaYD2ZVo9HGogW.png","name":"Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":108769,"logo_path":"/riBQBny2Z3la03Wy8I27Ahn2spC.png","name":"Playtime","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Him","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":15}
