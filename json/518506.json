But even though civilization has been destroyed, there are some things that never change. For instance, the future still seems full of lusciously busty young women who want nothing more than some scintillating sex. Mad Jack, a renegade warrior who's being chased across the barren wastelands by a trio of futuristic government agents, has been off fighting a lengthy war and wants to get back to his home for some rest and relaxation. The agents won't leave him alone, though, tracking him down even as he's engaging a local lass in some steamy sensuality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oHLwtSncg0Ql3atmlmypVQJz6Jc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wet Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mad Jack Beyond Thunderbone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
