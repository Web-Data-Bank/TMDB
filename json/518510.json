Well, kind of. There is a plot of sorts, but this really is more of a compilation disc than anything else. There is plot for each scene, but it’s never part of a cohesive whole. It’s like watching the Club Massacre from the beginning of Blade, the boarding of the plane from Passenger 57, and the final inning from Major League on a Wesley Snipes compilation disc. Is there a plot? Sure, but you don’t see much of it. I’m just going to address the plots in the scene breakdown; it’s really not worth it from here.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ddYEKeI5LIvAhhs3n9nPtS4Sl6Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electric Hollywood","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Inside Ginger Lynn","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
