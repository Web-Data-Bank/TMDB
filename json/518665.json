Long known as a center of drugs and prostitution, and also once home to a thriving Chinese enclave, itâ€™s now peppered with boutique shops, new bars and restaurants and the just-debuted Little Caesars Arena. This feature from noted Detroit artist Nicole Macdonald mixes a personal, journalistic and historic approach as it looks at who and what remains in the Corridor. We hear how residents survived, and how they sometimes didn't, as gentrification redefines the space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pQGEfiGiF2e0OXbk937BfM89DuX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Days of Chinatown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
