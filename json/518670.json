But along the U.S.-Mexico border, nothing is that simple. To build a wall along all 2,000 miles would be an unprecedented feat of engineering, costing an unprecedented amount of money. Traveling by air and by land, investigative reporters embark on a 2,000-mile journey to dissect the issues of Trump's proposed border wall. The journey is filled with the history, heartache and hope that comes from living on one of America's most controversial stretches of land. The film is a collaboration between the Free Press team behind “12th and Clairmount” and fellow USA Today Network journalists at the Arizona Republic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/18IpbRV4nPKzeUYJNBlsJo1x2rc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
