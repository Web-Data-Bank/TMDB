The resilient Detroiters on Wendell’s route share stories of pushing against racial segregation in housing, challenging industrial and political disinvestment and living on reduced pensions as a result of Detroit’s bankruptcy. They also share stories of hope and propose creative ways to re-imagine an inclusive, equitable and productive city. Foregrounding the voices of African-American working class Detroiters, it offers a nuanced and complex understanding of a city at the crossroads.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/drmHa0v3aTVF0gaiKV219OSsT7K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/tpaJr0p9DUCm4xWrdR6YwuI6TjP.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Conversations Along a Postal Route","title":"Detroit 48202","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
