Spencer Yeh's music video for Deerhoof interprets the simple lyrics of the band's song to place its protagonists on a colorful, psychedelic odyssey through videogame-inspired visuals. Animated with sprites that evoke 8-bit graphics, Buck and Judy encounter sundry items like bananas and strawberries, which are often associated with bonus powers in games such as Pac Man. Epic battles on ground and in airship conclude with the heroes in dueling monster outfits. The effect is unbridled pop and digital nostalgia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buck and Judy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
