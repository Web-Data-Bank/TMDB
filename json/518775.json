Ma was about to close the Angela laundry shop for the day when Sham appeared. A young man with a head injury and handful of dirty clothes from his stay at the street during the Umbrella Movement, Sham needs his clothes washed. Full of passion for the social cause, Sham initially chided Ma for staying in the comfort of the shop. However, these two strangers slowly opened up to each other when a number of characters passed by the shop, revealing the tumultuous world behind Ma’s stoic silence. Sham also gained new insight on meaningfulness, which exists not only within a worthy cause but also at seemingly abandoned clothes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angela","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
