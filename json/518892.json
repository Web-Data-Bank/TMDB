Clint, taking on the role of Clint Star, seeks out his far-flung buddies, young Natives like himself. They talk about sex and life... love and abuse... 500 years of oppression--with humour, grace and courage.  Deep Inside Clint Star explores issues of identity, sexuality and intimacy, while retaining the creative and playful style of a director who is not afraid of turning the camera on himself. This engaging documentary will draw you out of yourself and deep inside Clint Star.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8leR82d3rLBmLh1JXVXTfpsxnQV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Inside Clint Star","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
