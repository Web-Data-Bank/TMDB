Crime, lack of opportunity and infrastructure problems still persist. Community Patrol explores neighborhood self-policing through the eyes of Minister Malik Shabazz, a long-time Detroit activist and community organizer. Determined that more black men don’t end up in jail or killed, the minister confronts drug offenders directly rather than reporting them to the police.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9uBeqJ6vuHyyZLlYQEfjXaKgQr9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beachfire Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Community Patrol","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
