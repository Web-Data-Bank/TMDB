It tells the story of Elsie Mae Begay, whose history in pictures reveals an incredible and ongoing struggle for environmental justice. A powerful new epilogue (produced in 2008) shows how the film and Groundswell Educational Films outreach campaign create news and rally supporters including Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA). The Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform mandated a clean-up plan by the five agencies responsible for uranium contamination. Ironically, the US EPA's Comprehensive Five-Year Plan did not include Ms. Begay's backyard, until she travelled with this film to Washington, DC and screened it on Capitol Hill in September, 2008.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rW6ndsbo9DgBGgYVw4S7K4AiQKu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Navajo","iso_639_1":"nv","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Navajo Boy","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
