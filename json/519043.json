He connects with a Freudian psychiatrist who is convinced that his homosexuality stems from an unresolved Oedipus complex which he has repressed by denying his natural attractions to women, to which the psychiatrist's proposed solution is to hypnotize Esther into believing that she is a man so that men will become the gender that sexually repulses Demira; in his career, he is ambivalent when the first \"mainstream\" role he is able to land is a gore film in which he will play the victim of a cannibal family for which Esther has also been cast as the mother.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qiEDRLL6rIcT7zj7ync1DvbRQae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canada Council for the Arts","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother's Meat and Freud's Flesh","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
