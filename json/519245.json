Brought together for a weekend retreat the students examine their deeply held attitudes and feelings about race and ethnicity while exploring the barriers to building a society that truly respects diversity and pluralism. Scenes of their participation in group discussions, as well as personal portraits and views of their lives at home and at college, reveal why racial tension persists and suggest ways of overcoming our countryâ€™s complex legacy of racial injustice, apathy, and alienation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skin Deep","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
