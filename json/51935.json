Frank (Layke Anderson) is a determined English teenager who runs away from high school to find an alternative gay lifestyle in Amsterdam. He finds a home and a job at the \"House of Boys\", a bar-cum-brothel run by a strict Madame (Udo Kier) who has an eye for what his punters crave. Frank works his way up from barman to on-stage dancer and falls in love with some of his housemates Jake (Ben Northover). The first intimations of what is described as 'the gay cancer', casts a long shadow over Frank's tight-knit group of friends. Yet despite the troubles that cloud the hopes and dreams of young Frank, his perseverance, along with support from a willing doctor (Stephen Fry), will carry him through. House of Boys is a glamorous, colourful coming-of-age story that lifts the lid on an exciting world of sex and music, where deep passions suddenly turn into a struggle for courage.","popularity":3.32,"poster_path":"/7nN2PClEfaJ5oddWaCGFPeJZst5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1472,"logo_path":null,"name":"Delux Productions","origin_country":"LU"},{"id":1761,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elsani Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Letzeburgesch","iso_639_1":"lb","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Boys","video":false,"vote_average":6.283,"vote_count":30}
