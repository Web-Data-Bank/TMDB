Growing up, my sisters and I heard voices, saw lights and dreamed of other beings. My mother and I shared a recurring dream of strangers on the driveway, where stonewalls marked the old main road through town. Our dreams and our memories converged into one experience, the experience of living in a haunted house. After the sale of the property in 2001, my recurring dreams returned and the question emerged - were we the ones now haunting the house? When I ask my father about the past, he answers with the Theory of Relativity, the Laws of Thermodynamics, and the speed of light. He dreams of being on a distant star, with a telescope powerful enough to show him how things used to be. Just as we perceive the moon, as it was 1.2 seconds ago and the sun, as it existed 8 minutes ago, great distances allow us an opportunity to look back in time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lpokAWSeaac1xs0yEjxAFFnMvge.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quiet Title","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
