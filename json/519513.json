Axel is 30, has just finished film school, is unemployed and in quick succession, separated from his girlfriend while his grandmother died. His mother, somewhat concerned by her son’s situation, decides to entrust him with a mission: to take the funeral urn of his grandmother to Sweden, her native country. A little disoriented, Axel arrives in the country of his ancestors with just his camera and Anna’s ashes for company. He begins what will become this film, an object that will be everything but a chronicle of the ominous trip. As, on the way, an encounter will completely change the young man’s life: Clara.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/mTiNl71jlINs2HyUHKNJ7STD4Pl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alone with Anna","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
