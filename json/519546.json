Seven years later, he is now a filmmaker, and decides to undertake a cathartic process to attempt to renew the strained links with his mother using his memories. In a cabin in the middle of the countryside, the director and his mother are filmed by a camera, sharing a moment, at once painful and intimate, with the person who is recordingâ€”and thus, later, with those who will watch. At the same time as the huis-clos conserved by this painstakingly composed device, the filmmaker discusses with his sister, trying with her to dissect the past and its traces, to resolve their differences with regard to this same ordeal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hFMAOrhC0QMOYKc3FAFDjaljaKm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103607,"logo_path":null,"name":"ritcs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2018-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Time We Have Left","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
