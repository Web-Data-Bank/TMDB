Today, the mine, which in other times kept its neighbours in employment, is no longer operating. It is difficult to imagine a future for this slightly forgotten land, criss-crossed by ruins that bear witness to a happier era, and virtually abandoned by inhabitants forced to leave to find work elsewhere.  It’s summer, children play in the street, tourists camp next to the river, adults burst into traditional song in the ruins of the mine. Here, everything happens as a community, as if being together was the only possible answer to the question formulated by the film’s title.","popularity":1.349,"poster_path":"/cYbV3gR0dpWSy7wix5HVcw9LyWr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79291,"logo_path":"/xUbb6yEMwXCjdJDEYBQaMssUMrt.png","name":"Uma Pedra no Sapato","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Out There Has It Been Seen?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
