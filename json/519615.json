He lives poorly selling pigs with the only company of thirty dogs, two cats and a sheep in the heart of the Argentinian humid pampa. This year, his only neighbour and friend Hugo has made up his mind to move to the city as soon as the autumn arrives, after spending his whole life in the countryside.  Horacio is deeply affected, and more sensitive than ever about his own solitude. That summer, memories from the past will come after him while he tries to persuade Hugo to stay.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5y8yDBPmzYAZcm5ktBFseJzVPcH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16497,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dedo en el Ojo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man on the Plain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
