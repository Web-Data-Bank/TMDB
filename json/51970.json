After a slew of bad break-ups, Jay gives up white women, \"cold turkey,\" and he goes on a mission: \"Operation Brown Sugar\". But because Jay doesn't fit the \"brotha\" stereotype, he fails miserably with the \"sistahs.\" Then he meets the dynamic Catherine, a misunderstood \"Half-rican Canadian\", who's as righteously quirky as he is. To win her heart, Jay must confront his fears as he realizes commitment is a bigger issue than race.","popularity":2.039,"poster_path":"/uOx0FC10wH8HBmssWE51knqsGNu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not you.
