Directed at thousands of women daily by way of social media, it lies in plain sight, and its ramifications never remain only online. The film deftly depicts not only the forms digital abuse can take, from non-consensual pornography to invasion of privacy, but also the consequences for its victims.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/rSfdsBBU3QkKf8Fm9nTh34SMH6O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13045,"logo_path":"/mBR20RYepv3OrKF7OJYu5EYUt2y.png","name":"Fork Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":24488,"logo_path":"/qR7gDm9nMYdrqnVpksmNMhwI1ZI.png","name":"Women Make Movies","origin_country":"US"},{"id":151270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Train of Thought Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":176799,"logo_path":"/oaclGxyfn94yNVsKaKrvteu9h7C.png","name":"The Harnisch Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Netizens","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
