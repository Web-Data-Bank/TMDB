As her dreams unfold in the liquid medium of the bath, she becomes the ‘eye’ of the story and her own body the object of its gaze. With a feminine hand, THE STORY OF I plucks Bataille’s central metaphor from its original context and re-invents its erotic vision from the inside out. The eye is the vagina, seen throught he blood, urine and tears, it looks at itself in a mirror.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8wEmDhIj72RUfHEWnDZv26upAma.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story of I","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
