Hidden in the straightforward reportage are sly comments on the MTV machine, sexism in the media, and the business of rock-and-roll. Best of all, Huey Lewis and the News maintain their sense of humor even when absurdity threatens to overwhelm them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jVNTLVsfjgwUcWlupWiz131lDYO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Blank Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flower Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Huey Lewis and the News: Before!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
