Maggie, an inveterate social climber, wants to join the prestigious Northchester Hunt Club, and sends them a check for the $38,000 membership fee. When Jiggs finds out, he manages--after a struggle with Maggie--to take care of the check. Consoling himself at his favorite bar, he's convinced by his drinking buddies that the way to make up with Maggie is to buy her a racehorse that is coming up for auction. He does, only to discover that a doctor has told Maggie that her sneezing fits are due to a rare allergy she has--to horses. Complications ensue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/neTV8GyFOrziDbsRdRdk8tAHxl3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jiggs and Maggie in Jackpot Jitters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
