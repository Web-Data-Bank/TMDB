However, additional evidences of the divinity of this book also exist. In this inspiring and informative presentation, Dr. Daniel C. Peterson, a noted scholar and lecturer, provides an intriguing look at the evidences that support the Book of Mormon as an ancient text. He looks at such things as chiasmus, word-print analysis, geographical evidence, and much more as he shares his witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, brought forth by the prophet Joseph Smith. Dr. Peterson's engaging style and convincing presentation will make this video a valuable resource for every gospel library.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lOyoqdcLkZEcliYTqOVC59AEEzi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evidences of the Book of Mormon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
