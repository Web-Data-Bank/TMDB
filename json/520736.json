Additionally, \"Loro\" wishes to tell the story of some Italians, fresh and ancient people at the same time: souls from a modern imaginary Purgatory who, moved by heterogeneous intents like ambition, admiration, affection, curiosity, personal interests, establish to try and orbit around the walking Paradise that is the man named Silvio Berlusconi.","popularity":7.295,"poster_path":"/alZtZ2cOmSen1CCitIsEA0OMVHz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loro 2","video":false,"vote_average":7.204,"vote_count":353}
