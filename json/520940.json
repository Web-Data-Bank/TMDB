The piece plays sort of like a dramatic \"reality television\" program at times, but it's an absorbing look into the wonderful world of animated film creation.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/swl2RlXvMxR65leUva3eJKqixPC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hinako Sugiura-MS.HS","origin_country":""},{"id":119127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sarusuberi Film Partners","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2015-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Making of Miss Hokusai","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
