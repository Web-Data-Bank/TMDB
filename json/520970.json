This is not story about Hades from an ancient history textbook. This is Sankt-Petersburg In mystical literary tradition such as he is. A pomposity, an open space and - deathness. There is no gleam in the sky, Neva looked like poured by a lead, a crude air presses and can not pass through lungs, which are already struck by bacillus Kochii, and there are around ominous frights, threatening to punish for an unknown offence. And even white nights are bad. It looks as if you can meet phantom of a Poet which was tortured at thirtieth years of any of the last centuries. Be careful with monuments. They fond of walk along town quays (as told us Poushkin - he brings luck!). And do not trust this Neva prospectus. City - phantom, evolved from a bog which is refuge of evil spirits. Brilliant St.-Petersburg.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/58MI9ZAl9b9i3KcOwgbpJfwt1gx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lentelefilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phantoms of White Nights","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
