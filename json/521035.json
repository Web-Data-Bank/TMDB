After mixing up the script pages to the various radio programs, Hubert sets out to get the name of a returning explorer on a contract for the radio station.  Other than the title, this film has no connection at all to the 1934 W.C. Fields film of the same title even though some sources give the plot of the Fields' film as the plot of this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4D9nvZaUhnJjNbQp83Qx0TB395t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You're Telling Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
