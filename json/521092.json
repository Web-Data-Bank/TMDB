Olivia, a 28-year-old psychologist, has two obsessions: to save the confectionery of her parents, and to find her ideal husband. At the age of 26, Salma, a fiery young history teacher, still lives with her mother in the suburbs. Their roads have no reason to cross - until the day when, on the death of their biological father that they never knew, they inherit together a splendid Parisian apartment. For these three sisters who have nothing in common, cohabitation will prove to be explosive, to say the least.","popularity":4.138,"poster_path":"/iQwBOtpMu2wDqT0PdGi3dv5M56j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2902,"logo_path":"/vFmmYSgFp8eE6C34JVCXy9bJFmc.png","name":"SND","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Empreinte Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demi-sœurs","video":false,"vote_average":6.039,"vote_count":178}
