This is how the author sees this annual hustle and bustle and weaves an equally bizarre event around it, which focuses on the love of a Munich exterminator for the daughter of a Saxon high school teacher. He equips the story with a monstrous inventory of secondary characters, who provide plenty of linguistic and social misunderstandings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tOeXx7W692RWhhyGODbfMekj0md.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66769,"logo_path":null,"name":"DÃ¼rer-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1968-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"'S Wiesenhendl","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
