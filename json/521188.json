His daughter Theresa longs for a red dress from France that she believes will give her power and strength, as the bear claw once did for her great-grandfather Muskwa. When Theresa escapes an assault and Kelly turns his back on his daughter, he realizes that he must reconnect with his culture in order to make things right. Today, the red dress is a powerful symbol recognizing over 1000 missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7TLHOWxBlWGFVDVNbUyaL00Svvr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Dress","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
