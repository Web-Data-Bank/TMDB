We saw him actor in \"A pocket love\" and \"The Bel Age\", Pierre Kast, in \"Dangerous Liaisons 1960\", Roger Vadim, where he held the role of Prévan, which was like a glove . His friend Prévert had designed him the cardinal's role in \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" by Delannoy. But never did Boris dare to put on the stage what he had written for the screen: he believed the thing impossible. An episode from the tv-mini-series  \"Collection rue des ravissantes: Boris Vian fait son cinéma.\"","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/ozFoJ5oWF2KW4758Gx0UI0RrRqC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Faust","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
