Featuring Star Wars ripoffs, Star Wars TV specials, Star Wars commercials, Star Wars interviews and even shameless Star Wars pornography [rated R].  It’s Star Wars gone wild, gone weird and gone wrong, and there’s nothing else like it.  C-3PO rapping?  It’s here. Mark Hamill turns into a homicidal maniac?  Yep, we got it.  Jabba the Hutt Italo disco? Check. Tusken Raider Voyeur Pornography? Oh yeah, and lots of it. You’ve never seen Star Wars like this and you’ll never see Star Wars quite the same way after watching.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/50Xf9wCG3OK2xvaEnZO7ZcmlPCa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star Wars Nothing But Star Wars","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2}
