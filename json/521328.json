Jules seems a little too close to his mother and distant from his father, who wants Jules out of their Parisian house. It's to be a summer of transition, perhaps to a boarding school, and during these weeks in the country, Jules fishes with his grandfather; proves himself to the local youths, a group led by the bullying Red; takes on some tough guys; feels rejected by his mother; and, meets and pursues Evelyne, the village beauty. She's responsive, and Jules doesn't exactly know what to do next. Then, something happens that propels Jules into decisiveness and maturity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lyxAxxwXvASvn6whNMcqBsDswfZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baccara Production","origin_country":""},{"id":875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films A2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Ariane","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":109756,"logo_path":"/sudlIoNIIrKmVWaYD2ZVo9HGogW.png","name":"Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Country Years","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
