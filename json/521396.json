The documentary takes us behind the record production, where artists and musicians like Quincy Jones, Kenny Barron, John Pisano or Peter Erskine are telling their own story about Jimmy Scott. We get a look behind the scenery and find out how this record is carried out. This Making-Of is a moving document about an unknown icon of music history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":103965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kemper Music Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rising Above the Blues: The Story of Jimmy Scott","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
