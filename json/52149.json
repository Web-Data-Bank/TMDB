Can differences of faith stand in the way of an innocent love affair? Two young people, Esma and Mustafa, fall in love. For them, the future only has meaning if they are together. Failing this, life is meaningless. However, overhanging their love is a barrier unique to the period and location: Mustafa is a clandestine Christian, when everyone including Esma thinks he is Muslim. In the meantime, the Ottoman Empire introduces a series of reforms giving Christians the same rights as Muslims. From this point on, the Church urges secret Christians to reveal their faith. This poses a dilemma for Mustafa: he is caught between his love and the Church.","popularity":1.106,"poster_path":"/A9tQvXDDtxsL6tOUu0aAjCxNBAu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2010-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ask Your Heart","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":12}
