Filmed four years before the band's concert film Stop Making Sense, this 80-minute performance was taped in stark black-and-white at Passiac, New Jersey's Capitol Theatre on November 4, 1980. The show came less than a month after the quartet released their landmark Remain in Light, and five of the gig's 14 songs are culled from that album.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yb8ACzB6OwVqtfy9yZAbBl1BtSW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talking Heads: Capitol Theatre","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
