The theatre with its red velvet warm lighting, resembles an oversized music box. The camera turns around the dancer revealing the opposite side of the room: an empty and painfully bare theatre.  The ballerina appears as an eerie figure expressing effort, sacrifice and pain in her strive for perfection. Both fragile and cruel. Initially shy and hesitant, her steps become more and more emphatic, menacing and not exempt of violence, scraping and cutting into the delicate surface of the piano with her sharp pointe shoes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wuRipxzVLRVvUDMxkfFyvfIzZAh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Points","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
