The interviews, brought to life through vividly cinematic reenactments, uncover the birth of her fierce commitment to Irish Republicanism. Price revisits the bombing and the 200-day hunger strike that followed, and discusses her role in the disappearances of some suspected Republican informants. With 2018 marking the 20th anniversary since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, and 50 years since the start of the Troubles, filmmaker Maurice Sweeney presents an eye-opening portrait of a once passionate, now disillusioned nationalist whose clarity of purpose both inspired allegiance and promised terror for so many.","popularity":0.921,"poster_path":"/8qufgxFdfH6xqCNM98uXWrHhL82.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2018-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I, Dolours","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":8}
