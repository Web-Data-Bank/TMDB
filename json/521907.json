But he never gets any peace because he lives with a roomful of roommates who are so loud and brash all the time that he cannot concentrate on his work. So he comes up with a story of a ghost, who is an actress and haunts their place. The spirit soon comes to life and has an eerie resemblance to Marilyn Monroe. It turns their life upside down and instead of this apparition helping the director; it distracts him more than ever. He loses all his focus and is not able to complete his script, thereby unable to fulfill his dreams of becoming a successful writer.
