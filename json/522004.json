Damas","overview":"Léon G. Damas (1912–1978) was the first poet to “live Négritude”, according to the Senegalese poet, politician and cultural theorist Léopold Sédar Senghor. Cosmopolitan and always in transit, his writing is a chorus of melodies and imagery imbued with angst and melancholy and strongly influenced by jazz and blues. Punctuated by images of the landscapes of French Guiana and the voice of the artist, the film exemplifies the poetic documentary form to which Maldoror frequently returned.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2mqcNMbgUt8YvyVTKHITNGf3Gp2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matouba Film","origin_country":""},{"id":30710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Conseil Regional de Guyane","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Léon G.
