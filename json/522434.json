From the opening gale-force blast of storm music, through the crunching and stabbing accompaniment of Iago's \"Credo\" to the shimmering strings of Desdemona's \"Willow Song\", he doesn't miss a trick. Everything works at the highest pitch of intensity and the orchestra sticks to his beat like glue. It's a necessary compensation for the shortcomings of the staging: the stolid chorus remains unperturbed by the storm and is directed to perform with unison movements; the acting (apart from Valeri Alexejev) is non-committal, and Alexandre Tarta's video direction somewhat flat-footed. She doesn't manage to make much small-screen sense of an impenetrably murky opening scene, for example, and doesn't seem fond of reaction shots.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":"/fHyWyNd3l8t08mTTGiLzQpv343c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":157,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Otello","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
