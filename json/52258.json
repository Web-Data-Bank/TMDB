He'll swap places with commoner Eugene Lenormand, sneak into Paris, then Lenormand will reveal himself and Napoleon will regain his throne. Things don't go at all well; first, the journey proves more difficult than expected, but more disastrously, Lenormand enjoys himself too much to reveal the deception. Napoleon adjusts somewhat uneasily to the life of a commoner while waiting, while Lenormand gorges on rich food.","popularity":2.703,"poster_path":"/pzxtlEreMpCppSlZpKmJ9ZyWj3M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/e8EXNSfwr5E9d3TR8dHKbQnQK4W.png","name":"Film4 Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":11912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mikado Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":8764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Redwave Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":191,"logo_path":"/d5tPJd8jGLtJC5cp9NG0HeoTyoe.png","name":"Senator Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":109547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panorama Films","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":35}
