Transforming herself into human being, she gets mixed up with crowds of a Halloween matchmaking party in the big city, Tokyo. Coming from rice paddies and feeling isolated from the real human beings, the scarecrow falls in love with a real zombie. They are only real monsters among all, so the scarecrow thinks he is 'different' from others. The zombie has strong sense of justice, and he only eats bad people's bad brains for the world peace. The scarecrow starts to follow the zombie's bad brain hunting. Even though the outsiders nurture love, the time limit approaches to end their happy journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q1KS2i2zDyR6l3EXiLQ8Q08VH8i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Halloween Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
