Micaela, José's Mother, and Mörd (Death) are played by the same dancer. The action is reduced to a single act in 13 scenes. The love scenes are played to a minimum and the working women's fight is adjourned to the last scene [and cut from some DVD editions] that concentrates all the pathos announced throughout by the eerie music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7DR4ajgghHOo4e4g3TWiVFQFYIT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1994-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
