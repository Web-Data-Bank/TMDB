This documentary sound reproduces the critical debate that follows. In June 1969, at the end of the Wrestling Class , Pol Cèbe, the head of the Cultural Center of Palente-les-Orchamps, brings to the sound document a conclusion in the form of a report. Echoing an intense debate after the screening of To Soon I Hope , the movie The Hinge of Medvedkine Groups captures very well those moments when workers express their dissatisfaction with the way they were portrayed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vKy4ulXCZcgqDjfTmHPq9vfKvUG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17043,"logo_path":"/wOBCQfhPuojzf2A0eOzktyjT6JS.png","name":"Iskra","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Charnière","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
