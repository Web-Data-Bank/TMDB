This quartet of hauntologies reframes the cruel reductions of biography to focus on death and doubles. Repurposing archival texts (the diaries of Khalo, the testimonies of Wallerâ€™s kin and familiars) as audiovisual graffiti, old voices are cropped and replayed as intertitles or voice-over fragments, lending a historic charge to images that dream across the present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lZIJUP0PQHRhnRnw2FH8RsEBVRL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aftermath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
