In the meantime, her baby sister, Natsumi (Rio Kanno), grows up to become a very studious and serious 12-year-old, studying hard at her summer juku (cram school).  When her aunt, a free-spirited photographer (Karie Kahimi), goes missing in South America, her mildly scatter-brained mother (Kaho Minami) and father (Tetsuji Tanaka) go looking for her, leaving the girl, Natsumi, to look after her sleeping sibling, Ai (Rosa Kato). Yes, this is a clear case of child neglect, but Natsumi is such a no-nonsense, responsible type that it seems almost understandable. Soon after Mom and Dad leave, she notices that Ai, incredibly, is up and about, with the body of a woman, but the mind of an 8-year-old.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kH29AAFntUZZ8o8P6G0ujptdSm7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ichiban kirei na mizu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
