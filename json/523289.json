But why did this painting fire such outrage? Professor Bettany Hughes embarks on a voyage of discovery to reveal the truth behind the Venus depicted in the painting, proving that this mythological figure is so much more than just an excuse for sensual nudity and chocolate-box romance. Because Venus Uncovered is the remarkable story of one of antiquity's most potent forces. And more than that - hers is the story of human desire, and how desire transforms who we are and how we behave.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3FmegYjGp2SWNpfBnuKhRlMMvuL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ancient Goddess of Love","title":"Venus Uncovered","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
