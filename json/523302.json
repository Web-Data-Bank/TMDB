The characters feature lack of willingness to take any action, they are passive and indifferent, unable to create their own reality. The author presents a world that loses its original shapes and loses its identity. Groaning “oh God” as a main theme combines it all: grimace, sigh and a quiet whisper of despair over our own impotence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/njHAvcim7Ox5lU3CZdN3kls1Sf8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
