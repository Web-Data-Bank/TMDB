Partners Jen and Grant go head to head in a competition to see who can swear off consumerism and produce the least landfill garbage in an entire year. Their light-hearted competition is set against a darker examination of the sobering problem waste in North American society. Even as Grant and Jen start to garner interest in their project, they struggle to find meaning in their seemingly minuscule influence on the large-scale environmental impacts of our “throw-away society”. Featuring interviews with renowned artist, Chris Jordan and marine pollution expert, Captain Charles Moore, The Clean Bin Project presents the serious topic of waste reduction with optimism, humour, and inspiration for individual action.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Clean Bin Project is a feature documentary film about a regular couple and their quest to answer the question \"is it possible to live completely waste free?\"","title":"The Clean Bin Project","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
