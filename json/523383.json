That is because words are certainly not the right instruments to tell us what it’s like to run a marathon. I think we can try to show it through the characters, noises, texts, lights, the absolute physical understanding of shadows and of the sun, the water, the motions and the serenity. For those who do not practice running in marathons because they don’t want to or because they can’t, I wish to bring something from inside the marathon, out; for example, for my Mum, whose legs ache. I am acting like a spy sent into the marathon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/itYFaZiwJFSoBD6XlfOEsUN8R0c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55586,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hargla Company","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forty Two","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
