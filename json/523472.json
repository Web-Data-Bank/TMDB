Afterwards they all leave.  The film was shot in a period of two weeks, with one week of rest in between. Each scheduled day the complete script was played several times again. Such a 'take of the whole script' was only partially shot. [Actually no one of the actors was rehearsed: one learns the text by reading it in action.] This repetition stands in sharp contrast with the fact that the actors and members of the crew create an ad hoc context that never became final. For example: 'this is a visit'. There is an essential correspondence between the situation on the set and the spectator's observation of what happens on the screen later, which is nevertheless also its most distinctive characteristic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Het Bezoek","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
