Living as a collective and as equals in a family-based commune. They are the Hakka from the mountainous region of South East China. Their home is a fortress-like structure called the Tulou, where as many as five hundred family members share an ancient way of life. \"We all live in the same Tulou and we have the same ancestors\" says one 82 year old resident of one of the most beautiful of the Tulous called Tianluokeng \"But the young ones are all leaving to work outside now.\" The Tulou is one of the world's most unique buildings and life in the countryside can be idyllic. But as China modernizes and its cities expand, life in the Tulou is slowly disintegrating. As the young move away to find work, only old family members are left to endure the hardships of rural life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1WB5EfG3YjJit5IJdjfOZXX8bj8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Remarkable Story of an Ancient Civilization's Struggle to Survive","title":"The Last Clan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
