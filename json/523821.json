The people are split between a religious majority, struggling to assert its conservative identity, and a vocal minority determined to make their home in a community afraid of change. Fearing a threat to their way of life, the mayor and city council unanimously approve a resolution. This defines the kind of families they would like to see move in as 'one man, one woman' with a 'full quiver' of children. Natural Family Values is an intimate portrait of a community at odds with itself, and what happens when democracy and theocracy clash.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/MlXzouft1JuNvxoSGDLygQLCkR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Natural Family Values explores a small Mormon town that passes a resolution defining the proper gender-roles for its citizens and the community backlash that ensued.","title":"Natural Family Values: A Community Divided","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
