Audience members enter and hear the faint voices from the cracks in society. As the tent becomes a convergence of the thoughts of those both on stage and off, we feel the power of resistance that the entire action entails. Functioning both as observer and participant, the director documents the tent's movements around Taiwan in the past decade.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kVoQBNuqUlNszcS3nfTihGFmkvz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2018-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moving Tent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
