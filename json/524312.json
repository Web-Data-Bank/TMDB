When the car accelerates the pig turns at different speeds, while the voice of Residente Calle 13, a young reggaetón singer from Puerto Rico, addresses the viewer in Spanish. He draws on examples of non-human social organizations, such as those among bats, termites, and ants, for possible alternative modes of being-in-common and describes a possible path for contemporary experience. The world he describes is an antagonistic state of order and disorder, civility and barbarity, in an age of armed globalization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweat Glands, Sweat Lands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
