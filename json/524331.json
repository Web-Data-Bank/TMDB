This is a favorite work, where everything is arranged for life. Book racks, a selection of music gourmet discs: Tom Waits, The Rolling Stones, etc. On the walls of the picture are oil paintings with views of the morgue. No cynicism - professionalism, humor and the realized dream of a man who, since childhood, dreams of understanding why a person actually dies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":102208,"logo_path":"/m3NGbr5cr4XIF80L7BZzccEUsVl.png","name":"M.
