It is both her haven and her prison, a whiskey-yellow fantasy where nothing changes and everything is familiar. Her job as a cleaner allows her unlimited assess to the lives of the guests. She steals pieces of the outside world from them, creating a window of escape out of the broken, used and discarded objects that get left behind. A flash of red, a pair of wonderful stilettos, has the power to change everything. Marie has come to the Roadside motel. Dorothy is a story about two women struggling to between different stages of their lives. It is a quiet film, visually sensual, that explores the hard edge of fantasy and womanhood and the inevitability of change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wcoV5sfiop8Lxdbshn0poIFFTLp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nicholas Suter","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorothy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
