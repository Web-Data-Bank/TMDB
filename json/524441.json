His goal is to attend high school in America. Through no fault of his own, after a serious car accident involving his father and the family of his best friend, Miko, Liki finds his life threatened by Miko's evil grandmother, Lijimu, who is a woman known throughout the islands as a horribly diabolical maker of black magic. Lijimu casts a spell on Liki, and this drives the unusually nice, polite and studious boy, insane. Only the noniep can help him, but first the noniep must overcome the enormous power of the evil Lijimu. This enchanting battle is waged before the eyes of the boy's parents, Tomi and Delia, his best friend Miko, and his classmates who are all powerless to help him as he descends into a hellish existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/19CpzbT03QeCLMym5hVESQZ9nkW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Microwave Films","origin_country":"MH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MH","name":"Marshall Islands"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marshall","iso_639_1":"mh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Good and evil battle for the soul of a young Marshallese boy","title":"I am the Good Fairy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
