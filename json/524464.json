Now in her 60s, Txi has been a stage clown for over 30 years, working all over the world with different performance groups. Oddly enough, Txi describes herself as an extremely shy person and explains how performance has helped her battle her introversion.

From Barbara to Txi is an exploration of a woman's perseverance through an unusual sequence of events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qtPhAYynvcm17wuvwUfZzbaosi1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Barbara to Txi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
