As an extension of Moreau’s images of Salome, the project considers gestural control sound design based on “striking” and “bowing” movements, and how these might operate as metaphors by mapping gestures with strong physical associations to sound and rhythm modules specifically designed to represent them. Apparition also investigates music and visuals in the form of a contemporary “composed novel”, exploring the syntax of found footage, pattern, texture, colour, text, gesture and electroacoustic composition.","popularity":0.849,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apparition","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
