Shot almost entirely in and around Estes Park, Colorado, the film follows Alice as she is forced to spend one final week at the family cabin with her hedonistic mother (Elizabeth White) and underachieving brother (Lee Shelton). Plagued with repressed memories, anger and guilt, Alice finds it impossible to connect with those around her, including her boyfriend, Jake (David Zelina) who is looking to start a family of their own. Only after summoning the courage to look within herself, accept her own role in the family dynamic and face the past head on, can Alice hope for a loving and functional future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cold Water","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
