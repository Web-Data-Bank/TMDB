From the 1840s when P.T. Barnum exhibited Tom Thumb to the last remaining shows struggling to survive at New York's Coney Island, we learn the truth behind the sideshow adage that freaks are not born, but rather created, as performers share their memories of the magical midway.","popularity":1.541,"poster_path":"/oq2GCB5xm3FRCUKzEbLVejRBY3l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circus Freaks and Sideshows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
