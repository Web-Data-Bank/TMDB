By afternoon, a little ceremony is held by well-to-do Gandhi-ites, at which a speaker delivers a sermon on \"godly love\"; but when the boy comes too close, he is told to move on by a guard, one of a series of exclusions of this onlooker-outcast.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/oZKOFxIfvmBIYy464ZMZA1kEF4S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2370,"logo_path":null,"name":"Merchant Ivory Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1974-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahatma and the Mad Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
