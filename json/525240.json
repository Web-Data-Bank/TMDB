For 5 minutes of freedom in the main square of the Soviet Union, they paid years of prisons, links and camps. The authors of the film meet three participants of the legendary \"demonstration of seven\" and show young fighters for human rights in modern Russia. Who are they - the dissenters of our time - and what are they willing to sacrifice for the sake of living in a democratic society?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ksH9n1WMOxYNNZ783rILpYiT6Xz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sugardocs","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"5 Minutes of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
