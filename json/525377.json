The continual barrage of repetitive propaganda makes her already banal existence that much worse. Although the film is competent and Eva well-interpreted, the telling of this tale needs a bit more inventiveness to sustain interest in a life that is supposed to be boring.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/9p6NsD8fLp6Yz1mbL5BjwXDIGwN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eva sur paysage ordinaire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
