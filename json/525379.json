His mother disembarks in her traditional attire, a warm-hearted woman who does not have a clue as to how this foreign society functions but also has absolutely no inhibitions about finding out, if the need arises. As the story progresses, the mother catches on to her son's circumstances though the two are still not able to confront the deception and right it. Even with a low budget, this first-time feature-length story by Bahloul Bahloul combines satire, comedy, and pathos to bring home a relationship between mother and son that transcends life's many obstacles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ejJ9PaZwkQMtqza34bv1aDYJvrZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mint Tea","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
