There are situational jokes in the restaurant: the scary food critic who instead gives a good review; Indro and Susan, the cashier, who play around with the security guard’s handcuffs until they have to go around together, which annoys Indro’s girlfriend. There’s also gym humour when Henny, a stewardess friend of Dono, teaches him. And of course, there are jokes among the three friends.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/xiLEzS1TvECh0nyhT4jZwajcFco.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83704,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Parkit Films","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1984-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Itu Bisa Diatur","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
