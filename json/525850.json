The CCC was basically put in place to give young men a job, boost their moral and protect the forests of California. Throughout the short we see the various jobs that were being performed and one really does get a great idea of what this mission was all about and why it was so important to Roosevelt.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jNvma49hTru10nyXuNmgPTX9wwc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Can Take It","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
