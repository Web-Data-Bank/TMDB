One evening, when he returns home from work, he finds a traffic report in the mailbox. But what really gets his attention is the fact that in the photo, in the car, he sees a man sitting next to Ella, his wife. The man puts his hand gently on her neck. Avner cannot see his face. Being the man he is, a man of reason, logic and hard proof, he doesn't talk to her about it, but instead he gets a recorder, and begins to secretly record her telephone conversations, turning into a spy in his own house.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4iipmAbqizJdD7AX2lwkfYZYYLT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
