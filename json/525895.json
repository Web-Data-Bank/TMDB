Unjustly imprisoned in Inverness at the age of 51, she expresses her anger in song, discovering a talent for music; these songs became central to the identity of the region and are still sung today. The achingly beautiful landscape of Skye, and the music it inspired, provide a haunting canvas for this valuable piece of historical research.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freeway Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Gaelic","iso_639_1":"gd","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mairi Mhor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
