Never before screened, they capture Hammer and her former husband interacting together but separately â€“ walking in the woods, riding horses, taking showers. Throughout both of these pieces Hammer uses her own body to manipulate the way in which we see the images, deploying her hands as mattes and creating layers with the shadows of her body.\" - Leslie Lohman Museum","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u1uzcyPd8ROqk7gnLwkcguWvwFU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of a Marriage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
