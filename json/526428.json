She was often called the heroine. She objected: \"I'm not a heroine, I'm just an ordinary person.\" The authors of the film shot Gorbanevskaya for several years, asking questions that worried her as a poet, forced them to go to the square, and how her fate developed after forced emigration from the USSR.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oDzeRHV3BoXpdjF7XjcyQJFuHyq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sugardocs","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natalia Gorbanevskaya: I am not a Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
