On the other side of Jacob’s divine encounter was a new name, a new blessing, a new identity and a new way of walking (literally). Will we be a worshipping people who are not content to sleep through the night (spiritually speaking) and wake in the morning unchanged? Like Jacob, will we enter into the wrestle with God, dare to know Him more intimately and be changed in the process?  This is the premise for Hillsong Worship’s 26th live praise and worship album.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mQRt8Fte9cJvLIqNYSmzm8lqLCK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2018-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hillsong Worship: THERE IS MORE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
