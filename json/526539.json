Forget all the vital intellectual and history garbage and get down to the real simple, good human feeling – and express it in a simple language that reaches people. No bullshit! (Or all bullshit?) Under the sound of the motor, Yanyan’s visual and Dean’s music weaves into each other; and shows the healing power of the trip to both the Chinese and Japanese souls.  Everybody, at a certain point, is a little lost and sometimes we just find a connection to someone that helps to re-inspire or center us. And that experience we'll never forget.  It’s a special relationship in real life - a little bit more than friends but not an actual romance. They get each other and they both know it's not going to go anywhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/78IvgjiIznz0Z1pRJSgZPdN4Khi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 Cartons of Alphabet H","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
