The film shows individual and mass reactions to the proposed national security legislation. It preserves the speeches, songs, chants, posters, and banners, as well as the atmosphere, for those who were there, and introduces them to those who were not. As such, July is a record of events that could not occur anywhere else in China.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2QR6H1DyrR9EA7BGfFFwHYCpXhp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"July","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
