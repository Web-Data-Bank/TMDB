This is a travel journal in the literal sense of the term. The video records my walking through a dozen of major cities around the world, repeating routes and activities, between 1999 and 2005. The mythology of the multiple colors of diverse world cultures shatters. I found myself doing the same things, repeating places I have visited, and inside my mind is often a totally different world irrelevant to the places I visit. Globalization is a popular catch word, the token of economism. Personally speaking, it is a form of irony.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eyAvDPLR7Y45L4RHxiCXibNqBLD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trespassing World Cities","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
