Lots of the footage you've probably seen in the official music videos for the album's four singles (Sadeness, Principles of Lust, Mea Culpa, Rivers of Belief). Some scenes may look a bit cliche nowadays, but putting yourself back in 1990, you can see Michael Cretu's vision. The scenes include landscapes, monks, knights in armor, and trippy illusions.","popularity":0.811,"poster_path":"/cZJPGY5a5pYw8MEA5Yp675T407J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6578,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgin Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enigma: MCMXC a.D.","video":true,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":4}
