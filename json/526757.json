Much was written about this notorious crime but little understood about the hidden, yet legal, tissue transplant industry that spawned it...until now. With exclusive access inside maximum-security prison to the man the NYPD labeled \"Public Enemy No.1\" this film charts how a former surgeon went from saving lives to ripping them apart.","popularity":0.663,"poster_path":"/fI0iKyWHZv5lTVc3EUzLTKYq0HM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bearkatt Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bodysnatchers of New York","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
