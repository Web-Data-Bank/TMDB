Linked in an oblique, dream-like way, these short, sharp stories describe Alice's survival in an everyday world of bizarre logic and strange emotions. A collection of allusive, absurdist, narrative episodes, which often resemble dream fragments; it's a place where miracles unfold in the bathroom and desire appears on a bus, where menacing joggers roam the suburbs and there's something sinister about hats.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maidenhead","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
