His story, which was already the subject of the feature film by Łukasz Palkowski „The Fastest”, acquires the virtue of a personal testimony of a sportsman and former drug addict. In Górski’s turbulent life, combating addiction and the ambition of achieving increasingly better sports results are two sides of the same coin – the ability to overcome your body barriers in order to get to the top.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World Champion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
