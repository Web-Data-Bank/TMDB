But when the costume prompts an allergy attack, Poole begs Pete to take his place at center court; the resulting anonymity frees Pete to discover his inner star. Trouble is, it's Poole who's getting all the attention from fans, who think he's the one behind the mask. Meanwhile, Pete's attempts to get noticed by pretty new girl Angela (Josie Loren) are complicated by the fact that she's also entranced with the mysterious man in the chicken suit. In the end, Pete must decide whether facing the possibility of rejection is worth revealing himself for what -- and who -- he really is.","popularity":8.633,"poster_path":"/wpXmc1PSQ8Ye1XWhiuAEpeHCjMj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47441,"logo_path":"/gkguCwbRf7gmBj4DtAYVWsOA0wH.png","name":"Just Singer Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":42053,"logo_path":"/q7VNAacEiPVzsgCrqtaMooxiPz.png","name":"Salty Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cock-a-doodle-who????","title":"Hatching Pete","video":false,"vote_average":5.599,"vote_count":161}
