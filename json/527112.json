The unceasing transformation of the world is translated into film via the gliding movement of the camera. Bright light and blurring portray the environment of the filmâ€™s elderly subject, my mother, as pure atmosphere. Her few calm gestures in the face of diminishing time and energy convey a personal presence undisturbed by specific goals. She sits and breathes quietly. When walking she travels across space. The turning away of a tree full of apples evokes regret, as does a sharp light that narrows and dissolves. In the final image my mother seems to taste a bitterness that eludes comprehension.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/pZW6w1sO5epaJ3mpCk164e0Obk3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2001-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
