From the musical performances of Arrigo Barnabé to the pioneer comic book Balão (Baloon), the movie approaches the experimentation in the work of a generation of Brazilian artists and the way in which the humor and the horrors of their reality were presented in their compositions. In a quite similar way as the productions themselves, the short movie has an independent and creative approach too, using the own interviewees to narrate and intervene in the film's narrative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fury Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
