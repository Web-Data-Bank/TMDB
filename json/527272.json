The corridors connecting every section are covered with artwork done by inmates with the support from artists.  The latest work is from Earling who will be released soon. His painting is about his travels as a Roma, but his teenage time was deeply influenced by the Nazis.  The most significant work was done by Jan, an inmate in the 1970s. Due to privacy protection, Jan is found nowhere and is known nothing after release, but the paintings recall the memories from two 70 year old veterans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kobbar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
