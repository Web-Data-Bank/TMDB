Three factors make these routines as effective as they are popular. 1. Performed entirely while lying down, this workout allows maximum-intensity concentration (and muscle toning) by focusing on one body part at a time. 2. Continue to grow stronger and shapelier by gradually increasing ankle weights to five pounds. 3. The FIRM's unique (but optional) trick of adding dumbbells (3-12 lbs.) to \"floor\" exercise adds the ultimate level of intensity and results-especially for the buttocks. Master Instructor Tracie Long leads these tested, proven routines compiled from The FIRM's acclaimed Tortoise & Hare Cross-Trainer workouts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qUQYVI3sHiGfjj3Wij4iggu4xP1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Toning floor work for the abdominal muscles, upper and lower body.","title":"The Firm Parts - Sculpted, Buns, Hips & Thighs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
