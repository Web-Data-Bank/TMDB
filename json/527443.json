A story of racial conflict set in the war-torn Burmese forest during 1944 when three soldiers, an African, an Indian and a Briton, end up hiding together. Three disparate bands, Jafa (Tommy Ebow Ansah), Singh (Surinder Singh Ghuman) and Jake (Tony Trent) are embroiled in their own differences of attitude, prejudice, rank and race equality. The film is a fascinating portrayal about the fight for Independence and the Commonwealth nations which helped Britain to win the war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oxWdb0O6qVolyolBucj3EVb5pP5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GH","name":"Ghana"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hausa","iso_639_1":"ha","name":"Hausa"},{"english_name":"Twi","iso_639_1":"tw","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Majesty's Sergeant","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
