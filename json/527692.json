At that time, Laird Hamilton and his gang had just invented tow surfing, using the help of jet skis to catch giant waves on the outer reefs. Laird became a legend and his new sport attracted surfers looking for fame and money. Then, in 2006, dreaming of surfing Jaws in the purest style, the 3 “amigos” began a saga that lasted 5 years. They challenged Jaws year after year, paddling, with no safety, no inflatable vests, nothing.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":"/tHGqUrzodT3JK71eIWndj5fwYil.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Conquest of Jaws","title":"Mad Dogs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
