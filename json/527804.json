She was born into the restaurant business but didnâ€™t follow her calling right away. She moved to San Francisco, came out as a gay woman, and eventually left behind a safe corporate job to pursue her passion of opening a hotel in the sleepy vacation town of Guerneville, two hours north of the city. A restaurant, a market, and a bar soon followed, and the town began its transformation into a thriving destination. Along the way, she weathered a flood that severely damaged her hotel, saw her marriage fall apart, and faced local resistance. A final project pushes her to the brink and changes her perspective on life, love and empire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mK0kypP3Qtjjz84NIG7JK2cD1Li.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empire on Main Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
