Featuring extensive footage and B-roll film from Calgary Pride in the 90â€™s, queer leaders recount a decade of turmoil, loss, and growth of activism and human rights. The film is a first-hand account of the frontlines of LGBTQ2+ activism at a time when the right to be out in Alberta was not legally protected, visible or developed. Spanning stories from 1960-present day, this feature length documentary delves into the moments and victories which brought an entire community from the darkness into the light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vAo7485avf4SOXTqze5v1X0zxRh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outliers: Calgary's Queer History","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
