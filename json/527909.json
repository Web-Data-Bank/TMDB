Tracing the scattered clues of England’s post-industrial northern coastline, with coal mining seams extending deep under the seabed, lead to stories embedded in the surreal landscape and the vivid re-enacting of the death of a young coal miner Billy, by his workmate. The story inspired the New York based percussion group So Percussion, who together with Amber created the film’s cathartic music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song For Billy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
