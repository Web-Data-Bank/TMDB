Each shift begets a kind of origin story: one encounter traces the specific azure of a James Turrell installation to a pet shop jellyfish, in another, a modern-day putto purifies a horrific tale by blowing bubbles in a tub. Sister City, like water, seeks its own level; cresting and displacing continuous bursts of life spiritualized, succulent, and ultimately alone.  -Deirtra Thompson","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jqfyCQTjv7ATWgCXu3K3LEN0UIG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sister City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
