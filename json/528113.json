DELETE the lovemaking. CUT the ‘Open Mouth Kissing’. REMOVE the fondling of the breast sequence. Deemed too ‘inappropriate’ and ‘morally corrupting’ for Australian eyes, these scenes were hacked from feature films and locked away in government archives. When young Sydney Film Festival director David Stratton attempted to program a Swedish film that the censors believed contained ACTUAL sex, a scandal erupted. In a mash-up of never-before-seen banned clippings, SMUT HOUNDS tells the story of how seventy-seven seconds of celluloid scandalised a government and transformed Australian cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yoOSTjNsPdnd6shvM81f4y61Zdc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smut Hounds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
