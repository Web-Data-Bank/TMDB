This historic event was captured on film by Albert C. Phelps, with special photography by J. Allen Hawkins and Jacob DeVries. You'll ride in the cab of the AC-powered 10-car train as it climbs the steep grade. Special scenes include 4274's shake-down run in Roseville as it prepares for its final run, rare pacing shots of the train as it races up the Sierra Nevada foothills, and photo run-bys staged for the passengers at remote locations. This is a rare treat for all steam fans to enjoy!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4HblOKTEm89ID6O0OpxjEC6nJyF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Penetrex","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Run of a Cab Forward Over Donner Pass DVD","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
