This brand-new documentary follows Keenlyside as she travels to Chicago to mount Ferris Bueller's Bedroom as part of celebrations for the 30th anniversary of John Hughes's classic comedy. Get a glimpse of her process as she tracks down replicas of Ferris's prized possessions and works against the clock to get the installation ready in time for the big day. Along the way, she faces unexpected challenges, meets super fans who keep the spirit of Ferris Bueller's Day Off alive, and reveals how art (whether it's a nostalgic installation or a lighthearted film) brings us together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/plmuLGmHvdP7fxK6QjuvoUfs2O0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ferris's Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
