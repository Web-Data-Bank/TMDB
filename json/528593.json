Yet many are not thrilled with the idea of cramming 50,000 fun-seekers into an area 1.5 sq. kilometres in size. Politicians, police, and condo dwellers prepare themselves each weekend for the inevitable onslaught of partiers. Developers have hundreds of millions invested into the area, clubowners millions, and the new residents...their life savings. The city’s old “Garment District” has gone from sweatshops to sweat boxes in a generation and now repeatedly makes the headlines asking the same question: what’s to be done? For the clubbers, their only question is “Where’s the party tonight?” This is Clubland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":105339,"logo_path":null,"name":"MDF Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A look at the nightclub culture in Toronto's Entertainment District.
