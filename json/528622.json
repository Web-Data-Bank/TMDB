It travels underwater and is enveloped by current, cascading toward an 80-foot waterfall. Water pulses over its surface, forming a mass of microscopic lenses that concentrate the world around; an environment fluidly impressing its mark. In between this rush downstream and a final repose, the precipice of Martha Brook Falls is breached.","popularity":1.098,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Martha Brook Falls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
