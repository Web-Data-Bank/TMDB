She is given responsibility to prepare a group of teen drop-outs for confirmation.  Instead, a confrontation over morality presses Mrs. Murphy to articulate convictions she didnâ€™t know she had.  This leads to a crisis of faith, and a shamefully exhilarating private moment.  A playful and distinctive short film that portrays an awkward journey, and raises taboo questions with no thought of delicacy.","popularity":0.809,"poster_path":"/nW6OwbwDzrVGAFWcUrdMgUHc377.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. Murphy's Confession","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
