Over several months, the rig spewed nearly 5 million barrels of oil into the ocean, killing millions of animals and destroying the surrounding environment.  Less than a year later, the Australian Government signed papers allowing BP to come to Australia and drill in deeper and rougher seas.  In 2016 The Great Australian Bight Alliance announced the launch of 'Operation Jeedara' - a campaign that would see the 'Steve Irwin' sail into the heart of the Great Australian Bight to document the beauty of the region in order to showcase what we would all stand to lose if we let BP drill there.  This film is the story of the campaign.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gQn31j0gVfHgomgj4UqPRM94uyd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE FIGHT TO KEEP OIL GIANTS OUT OF THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN BIGHT","title":"Jeedara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
