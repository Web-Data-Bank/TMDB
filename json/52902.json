It is the culture surrounding 'funk carioca', a musical rhythm which mixes the American electronic funk of the 1980s with the most diverse influences of Brazilian music. 'Baile funk' is one of the most interesting musical movements in the world, but it comes from what is at times one of the most violent and poorest places in the world: the slums of Rio de Janeiro (favelas). This music is the personalization of the raw element. Bombastic rhythms coming from the American Miami Bass and samples are fused with powerful rap vocals using Brazilian slang. This documentary tells stories of sex, love, poverty, and pride among Rio's marginalized people. They have their own language, style, and heroes. It's a film that's fast, heavy, and violent like the city itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fafL5SWSr9gHEOJG8sO6giJBM81.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mad Decent","origin_country":""},{"id":2535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bananeira Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":125764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mosquito Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Favela on Blast","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
