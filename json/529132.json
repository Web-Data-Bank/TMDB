Bromberg’s ability to meld ideas and images is perhaps best exemplified in this work, which is truly breathtaking in its conceptual sweep. One line seems to unify the film – a voice repeats on the soundtrack, ‘A girl, blind from birth, saw the flash.’ The flash references an atomic blast, and thus links the film’s beginning section, which is all about origins, and the film’s suggestion of apocalypse, death and the infinite sweep of time.” –Holly Willis, LA WEEKLY","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Aguhz1XQcVN2jD0SUnyrTrVKbSP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divinity Gratis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
