'Big head, short legs' is Eric Bartholomew's first impression of Ernie Wiseman, but their friendship endures and, encouraged by his well-meaning but determined mother Sadie, Eric became the funny man to Ernie's 'feed'. After a successful stint in children's variety, they work their way up the ladder of live performance, but after a disastrous television debut in the series Running Wild, Morecambe and Wise learn to trust their own instincts and just make people laugh.","popularity":2.631,"poster_path":"/7ClpxWx8j0U16wlmhRpjYaSbL9J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/igWZmjr5Zhbnxf7DinSOLoiggLU.png","name":"BBC Wales","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eric & Ernie","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":8}
