In which language shall we write a declaration of love?  Lisbon, Bairro das Col√≥nias, third floor. Conveying and translating an insightful encounter between different worlds, Fatumata and Aissato, mother and daughter, discuss love and the happiness. Their feelings have been determined by narratives and languages acquired at different stages of life and in different places. At 7pm, from the third to the fifth floor, where I live, a regular sound, always the same, like the beating of a heart, reverberates through the building.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u0Fl9Z9uelnMzdef12K13WrgGSR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9047,"logo_path":"/a0oCybecb96ieZY4139hb9uqYs1.png","name":"Terratreme","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2017-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terceiro Andar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
