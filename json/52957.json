Pete tries to trick Bugs and Shorty with an exploding cigar. Doesn't work. The cigar says \"El Explodo\" right on the wrapper. He tries to trick them by disguising himself as Shorty's mother. Doesn't work either. His rabbit ears are leaves that are inelegantly affixed to his hat. How can this poor, pathetic puma win the day? Smarter opponents than he have failed to outwit the wily Bugs Bunny.","popularity":1.214,"poster_path":"/1yoyK87jOS5FuNeS0AV04bwDBRl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8298,"logo_path":"/r6cuEYq7DqrHCNVa7vSanTS0cuw.png","name":"Warner Bros.
