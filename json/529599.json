The Palestinian artist presents a silent slideshow, made up of photographic images, that he made clandestinely at border passages between Egypt and Gaza. The photographs of people waiting are alternated with black screens, metaphors for emptiness and the passing of time, reflecting the difficult and often impossible conditions of mobility for todayâ€™s Palestinians. The video addresses notions of travel and displacement as well as the situation of being between two cultures and identities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ikYbqmp2nlFQUn9GxkDM6Z5QyrN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
