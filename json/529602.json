With this film, Alshaibi questions the confrontation between tradition and modernity by drawing inspiration from geometric motives of Islamic art. The artist offers a re-interpretation of these motifs through computer animation. By turning the shapes in different direction, new images are generated, freeing them from their fixed state. Traditional spiritual values feed the present and open up to a modern perspective.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/28x0KS2DUQMPRrvsMG1ClDJ63Jn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crawl Space Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Allahu Akbar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
