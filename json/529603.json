The artist superimposes images and sounds to highlight the difficulty these women face in proclaiming their identity. The film projects activities of Kabili women which usually include the raising of children, the family, and the household. Erased from the exterior society, their marginalisation is depicted through the fading in and out of images and sounds. However, within their own private spaces, they remain loyal, they sing, dance, and resist a society that does not take into account their full value.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1Wop3WkPYFDGKYishQlpxxdoxXZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K3 (Les femmes)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
