This reference to the clich√© of oriental femininity is tellingly clothed in the colors of the French nation. After a few minutes, just as the body finally begins its rhythmic movements, the Marseillaise blares out demonstratively. The heroic-national aspect of the march music supplants the expected sensuality of the dance.
