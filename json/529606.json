The film also recounts very real stories such as the construction of the audience hall of the Vatican, the preparation of the procession of the 14th of July, the congress of a multinational company in Sardinia, a heart transplant and the training of the young dance pupils of the Opéra de Paris in their school in Nanterre, etc. All of these portrayals of the establishment render the Fashioning of a Western Man possible in fascinating sequences that are sometimes funny, sometimes sad but which remain consistently disquieting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8YVvguAsZvQSd4uLpQWcCpKn75Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Fabrique de l'homme occidental","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
