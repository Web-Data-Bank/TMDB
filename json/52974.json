Got a pencil? \"First,\" says Bugs, \"I was born.\" He quickly learns he is different from the other children: he's a \"rabbit in a human world.\" He grows up to accept repetitive chorus boy jobs in such Broadway revues as \"Girl of the Golden Vest,\" \"Wearing of the Grin\" and \"Rosie's Cheeks.\" His career hits the skids and he's living on a park bench before he's discovered by that great vaudeville star, Elmer Fudd. Their dual comedy act is a hit, which leads to film roles. Will Bugs Bunny ever have to look back?","popularity":2.682,"poster_path":"/eaEWD0hSAhjigeQxqvf14VXqyWQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
