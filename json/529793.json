Set in present day Brunei, Amin (KAI ANWAR) a quirky, London-based ex-pat with a penchant for yellow umbrellas, returns to his childhood home to settle the legal affairs of his recently deceased parents. The momentous homecoming takes a dramatic twist when he encounters his venerable former neighbor Bakar (SHAFIEE MOSTAR) a retired Fire Chief with a chip on his shoulder. Sparks soon fly as these two engage in a battle of one-upmanship of comic proportions. But when unexpected tragedy strikes, the two men join forces, forming an unlikely friendship that proves despite their differences they truly get on like a house on fire. Featuring 100% Bruneian talent, this humorous heart warming tale reaffirms the power of community, difficulties of change and the importance of family,especially during the four Sundays of Puasa.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jYFABqD0FjkH8lCxNX6cB54Sjgb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BN","name":"Brunei Darussalam"}],"release_date":"2018-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fourth Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
