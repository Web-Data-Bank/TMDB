A team of surveyors goes to a small provincial town. Magister ( Jan Nowicki ) and the experts accompanying him plan to build a new road in the vicinity. The geodesists' projects arouse the indignation of one of the local farmers, Biernacki ( Wiesław Gołas ). The envisaged route is to run through the land belonging to it. To save his patrimony, Biernacki is ready to pay a bribe. The dispute between the host and the surveyors is cruelly resolved in front of the party dignitaries participating in the nearby banquet. Jerzy Gruza's painting is a sharp satire of manners, criticizing social relations from the end of the Gierek era.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespol Filmowy \"Perspektywa\"","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1996-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wedding Night During the Daylight","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
