When she pays a home visit to a bubbly gay couple (Ricky and Martin) who are seeking De Facto visa status a hidden agenda becomes apparent, causing Lara to reevaluate her own life and make some big decisions. \"Vis à Vis\" is a bittersweet, topical, offbeat comedy that looks at the choices we make, and the lengths we go to, for the ones we love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/43WclWdRTm8Y0wyYAL3JAzo0tU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150209,"logo_path":null,"name":"Must Dash Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How far would you go?","title":"Vis à Vis","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7}
