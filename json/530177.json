What caused the mass extermination of people on a national basis? Where do origins of interethnic intolerance, anti-Semitism, nationalist propaganda come from? Today these issues are still topical. Nationally motivated conflicts still fare up between people; national hostility is still kindled. There are voices that deny the reality of the Holocaust as a historical fact. We cannot allow a repetition of the monstrous tragedy and should never forget about it!","popularity":1.231,"poster_path":"/6C8naGONu4sfN2IFNWRFdA5yuiR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116315,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ark Pictures","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":74107,"logo_path":"/bzWURboFPnv8EfXIfnxILVOMyGC.png","name":"Russian Film Group","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2018-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Witnesses","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
