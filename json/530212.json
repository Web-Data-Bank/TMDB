It ran for around ten years during the 1970s and 80s before being cancelled. Bitter about their treatment, the pair moved to England, where their chatty, somewhat slapstick and definitely campy presentation style won a second show a cult following.  While it was general knowledge that Hudson and Halls lived together, were unmarried and certainly seemed uninterested in women, they never officially confirmed the nature of their relationship in the New Zealand media while they were TV stars, though they were out in their private lives. This documentary, which includes interviews with the couple's friends and family, explores the men behind the show and their lifelong romance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iIIktk23gB89tQgYJQdmSOnOtlq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hudson and Halls - A Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
