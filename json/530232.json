In drawn out shots, always from fixed camera angles, the aged entertainer is followed from the moment he prepares for a performance in a restaurant. The camera points towards the hallway, where we see ‘Juanca’ leaving the bathroom and carefully getting dressed. During the long drive to the city of his youth, only showing his face and part of the surroundings dashing past, the first words are spoken, after more than nine minutes. ‘You’re shooting a quite silent film, right?’ The old man sings, sometimes outside the fixed frame, his tango songs - shown in their entirety - makes a few sly remarks, and laboriously eats his uncooked ham sandwiches. The audience adores the tawny performer with his unwavering voice. ‘You are eternal, Juanca’, people praise him. Next Tuesday, he will be back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pORgK9jJmR4eMsHGbCVbTDMPGKx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hoy como ayer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
