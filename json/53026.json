Edgar soon recovers from his injuries and begins writing his next novel, seeking inspiration from the local people. His wife, however, has lost her voice and can only communicate through written notes. The islanders grow suspicious of the reclusive couple, their unease soon turning to aggression. Edgar is equally anxious about his neighbors, particularly a solitary widower, Ducasse, who has taken charge of a large consignment of crates. What secret project is Ducasse engaged in – and can it explain the strange behavior of the islanders?","popularity":2.913,"poster_path":"/Au7UmEA1gnUPIljLFPwb180WOkh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandrews","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":14680,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parc Film","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1147,"logo_path":"/tBDaGOA04LmlsbLvMwHjR7WzT9H.png","name":"Madeleine Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1966-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Creatures","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":30}
