The trade continues a centuries-old handicraft tradition rejuvenated by the conditions of global export. This is the hope of a German businessman who has turned a part of the village where cows cross muddy streets into a large manufacture. In a relaxed way, the directors capture the lives of the people in harmony with the serene beauty of the surrounding landscape to depict its change in details of everyday scenes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2007-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Village of Socks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
