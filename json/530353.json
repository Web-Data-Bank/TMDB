Packard evokes a low-budget LEGEND with retro-looking filmmaking techniques and sword-and-sorcery imagery. A twenty-seven minute rough-cut of APPLE exists but the film, made during Packard's time in Hawaii, was never completed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/umUUgfsBT7PZc8uIiI8g9EoeK4o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pookie Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apple","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
