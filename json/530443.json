With a flair for anecdotes and situations, big politics and the small folks along the side of the road, Gerd Kroske has filmed a documentary, which refers back to the educational films of the transit police and footage of surveillance cameras of the state security and shows much more than a piece of “civil engineering” history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z6VlXVaEhov9sDnfluP3RxK0zVO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Highway East","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
