The Aztec Theater of San Antonio hosted the first night of State of the Art. The evening has been described as one of the best broadcasts in Honor Club this year (excluding PPVs) and was attended by international talents such as Atlantis, Lance Archer, Hurricane Helms or Thunder Rosa, among others.  ROH fighters Flip Gordon and Marty Scurll made their return to the company. After a month in Japan fighting in the Best of the Super Juniors tournament, both fighters returned to the United States. The Briscoes, on the other hand, were not present at the show due to a problem with their flights.","popularity":1.019,"poster_path":"/ddYBEe2x4l7A6tNIoIZgcNvm0EW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103501,"logo_path":"/bDAPxOGj1dZWTtv5ubJPh97PiNF.png","name":"Ring of Honor (ROH)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ROH: State of The Art - San Antonio","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
