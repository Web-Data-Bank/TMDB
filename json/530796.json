It was one of three Miranda films directed by Guarini that helped re-establish her in Italian cinema following her return from a largely unsuccessful spell in Hollywood. Many critics were not impressed with the film, feeling that Miranda had not recovered the spontaneity of her pre-Hollywood films. This is considered the first movie in which Federico Fellini has worked as a screenwriter.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/n9eprNw4DCI2N9ET0XntUsCNsPs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39263,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artisti Associati","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1943-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Document  Z-3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
