At the same time, the heroic image of dockworkers is meant to mobilize against American policy, the Marshall Plan, German rearmament and the war in Indochina. Banned by the censors in France, the film won the Grand Prix for Documentary at the 1951 Karlovy Vary Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Live the Dockers","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
