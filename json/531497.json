This script, which preoccupied Guattari’s attention for seven years, represented a blueprint for a subversive popular cinema through an imagined hyper-intelligent infra-cellular life substance—“UIQ” (Universe Infra-quark)—capable of controlling global communications networks and plugging into the “desiring machines” of a community of squatters. After discovering the unpublished script, Paris-based artists and filmmakers Silvia Maglioni and Graeme Thomson initiated a multiform research project that culminates in their film essay In Search of UIQ, which takes on Guattari’s central quandary: how to give shape to a bodiless entity, seemingly without spatial or temporal limits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A1PwwYYq7Esla6GrkF6L6WBJ9kR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of UIQ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
