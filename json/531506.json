Shots are presented in their original order and length. Sound comes from picture locations. This is part of a filmmaking and film curating project to make films of the 50 US states using 16mm. I've invited artists to make other states. The Utah film is a part of this body of work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2eblmhAuzG6SXzwRhOY7JznGfsI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Utah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
