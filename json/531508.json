Filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist Khoa Lê gathered twenty artists around this project. A writer wove a tale inspired by the legends of Vietnam — an actress performs it live — seven artists illustrated it in video segments that follow their own vision and artistic approach — a scenographer adapts their projections and the show’s mechanic to every venue — and seven audio artists take turn creating the soundscape of the piece.By adapting to its venues and the work of its artists and designers, Dans nos villes becomes a festive and eclectic encounter between the artists and the public in a mix of genres, art forms, artistic approaches and cultures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xFcxYn0gOXyMoYfNFASH4vM0GJx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dans nos ville","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
