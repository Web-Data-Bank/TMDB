A movement along things, as if tracing written lines, in order to understand or to grasp, take up, collect them—keeping them around, sustained in memory. There, they continue to rearrange and refocus into sharp or nearly sharp images. These slip and shift, allowing room for a new direction. All the gaze can hold is the single motif from a movement that continues onward. It is my father who stands up. He wants to see. This impulse draws multiple lines—in getting up, in crossing a field of stones, then in the descent of a memory, in slipping and piecing together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6PNd7q8GwcmJAuz4eTchbmFloLh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verso","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
