Known as the grandmother of Indigenous cinema, Merata’s independent political documentaries of the 1970s and 80s highlighted injustices for Māori people and often divided the country. Mita was fearless in her life, her activism and her art. Chronicling the director’s journey to decolonize the film and television screens of New Zealand and the world, the film documents her work, her early struggles with her family and her drive for social justice that often proved personally dangerous.","popularity":1.262,"poster_path":"/lHHmXYjyq6mbRTxIYy52LZTnRLn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":294,"logo_path":"/3XuHM8TXG0gDdPM3xJI14gkZbQy.png","name":"New Zealand Film Commission","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2019-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merata: How Mum Decolonised the Screen","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7}
