The film does not discriminate against anyone and does not glorify natural sport as it also has its disadvantages. It has the participation of people like Jason, Léo Araújo and Rafael Rey and shows the preparation of an athlete until his climb on the stage. As shown in the film I have nothing against anabolic steroids, but I chose to be natural and I want to show that you can have a nice body without using drugs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qvNyZDOEATw6IN6yq5PxaFQZyhf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sem Drogas - A Jornada De Um Fisiculturista Natural","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
