However, it is not the stage but a toilet that binds his destiny. He is bewitched by a daring high school girl, Mi-hyun, who comes into the men's room because the women's room is full. From that day on, Min-hyuk woos her, escorts her home at night, stuffs her locker with roses, and clears passages for her in the morning after a snow fall. For all his efforts, he doesn't get much more than a tender glance from Mi-hyun. When she suddenly vanishes \"sorry\" are the only words she leaves behind.","popularity":0.717,"poster_path":"/3VBK7s2pZXGwcoO4tp0XDBQV8Nu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":868,"logo_path":"/pWznyKg90dGoFpWQ5yAQ0Wdvde8.png","name":"Cinema Service","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":7036,"logo_path":"/javbyY0ZCvlFJtly3tpZqf2NwLX.png","name":"CJ Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2006-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fly High","video":false,"vote_average":5.429,"vote_count":7}
