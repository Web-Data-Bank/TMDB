Oppenheim came to represent the emancipation of German Jews in the nineteenth century, although his work depicting traditional Jewish life has mostly been forgotten.  With an extraordinary collaborative soundtrack fusing electronic music with classical composition performed by the string quartet of the Frankfurt Philharmonic Orchestra, this powerful documentary explores the seminal artist’s traces — and lingering impact — across Germany, France and Israel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sPlbI7fGnPWoQANnqxffJA2T3N9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moritz Daniel Oppenheim","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
