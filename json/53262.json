One day, however, they discover that their treasured Kind Bud is missing. Someone has stolen it and left a clue as to the whereabouts of their stash: a photo of some strangely familiar mountains. Whomever it was, Kyle and Dan vow to find them and make them pay. So they begin a journey filled with assumption, deception and consumption. Locating the missing weed, however, is complicated by the fact that Kyle and Dan have completely burned out their short-term memories. What is said or done right now is of little consequence, because in a few minutes they won't remember a damn thing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some memories are just too hard to remember.","title":"Hempmento","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
