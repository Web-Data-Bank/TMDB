We see them in pee-wee Silver Glove matches with dad constantly pushing them. Ten years later, they're young men, with dad as both father and manager. A professional promoter, Nick Everson, wants to sign the boys, but dad rejects those offers. Then, in expressions of their varied relationships with their father, each son makes his own decisions. Can dad ever step aside, and can the family hold together?","popularity":2.506,"poster_path":"/yRFEv3c5uEVywcREzEL4FiwhX1p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12,"logo_path":"/5ThIuO93vsk47oexKTSdfKEr7EC.png","name":"New Line Cinema","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes the toughest battles are fought in your own family.","title":"Price of Glory","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":7}
