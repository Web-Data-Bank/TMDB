Each new section presents a variation on the same sleek, kinetic minimalism. As each section progresses, the razor-sharp line between a host of binary oppositions—black/white, figure/ground, silence/sound, here/there, on/off — dissolves through sheer velocity. The rapid-fire alternation between these binary oppositions acts like the flicker of film frames, accelerating until sound and sight are wed into a synchronous whole in which neither the visual nor the sonic takes primacy. Instead, each acts as mutually constitutive literalisation of the other.  — Joseph Clayton Mills","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iStOVZtRYRR1Bwo5oUBaRyDLTwY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entr’acte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8 switches (Part 6)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
