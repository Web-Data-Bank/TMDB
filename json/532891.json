Longing for a sense of belonging with grandiose dreams of becoming a wrestling superstar, Randy is only met with abject humiliation and alienation. A brutal shaming at a local wrestling school pushes Randy over the edge and lights the spark for his blood lust. Donned in wrestling gear and armed with homicidal rage, Randy sets out on a blood soaked rampage to punish those who wronged him. With each ghastly kill, Randy takes a trophy from his tormentors to add to a wrestling title belt crafted from human flesh. The only hope of putting an end to his reign of carnage lies with Becky, an understanding client who is one of the only few to ever show him kindness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p3Nd85QEhaXgCVk3WVfjmPzbkG0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81907,"logo_path":"/aCPBKejB9rYlfvvh1iM6vQXaRYi.png","name":"Fuzzy Monkey Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You can’t tap out when you’re dead!","title":"WrestleMassacre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
