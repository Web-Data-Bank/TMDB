While Nellis parents have the perfect career and man planned, she dreams of becoming a singer. Through a chance meeting at the studio, she meets the young and grungy Hip Hop music artist Sunen and asks him to help her make a demo tape.  Not only is the ensuing story about differences growing closer and the difficulties that have to be overcome, well told. Also the music is exceptionally well made. It is quite unbelievable that this is the first feature of the director.","popularity":1.884,"poster_path":"/mFI69H3mY45zjMO1isfy3qGtOAM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6159,"logo_path":"/pbWyMDcAM6s228tiUxjl3v1OAxr.png","name":"Helsinki Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2005-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beauty and the Bastard","video":false,"vote_average":6.452,"vote_count":31}
