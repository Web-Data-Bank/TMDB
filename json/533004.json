Coworkers Gwen and Marc realize that their colleague has been placed under a peculiar curse and begin working together together to break this most unusual spell. Together, the trio hysterically wrestle with what appears to be a demonic force inside of Roger, and comically keep it under wraps from their agitated boss. Our riddle is solved in a transforming way as Roger escapes near death, developing a new respect and appreciation for women. The Creeper's Curse puts a comedic and fantastical twist on what could happen to a sleazy and ignorant male.","popularity":1.358,"poster_path":"/aoFXUHG5vHVcbcsjAZTxUgYkOB0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Creeper's Curse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
