This meditative documentary essay – from a Latvian writer and Lithuanian director whose composed touch has long dovetailed with the stylistically diverse works of the Baltic New Wave – pushes adroitly past the limits of the common his-toriographic investigation to create a portrait of less-clearly remembered filmmakers. The result is a consummate poetic treatment of the ontology of documentary creation. Also a cinematic poem about cinema poets.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tnB6H4uj0uAIcsryRR9e95fgOKM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Nominum","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":103826,"logo_path":null,"name":"OÜ Vesilind","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2018-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bridges of Time","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
