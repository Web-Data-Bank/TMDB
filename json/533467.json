Deciding to renounce women altogether, he finds a house in his old neighbourhood and persuades his elderly crotchety father Harvey to move in with him. Harvey is something of a comic and, as Mel rediscovers, none too easy to live with. To add to the friction, there's the landlady, Jackie. From Mel's point of view as an aspiring celibate, she's all wrong: far too intelligent, attractive and unconventional. But, strangely enough, Jackie becomes the focus of the Rosenblooms' refashioned lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w3PVcYU9bdRKhL3PSOUxyQGJvXG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4042,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astral Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1990-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falling Over Backwards","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
