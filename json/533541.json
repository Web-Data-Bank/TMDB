Every day as of January 1st, 2007 and for an entire year, as indicated in the title, a large public (the artist's friends, as well as unknowns) were invited to view a diary of short films of various lengths (from one to twenty minutes) on the Internet. A movie was posted each day, adding to the previously posted pieces, resulting altogether in nearly thirty-eight hours of moving images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A6zlbQdL5bNVRx13wRJrpmCNbRI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":999,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"38 hours of moving images","title":"365 Day Project","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
