Katrin is attractive, just as successful and an incorrigible romantic. Chance makes the two the ideal couple. At least almost.

And so Jan sinks a little too deep in the cleavage of his secretary Melanie, and Katrin can not resist the adventurer Jonathan's lead role.","popularity":2.239,"poster_path":"/lRsSvgnmKatNQm52WMzGfstNGiN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47,"logo_path":"/i7Z9ot2o3N5Sa3HrF09kniFs2y8.png","name":"Constantin Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":24}
