The crew revisits the classic Utah gaps that Ostness/Wind-Up Films pioneered years ago and discovers a few new ones on the way. Upper/Lower Flagstaff and Pyramid, all mandatory 90 foot spans, pale to Tanner Hall hitting 120 foot Chad'd5s Gap skiing backwards at 53mph and stomping a switch 900. The crew travels from unique backcountry features, super-sized park, kickers over half pipes, freeskiing in the Alps, Alaska and face shots in Utah. The intro was shot on 35mm film with a full rock video production crew in Oslo Norway, a just start for a ski film that is crawling out of the box with a new style and a fresh look at insane action. Filmed in Europe, Scandinavia, Utah, California, Alaska on 16mm and 35mm film. Eclectic soundtrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gnhTJuK8S9YTHa2ZZUxcHJK61Tt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teddybear Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
