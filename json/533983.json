He is an alcoholic, unemployed and terribly depressed, largely because of the death of his wife. However, Victor is still the best in one thing: telling fantastic stories to his nine-year-old son, Ingmar. These stories are each of the scripts he dreams of directing in the future, when he gathers all the necessary resources. Victor and Ingmar share a present full of sadness and precariousness, but also full of robots and locations of films they have seen together. Despite forming a great team, their problems will multiply when others begin to question their role as a father.","popularity":2.642,"poster_path":"/xvdnPjkvOftz6drRiEeAK393hxL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88799,"logo_path":null,"name":"la bestia produce","origin_country":""},{"id":10012,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nadie es Perfecto","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":32485,"logo_path":"/fVXreZkiJTOq1cCi6htSQlPSy7R.png","name":"Pokeepsie Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up Among the Stars","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":28}
