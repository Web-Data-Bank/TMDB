A sequence of vignettes that could loosely be described as sketches, most featuring large, naked women in a variety of \"hilarious\" situations, linked by a combed-over MC who laughs at his own jokes. Lots of prefab video effects, lots of disco music, lots of shot-on-video stupidity. Guaranteed to make your brain dribble out your nostrils.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mEOuqO2I2xBmEBSdR1w7docX946.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Taste Movie No. 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
