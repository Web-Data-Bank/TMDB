Liza Minnelli's unforgettable portrayal of singer Sally Bowles and the film's stylish recreation of the era have become defining images of Weimar Berlin.  In this documentary, actor Alan Cumming explores the truths behind the fiction. He meets many of those closely involved with the original film, including Liza Minnelli, and talks to cabaret artists, among them acclaimed performer Ute Lemper.  Alan explores the origins of the Cabaret story in the writings of Christopher Isherwood and uncovers the story of the real life Sally Bowles, a woman very different from her fictional counterpart.  He talks to the composer of Cabaret about the inspiration for the film's most famous songs and discovers the stories of the original composers and performers, among them Marlene Dietrich. Finally, Alan reveals the tragic fate of many of the cabaret artists at the hands of the Nazis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1YOWDGqDrUMoDTa2dv2C0AUDUD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12935,"logo_path":"/rml1bBbFJ33HE0rTrkNpuFVfpAQ.png","name":"BBC Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Alan Cumming explores the true stories on which the Cabaret musical was based.","title":"The Real Cabaret","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
