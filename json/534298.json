The title refers to an unnamed country where lovers use silence to express their love for each other. Slightly unstable office worker Rak (Francois Cluzet) is not silent but rambles in monologues, describing himself in the third person. Fired from his job, he goes into \"business\" for himself -- sitting in a cafe and interviewing salesmen for a position selling a non-existent encyclopedia. When he sees a real estate agent evict young musician Lucie (Elina Lowensohn), he uses a toy gun to rob the agent (who dies of fright) and then offers Lucie space in his spacious but seedy apartment, where the two find love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wEe9uQm8idpcNgWH1MCN8FdfTJJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silence of Rak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
