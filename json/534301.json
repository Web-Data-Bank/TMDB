She is alone, single, has left the family and her great love back home, with the promise of returning in one year. Unable to return, she settles down and has a new family and a new life in Brazil. Vida, which means 'life', is her name and she is the director's grandmother who returns to Slovenia with her granddaughter 73 years after her arrival in Brazil. Their journey, the family journey, has a different nature: subjective, poetic and emotional. A journey that struggles to retain unstable memories, relieving feelings and discovering what is hidden in our souls.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cZuJrFs7LYrNIuo7y5FRHWpIxWx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vida","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
