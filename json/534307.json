This is something we cannot see. Not really. But somehow, we can, because we are being shown the interior and the roof of an empty-looking building: dark stairways, rooms, corridors and halls, along with glimpses of a metropolis at night in the background. Most of all, however, this film shows vibration: it is vibration. A phantom-like figure (in the end there will be two) moves through these spaces ditheringly, attached to bright filaments reminiscent of a gigantic web. Vibration pervades everything we are being shown here – all of the house and all of the image. It all jerks in a stop-motion-like non-movement caused by changes in the lighting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Government House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
