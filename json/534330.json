Told with the kind of warmth, humor and perspective that only an established relationship brings, Brett and Melanie share their experiences of recognizing and embracing their sexual selves, and the story of how they met and fell in love.  Throughout the interview, there is a constant dance of who is strong for whom, of who is vulnerable and who nurtures; and this dance continues when Brett and Melanie make love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uNIu5MXDXWbePMWJhjdKXtGnyz1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comstock Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brett and Melanie: Boi Meets Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
