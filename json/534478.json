A journey through and into Self, the constructed labyrinths of Ego, and the creative transcendence of the mind's physical limitations. Birth of BrainFly charts a surreal course of a psyche's evolution within the invisible landscape of the mind. The visual landscape is made up of a mélange of experiments in collage, live action, hand drawn, paint on film and multi plane.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k4YS4cSOSFHGHxhGUQ1d42hFY3X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38413,"logo_path":"/qW9eadVJfNRx9jdZkuDxWR25RW6.png","name":"CalArts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Birth of BrainFly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
