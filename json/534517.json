Few sailing vessels are surrounded by more myth and legend than the yacht Zaca. Launched on the eve of the great depression, the 118' gaff-rigged topsail schooner has sailed through 75 years of history from one remarkable adventure to the next. Zaca has served as a luxuary yacht, scientific research vessel, navy patrol boat and party boat for Hollywood swashbuckler Errol Flynn. This documentary offers a riveting window into the past as seen through the eyes of this historic ship and the survivors of those who sailed her. Produced and directed by Luther Greene.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zW1HSNAEv8kpp0pmOcmLeFkERJ5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Remarkable Adventures of a California Schooner","title":"In the Wake of Zaca","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
