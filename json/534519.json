These films are designed in such a way that the camera films a frontal view of the apparently motionless face, and a touch-a caress of the hair, a kiss, a hug-demonstrates the artistÂ´s relationship with the subject being portrayed, who react in various ways, whether through a lightening of facial expression, a smile or intensified squinting. This matter of involvement represents the specific nature of this series of portrait films, ensuring Kubelka an outstanding position in the field of avant-garde film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rKCq9C60GPmq468L6Sk3O8gAUNt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Kubelka und Jonas Mekas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
