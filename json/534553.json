Zischler, who also wrote a book of the same title, spent the next twenty-five years combing through archives and libraries to locate many of the now-extinct films cited by Kafka in his journals. The result is a witty conjecture on the Czech writer's fascination with film and Zischler's fascination with Kafka.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/vKHrtbU77a5WdUbpjVGe4SyBBEL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kafka Goes to the Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
