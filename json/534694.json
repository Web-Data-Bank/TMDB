The film centers around Ching Kit, a mob boss who instead of using typical tools of underworld shakedowns -- mob hits, blackmail, and the like -- employs the dinner party to negotiate deals, to forge partnerships, and craft revenge. When Ching works out a deal with the Portuguese mob that would give him partial control of Macau's casinos, he quickly learns that treachery lurks around every corner. Veronica Yip Yuk-hing, Cecila Yip Tung, and Pauline Wong Siu-fung also appear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dimiLA1HNJWJvBSF76mlddV8Vko.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69658,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lui Ming (International) Film Enterprises","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":40501,"logo_path":null,"name":"Long Shong Pictures (H.K.)
