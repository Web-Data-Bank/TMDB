Good. Because it’s time to hit the road with the most infamous band of pro wrestling heels ever. J.J. Dillon will be our guide back to 1987 for seven days, and we’ll live the life with him as we check into the hotels, grab the rental cars, make the planes, reach the venues, hit the bars, meet the ladies, buy the cocktails, and everything else you can imagine! Oh yeah, we wrestle too.  J.J. and Kayfabe Commentaries have gone to great lengths to recreate this week in painstaking detail. You’ll do the road, the house shows, the studio TV and the syndicated TV.  Was it work? Play? Or something in between?
