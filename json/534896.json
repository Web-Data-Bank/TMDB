This special aired on ABC-TV on December 14, 1973 and featured special guests Peter Ustinov and Peggy Lee.  Most memorably, Andrews and Lee duet on a trippy, campy medley that delightfully careens from hit to hit over the most fun 8 and a half minutes you'll ever have with your pants on. Andrews plays a TV Hostess whose wandered into a cardboard forest and stumbles across Lee as the Sugar Plum Fairy lazing on a divan and ready for some fun - complete with ultra soft-focus and a bedazzled microphone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mHYP9eusfxoBWxTvHXHVvG3kgg6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34703,"logo_path":"/pZ4IVMy5M2742GwXqBIE8EkQiOA.png","name":"Associated Television (ATV)","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Julie tries her hand at a Christmas Special.","title":"Julie's Christmas Special","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
