Beginning with the star’s face projected on a large screen, mouthing the words to her #1 hit “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” the scene cuts to Miss Ross (draped in furs and jewels, of course) sauntering down a white, almost surreal staircase.  At the bottom of the stairs – during the joyous, climactic crescendo of the song  – she suddenly bursts from the screen and onto the stage, greeted by the screams and cheers of an overwhelmed audience.  Those lucky enough to be at these shows literally watched a superstar come to life before their eyes; incredibly, the impact is equally great when watched on a television screen decades later.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bZePZPsreHlaVJTSoFSEqaKfOyK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Diana Ross concert at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas in 1979 is one of those legendary live shows.","title":"Standing Room Only: Diana Ross","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
