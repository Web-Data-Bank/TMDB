He built a small cottage from driftwood and salvaged items and through his ingenuity and skill created an alternative lifestyle free from the burden and control of the utility companies and authorities. But this is so much more than a story of someone living an alternative lifestyle; it's a story of family, friendship, love, compassion and struggle. Mungo became a 'Local Hero', an advisor, he brought people together from all walks of life, he became a destination. The authorities didn't have the same view however, and Network Rail started legal proceedings to have him removed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fajpmrk1tWlu4g801Wk4PcZwEiR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life's a Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
