Miley Stewart (aka Hannah Montana) has had enough of the double life. Being a superstar pop princess all day, every day, would be totally awesome, right? Cory sees moneymaking opportunities in every corner of the White House when he becomes Mr. President. But while he's busy wheeling and dealing, oh, yeah, there's also that little business about running the country. And for regular guys Zack and Cody, living the swanky and \"suite life\" isn't enough â€” they want to be superheroes! As Miley would say, \"Sweet nibblets!\"","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/rYCF6NY5cv9LZ70t5tInbmCeLUn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Shooting Star, Three Wishes","title":"Wish Gone Amiss","video":false,"vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":11}
