Is it just the interaction of time, space, particles and forces? A hallucination created by billions of neurons in our body? A mathematical machine?  Are there other realities, universes or dimensions?  Dimensions is entertainment made and inspired by science and discovery. A rollercoaster ride of visuals and music that takes audiences on a fascinating journey. The show transports audiences to awe-inspiring worlds where they find the time and space to think and feel about the big questions of our time.  What sticks is a strong feeling that there may be unexplored realms and worlds in us, and around us, which influence us even more strongly than what we already know and understand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dimensions - Once Upon Our Reality","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
