PHA sequencing also strengthens the heart by repeatedly making it pump blood back and forth between distant muscle groups. When used on alternate days they sculpt your body by preventing muscles from adapting to predictable exercise sequences, and maximize aerobic endurance and fat burning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yh6aAWLs3t7ILxUrXuk79HAnUGW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Total body workout that alternates effective upper and lower body weight training exercises.","title":"The Firm Cross Trainers - Firm Strength","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
