Largely consisting of juxtaposed daguerreotypes from the period and newspaper printings, LA PAMPA GRINGA exhibits Birri’s ability to weave narratives out of historical documentation in deft, admirable form.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lo1ILNmGVBtiV3SdMEzLVEUqvNo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instituto de Cinematografía de la Universidad Nacional del Litoral","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Pampa Gringa","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
