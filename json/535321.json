M. Barrie's Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, produced for television as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame, starring Mia Farrow as Peter Pan and Danny Kaye as Captain Hook, and with Sir John Gielgud narrating. Julie Andrews sang one of the songs, \"Once Upon a Bedtime\", off-camera over the opening credits. It aired on NBC at 7:30pm on Sunday, December 12, 1976, capping off the program's 25th year on the air. The program did not use the score written for the highly successful Mary Martin version which had previously been televised many times on NBC. Instead, it featured 14 new and now forgotten songs, written for the production by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse.","popularity":6.085,"poster_path":"/2dioGZswbH2NW8TN7qtRutLMTDe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34703,"logo_path":"/pZ4IVMy5M2742GwXqBIE8EkQiOA.png","name":"Associated Television (ATV)","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":9027,"logo_path":"/eGT7RxXHIyhByHpZmv4WxBwoWAl.png","name":"Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1502,"logo_path":"/ywjcvHUiKxv7cYsestkONF8LieH.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A new television version of the children's classic - notable for it's stars and the brand new Newley-Bricusse score.","title":"Peter Pan","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
