It is put together in such a way as to provide miniature, almost instantaneous fictions, confined and numerous, where meaning can occur between the frames as much as it might in the frame. Overall, the film could be described as a visual assault as well as a reference to the invasive nature of the act of taking photographs and more abstractedly with the problem of image or picture functioning as representation of some or all aspects of an object or thing.  While the movements and the pace of the film are structured as to suggest relentlessness and insistence of control, the assembly of images therein serve to illustrate the nervous breakdown of the characters represented as their actions, forced into exact repetitions, lose their original expression and take on a new, more ominous existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ugBuZX4eJ8gBYXgsfGgGXJedsUO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FF (aka Fuck Face)","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":5}
