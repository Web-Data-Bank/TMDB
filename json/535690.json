Adapted from the play La Tosca by French playwright Victorien Sardou, opera star Xiao Xiangshui (Bai Guang) helps her lover, a revolutionary, to escape from warlords. She finesses with both the head of the secret service (Yan Jun) and her lover's wife, but things do not turn out as planned. Li changed his usual pace to encompass a more conventional and dramatic film plot. Bold and flirtatious in her role, Bai Guang is equally over the top in appearance as Yan Jun. The tension in winning the heroine over drives the plot more than the themes of patriotism and loyalty in love.","popularity":1.372,"poster_path":"/xNwlK3oT5FS9Lz1hC28b0AJMvQG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Great Wall Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1950-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Strange Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
