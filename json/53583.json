When they hear on the radio that the police are looking for them, they dump the car and hide out near a farmhouse. But the farmer's radio also broadcasts the couple's description, so they run away and start hitchhiking, only to be picked up by two policemen. They manage to flee into a railroad yard and hop a train that turns out to be refrigerated. Finally they decide to turn themselves in -- just as they learn that the real crooks have been apprehended.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4htDH3vfWRRnZXGaZDAMqzz6qFz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The E-Flat Man","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5}
