The Israeli settlers are waging a daily war on the Palestinians who remain; they harass their neighbours, attack their houses, move their livestock and generally make life unbearable for them. And after years of violent resistance a new generation of Palestinians have undertaken a new strategy and are fighting back with video cameras rather than guns. They post their videos online to show the world what is happening but what does all this mean for the possibility of peace? An in-depth and eye-opening investigation into life in the West Bank.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/icPa571yqhIt0H47Q0CAXQ2j60V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Stop: Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
