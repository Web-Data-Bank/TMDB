He hires ace detective David Cassidy to track down and get Buck, dead or alive. However, when Buck goes to see his dying mother she makes him promise to reform, and he does. Cassidy, though, doesn't care about that and tries to arrest him. Buck decides to do something that will once and for all show everyone that he has indeed reformed--especially Faith Lawson, a pretty station agent he's in love with.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5XkSYWxS7HIHl3YXG2A5M0H1UEM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32484,"logo_path":null,"name":"William S.
