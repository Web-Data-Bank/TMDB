Despite his knowledge, once he's there, MacWhite sees only a dichotomy between the U.S. and Communism. He can't accept that anti-American sentiment might be a longing for self-determination and nationalism. So, he breaks from his friend Deong, a local opposition leader, ignores a foreman's advice about slowing the building of a road, and tries to muscle ahead. What price must the country and his friends pay for him to get some sense?","popularity":2.724,"poster_path":"/f7LkAqiqfdFE4oYEM8wQuGDBu2W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10330,"logo_path":"/nY62adzeba5GVK8LJYD6yd9R8H4.png","name":"Universal International Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The most explosive adventure of our time!","title":"The Ugly American","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":26}
