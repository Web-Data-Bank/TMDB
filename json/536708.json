In the midst of her meagre existence she suddenly receives the news that she has been chosen to be Queen of the Spring. She is going to wear a magnificent white dress and her hair gets decorated. A flurry of excitement accompanies the outlandish coronation ceremony. Dayana is enthroned on a stage, surrounded by a bevy of similarly clad princesses of the same age. Afterwards, she dances with Walter, her Spring Groom in a suit and tie. The couple do not look particularly happy. Told in a series of long takes, the film provides a close and intense glimpse of another world far away. No explanation is provided and so the proceedings remain a mystery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wTitqZM4UTEwZnZhhn87laIAUr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"2014-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
