He was one of the greatest, most original talents of this time and has been judged a precursor of firstly the modernist style and subsequently of the Art Deco movement. His legacy lives on all around us in his instantly recognisable style.  A MODERN MAN takes a critical look at Mackintoshâ€™s life and artistic career and the importance of the friends and patrons who provided him with regular work when it mattered most.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/52LRM7kpY5xW5k7VF8I15uLvzAe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charles Rennie Mackintosh: A Modern Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
