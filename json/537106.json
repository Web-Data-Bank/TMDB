What starts off as curiosity soon has her spiraling out of control as she realizes that what she wants out of life is to be an exhibitionist. It is a lifestyle choice that goes against everything that is expected of her by society, and she struggles with a desperate need to reconcile the role she plays in life, that of a wife and mother, with her hidden identity. Out of desperation to feel fulfilled, she turns to the internet and finds that not only are there others out there like her, but there are those who are willing to meet with her to mutually enact their hidden fantasies. Christy is sucked into the seedy and sometimes dangerous world of meeting up with strangers to take sexual risks in public. And although she is finally living the life she believes should be hers, she is wracked with guilt for her lies and for the double life she has created apart from her family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cZD3ZaG3ChRh1MYIBWHEArsZiDq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turn Around","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
