Harry Voss, 12, is young and naive. Love, for him, is romantic love between princes and princesses demurely kissing each other on the mouth. His father is a hero who kidnapped his mother and married her on a lonely mountain peak... Later on, he'll do the same. But Harry has a lot to learn. He learns about 'being hot' and 'fucking' and about what you have to do when you're alone and 'feel the itch'. He also learns that there are handsome men and ugly ones, that love can be unfair. That one can find comfort in drinking... but above all he learns that man is capable of anything - absolutely anything! - to get his fair share of love.","popularity":2.579,"poster_path":"/3FgGPdw1TGvoCv372DClw3FesFL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11796,"logo_path":"/tx6LOQcTSqgW8ffKxovuJHjlYVw.png","name":"Centre du Cin√©ma et de l'Audiovisuel de la FWB","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":110350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kabinet van de Gemeenschapsminister van Cultuur","origin_country":""},{"id":110351,"logo_path":null,"name":"Multimedia (BE)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1987-10-01","revenue":119919,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crazy Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":18}
