For one New York firefighter, Don Eichin, water has not only acted as his weapon of safety, but also a source of recreation. In New York, a strong community of surfers dwell underneath the ashes and uniforms. These warriors have risen about sea-level to conquer fire, as well as submerge themselves to dominate water. The only element stronger than their honor and skill is the bond of their brotherhood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5jG1gJeHjilcfYJAjJetJ4zEqJQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fire and Water","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
