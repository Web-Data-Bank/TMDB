One of them is taking a genial young man to his unforeseen future; he would marry his beloved; have a son; become a brilliant doctor; do his duty and save the live of enemies of the communist regime; get a 20-years sentence for that. Prison would turn out to be an unbearable nightmare; his wife would eventually give in to the tortures of the authorities and seek divorce; this would mean no one to visit him in prison. 15 years without any news about his child, only a snapshot of his family on which the tree of them are smiling and happy.","popularity":0.955,"poster_path":"/mV4H3mmKGb1eB6wqT7NxIthIlp9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74701,"logo_path":"/tXlAkHJqG0Vf8fPnRPKwskEJlDK.png","name":"BNT","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":74827,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doli Media Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":106973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kamera","origin_country":""},{"id":106974,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Film Centre","origin_country":""},{"id":106975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paralax","origin_country":""},{"id":106976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vreme Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2005-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Izpepelyavane","title":"Parched","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
