Settling into this interstitial expanse of Shirin Neshat’s Soliloquy (1999), viewers become mediators, with the series of scenes on each screen flowing not past, but through this audience – asking them, perhaps, to act as witnesses to the ensuing visual dialogue. The titles begin, in English and Persian; then, the sole character appears, clad in black robes and played by Neshat herself. She is looking out of two different windows: one in Albany, New York; the other in Mardin, Turkey, not far from the artist’s native Iran.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7sr1LiZPKy83uLq5rkZnlJ6Ym7S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soliloquy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
