The film construction, created at the optical printer, is of course also a counter concept to the more narrative models: the marks of war are not primarily made visible on the representational level, but more through the damage done to the film material itself from rubble and dampness, but also through the filmÂ´s editing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tHMx9BmjQUpCP50KMMDW222Iyv9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tito-Material","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
