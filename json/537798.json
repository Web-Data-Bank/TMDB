Presented as an episode of an educational series about tripping, this short film by Brazilian director, Clemente, is a visual feast of production design, costuming, and composition. A narrator walks us through as a test subject — a young woman named Nancy Clark (played by Karen Tribess) — prepares herself for the mind-altering experiment to “transcend the edges of the known world” with strict monitoring of diet and exercise. Once injected with the cosmic dope, the effects kick in — she floats through the sky and bikes on clouds. But back at the lab, something appears haywire. Oops! “The Cosmic Dope” is a stylish send-up / delightful re-imagination of TV productions of the 1960's.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oxqRnTDAyz3uL5vjiSSvtTA7PbY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cosmic Dope - A Plant Experience","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
