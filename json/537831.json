This was a fairly disgusting space with dirt floors and four-foot ceilings from which the leaking guts of the operation above hung down, but it was open, and I could stretch out full 100' foot rolls of film from end to end on the floor. From there, I could freely apply developers, bleaches and fixers in whatever ways I could think of, usually mashing in the dust, leaves, and garbage that was kicked up in the process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iktCu2SbUdugdmfz92w0b6eCClf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pillager","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
