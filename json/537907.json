But not only. He is an inspiring person; one of those who leave a mark on you when you meet him. He is persevering, he is positive, he boosts your strength, he encourages you to stand up. He is, in summary, a motivational person. Maybe, part of this strength comes from his own struggles, from his own experience, from the fact that he is one of the few carpenters in the world who does not use his hands, but his feet, due to an undiagnosed disability. This is the story of Sintayehu, the story of his life.","popularity":0.809,"poster_path":"/o9Fr1mOzpwlS9B81ZnzXWAg8A0u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I've Seen So Much","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
