These paths would improve connectivity for commuters, tempt tourists to visit the many attractions within easy reach and, critically, deliver a social and economic uplift to the area.

We have to save this remarkable and historic structure before concrete suffocates it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nApAoOQ3TCOoXxiCmhuA992CTuV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our 2020s Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
