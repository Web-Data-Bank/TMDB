Mabley appeared in the film, along with veteran actors Butterfly McQueen and Stepin Fetchit, only a year before her death at the age of 81. The film does not deal with the popular Christian hymn (with words by John Newton) but is a play on Mabley's character, who happens to be named Grace. It has been released on home video.","popularity":1.265,"poster_path":"/mf0seiucsFVfiXCVqgATvm2l635.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who's Comin' to Put an End to Dirty Tricks, Crooked Politicians and Lyin' Mayors!
