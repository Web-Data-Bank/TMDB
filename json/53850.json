Both these and several victims are dug up by modern archaeologist Harrison 'Harry' McColl's expedition. Despite a cryptic warning from tribal locals, everything goes to his Colorado university's museum. It's all exhibited during another eclipse, which leads to the monster reviving. Harry and some of his friends must try to petrify the monster again.","popularity":4.578,"poster_path":"/i5WRZ8HPDwRvvJySTbd6OoqEJri.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sci Fi Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":29185,"logo_path":null,"name":"BUFO","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":12029,"logo_path":"/8PAf5K4VVI6xO9SjB7bxLtpi4xH.png","name":"Curmudgeon Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An eclipse awakens an ancient monster whose gaze turns flesh into stone.","title":"Basilisk: The Serpent King","video":false,"vote_average":6.556,"vote_count":46}
