On examining the handkerchief, the beauty returns it, telling George that it does not belong to her. He then confesses that he knows very well that it is not her property, as it happens to be his own, and his offering it to her was only an excuse to make her acquaintance, so struck was he by her beauty. Upon this frank declaration the young woman draws herself up haughtily, but George is not to be discouraged, but follows closely behind her, ready to be of any assistance on the slightest pretext. We therefore see him arriving at the lady's house laden down with such articles as a lampshade, a statuette, a bunch of roses, a bundle of dress goods, and, in addition, leading an enormous dog on a leash, against whose attacks he is endeavoring to protect himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kwAPsIwx7iyva6TvyWA2Jfwg5Qv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1909-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Conquest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
