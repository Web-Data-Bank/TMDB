Lost and forgotten for over 2,200 years, this clay army, 8,000-strong, stands poised to help the First Emperor rule again beyond the grave.  NOVA tests the power of these weapons with high-action experiments and reports on revolutionary 3D computer modeling techniques that are revealing new insights into how the clay figures were made. The program reveals the secrets of one of archaeology's greatest discoveries and brings to life the startlingly sophisticated world of Qin's legendary empire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yriyNQ4rKVCwPuJpHBzMD5P3rFt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"},{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6773,"logo_path":"/thh8BxybjvOoI618djeXzwhGfh4.png","name":"NOVA","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emperor's Ghost Army","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
