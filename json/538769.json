The \"premise\" is that a young boy is watching the show on a strange CD that his mom bought. Sketches include \"Glass Booth Guy\" in which a gas station clerk mocks people from his bullet-proof glass box and a sketch in which a woman is trying to break up with her weird boyfriend (he's a skeleton). The undisputed highlight is \"OEDEBATTLE\", a parody of Mortal Kombat-style games. In it, the young boy tries to defeat Steve's muscle-bound character; unfortunately, the characters he gets to choose from are \"Accountant,\" \"Sick Old Woman,\" \"Little Girl,\" \"Puppy\" and \"HerbaPet.\"","popularity":0.927,"poster_path":"/9pS5WejgrQzdoVPlV45lWneklWf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5682,"logo_path":"/k7qkWyMVUUqJGg84kR8JWQBB1g1.png","name":"O Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":89136,"logo_path":"/5w19JCYpAshGGSIh1fTgwswl4DC.png","name":"DNA Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"steve.oedekerk.com","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
