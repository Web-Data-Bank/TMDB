She never ceases - she who is a duchess - to reproach the latter for his low origins. One morning, at dawn, while he comes home \"well watered\", he is surprised with a comrade at the bottom of a bathtub. Taken for a homosexual, overwhelmed by Step-Mom, he will never stop trying to escape her and will end up, after many adventures, by learning a somewhat embarrassing secret about the pseudo-nobility of his step-family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tdECkHPlTXuGxOasN9fAkX0CRiU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"4 A.M.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
