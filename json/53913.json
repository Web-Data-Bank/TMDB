Only as the night progresses do we realize that the Machiavellian machinations of the family are actually drawing the burglars further and further into their nefarious familial schemes, until reality blurs, and we no longer know who we should be rooting for: the family, or the burglars.","popularity":1.012,"poster_path":"/krSNWvixBP95rpmeCzUJjxaaSN6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Benson Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lovers, Liars and Lunatics","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
