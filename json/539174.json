This time, Leung puts on omega hair and woman's clothing, posing as a rich woman in order to help his two friends get love. Liu is equally amusing, sharing the dance floor with Leung in a hilarious dance scene. Loosely based on the British play Charley's Aunt, the film is a delightful comedy on grassroots, offering a refreshing alternative to MP & GI's usual line of comedies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/abBFPsfnv7L5PqaAvvPBUNTTjFV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Picture \u0026 General Investment Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Love Affair on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
