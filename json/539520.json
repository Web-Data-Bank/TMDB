It uses prominent music by Goblin, from other composers too and itÂ´s his only one that was made in original Dutch language. The idea of plot wafts around a book that may have the power to call up the flesh loving undead, inspired by \"Evil Dead\" and the work by George Romero.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eQtahpM3SoW7XrhAXblxPoCrvnI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1984-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pandora","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
