Called the Hades Stone, it allows the dead to pass through a portal into the world of the living. No one has entered the portal, but evil things have emerged: phantoms, demons, and an ancient being known as the Stone Keeper, guardian of the Hades Stone. The Stone Keeper and his stone demons promptly attack, killing the entire crew and commandeering the submarine. Now, it is up to the elite Phantom Force team to stop him.","popularity":1.804,"poster_path":"/rU1DdDACXs7F8oPTcokqSVKYfJo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4190,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Film Organization","origin_country":""},{"id":65383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Equity Pictures Medienfonds GmbH \u0026 Co.
