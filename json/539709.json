I spent three weeks traveling from city to city in the rainy and gloomy weather of Russia. As you know, by the November, Russia is approaching winter and the weather can be quite unpredictable as it was for me. Instead of dwelling on bad weather, I decided to go out and capture the cities of Russia as it is while taking advantage of the approaching winter and went up to the Arctic Circle to witness the northern lights. It was probably one of the cheapest place in the world to do so.  After Murmansk, I went down and spent a week each in St Petersburg and Moscow to capture the \"Life Out of Balance\" of Russian cities. Yes, you are not mistaken. This video was fully inspired by the great documentary, Koyaanisqatsi, Life Out of Balance directed by Godfrey Reggio and the music composed by Philip Glass.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/raGR7xj9ymgAaYtckQaPDTjlF8E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
