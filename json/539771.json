After accidentally murdering a ganglord one night, the two are taken under the wing of a group of thugs who populate the Bronx, a tough neighborhood run by a Mafia-like organization. Toussaint is able to scale the ranks of the neighborhood hierarchy, while Nixon ends up in jail for burglary, and is only released after Toussaint raises the money to free him. Eventually, the friends move on to Barbes, an even rougher neighborhood where they find that it takes more than just friendship to survive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kGf7l2gYR57eVTsdqPqO150MJIE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":582,"logo_path":"/bEORFnCh6xQ3oQuY6yX6mRRCLvW.png","name":"Hachette Première","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bronx-Barbès","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
