Springing from the creative mind of trans director, writer, and animator Clement Hil Goldberg, this multimedia and multidisciplinary satire envisions both near-extinct lemurs and long-lost Lemuria. Lemuria (a precursor to the occult city of Atlantis) was an imagined site of catastrophic loss populated by Lemurians, queer prehistoric entities that went extinct alongside the Atlanteans. Goldberg’s work illuminates the at-risk nature of queer spaces as well as the world’s most endangered mammal, the lemur. While Lemurians confront their crystals, pill-popping lemurs struggle to survive as parallel extinction stories unfold through stop-motion animation, and live performance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pdXs2Z3hy3gGNt4d5yaFBaHWMfp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Future Ends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
