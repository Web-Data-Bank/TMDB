More than the ubiquitous \"history of Harley\" type documentaries, this move looks at the entire culture of motorcycling from the 60's &amp; 70's and covers road racing, motocross &amp; desert racing, drag racing, trials and more. The viewer gets to see in action the famous racers we had only previously seen in photos and even ride along with Mike \"The Bike\" Hailwood on a 190 MPH lap of the Isle of Mann. If you liked the requisite motorcycle movie \"On Any Sunday,\" you'll LOVE this one. The soundtrack, with songs by Foreigner and Arlo Guthrie, is nostalgically cool too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Motorcycle Odyssey...Experience It.","title":"Take It to the Limit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
