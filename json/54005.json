Grab a seat in their classic Mustang convertible as they set out on their very first road trip, to the Winter Games in Utah. Cute outfits, even cuter guys. And all kinds of friends along the way. But watch for Olympic-size detours. Will they ever make it to the velvet-smooth ski slopes and posh Stein Ericksen Lodge at Deer Valley and the big-air snowboarding at Park City? Will they be on time for the Winter Games? See for yourself why half the fun is getting there.","popularity":6.507,"poster_path":"/9MDDTvaiksJycSi1EMZSBvUndcw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6130,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dualstar Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sweet 16 and Licensed to Drive","title":"Getting There","video":false,"vote_average":5.741,"vote_count":133}
