He tells me that he has nothing to do with cinema, that he actually hates cinema - too violent for him. I invite him to a projection of my portrait film Isa en automne, which screens at \"Studio 43\" the next day, \"... then we'll talk about it again ...\". He comes to the screening, he likes the movie, he says OK. The next afternoon at the Jardin des Plantes for the shoot, he comes. He is here before the hour. Few words exchanged, almost everything goes through the eyes. He gives himself to my camera. He concentrates and he abandons himself.  He becomes Sauro Bellini, angel of Venice .","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tYKBhoprrb9uRYDSeZ5NW70RMGA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sauro Bellini","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
