The viewer is introduced to a limited range of images (a snowy day in Harrow, walking to the Metropolitan Line station) shown in brief fade-ins and outs or quick flashes. For most of the film, the screen remains white. This is a film about the light of the projector, the white screen and the white image which emerges out of it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aVaswcYQ4pO1hQNEDmdopFUx4Im.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind White Duration","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
