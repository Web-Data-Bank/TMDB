Set in 1960s Soho, the film delves into the world of UK and US organised crime, with gangland figures such as the Krays, boxing, gambling, police corruption and a string of brutal unsolved murders that would become synonymous with the name Freddie Mills. With access to eight hours of previously unseen home movies, this is an intimate portrayal of a man who rose from the humble surroundings of the fairground boxing booth to become world light-heavyweight champion and became a household name appearing on television and in films. But it all ended on 25 July 1965, when he was found shot dead in the back seat of his car.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/azgqa2bdRrCQFhweL85bJGZtn1z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder in Soho: Who Killed Freddie Mills?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
