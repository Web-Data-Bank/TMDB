The film begins with a series of old and contemporary photographs, cut to a rhythm, which echoes that of monotony. A fragmented dialogue creates a feeling of alienation and lack of control (often identified with the labour process), interrupting further sequences of live action and images. “Feeling strongly that women's work is continuous, I realised that the film work could only be seen after work or in moments of non-work which I hesitate to call leisure. With this in mind I tried to bring this contradiction to the surface within the film itself”' (Susan Stein)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3LseYAUWsj6v5M2AqtRtUk5Ne1o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Said","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
