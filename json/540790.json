I got to know the women, took my Bolex (a wind-up camera) and after a while I felt comfortable enough to start filming. It made me aware of the way in which documentaries can be a form of control. On the one hand, it was a straightforward documentary and, on the other, it questioned my role as maker. It took a long time to make and was extremely rigorous.” (Alia Syed)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/huwkmB209en8sr1PMzt6GZ367cC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unfolding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
