The film’s speed suggests the idea of an impermanent flux, attempting to create a transient, felt experience. Variant “pushes to experiential and formal extremes the deployment of schematic and repetitive structures.” (Federico Windhausen)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sRtaqFC5KctDB6wH91pzmiQOxzI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Variant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
