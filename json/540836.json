There alone, she indeed comes across an assortment of peculiar characters, including her driver and most obsessive fan, his explosively jealous wife, and the progressively more unhinged man who owns the farm that’s hosting her. Totally out of place in her new surroundings—for one, she is always dressed for glamorous, big-city life—Robin discovers just how dangerous these oddballs may be. The unpredictable debut feature by Patrick von Barkenberg (who also appears as Robin’s boyfriend) is bathed in dreamy atmospherics and streaked with offbeat humor, but remains grounded throughout by Winter, who holds your attention rapt.","popularity":2.071,"poster_path":"/xlRgnrpXaUYhTV9eN3gyR3ydd8p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Von Barkenberg Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":8}
