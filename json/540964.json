From humble beginnings and overcoming much adversity, they were labelled the Skid Kids and would gain worldwide attention for their reckless, no-holds-barred approach to surfing Shark Island, a wave previously deemed unrideable. Driven by the desire to push the limits in both wave-riding and life, the Skid Kids revolutionised board design, created innovative competitions and became infamous for their wild antics both in and out of the water. A classic Australian coming of age story, Holding On features never-before-seen footage and a killer soundtrack supervised by Parkway Drive’s Winston McCall.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6ZhM1X5kRWZfXGy87pWNbrtGkoc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Holding On","title":"Holding On","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
