This production, videotaped in color, included original Broadway cast members Burnett, Gilford and White, and also featured Bernadette Peters as Lady Larken, Ken Berry as Prince Dauntless, Ron Husmann as Harry, and Wally Cox as The Jester. It was directed by Ron Field and Dave Powers. Again, several songs were eliminated and characters were combined or altered. Since the parts of the Minstrel and the Wizard were cut from this adaptation, a new prologue was written with Burnett singing \"Many Moons Ago\" as a bedtime story.","popularity":0.665,"poster_path":"/9863ee8xJNJYFJyCGi4t8dYF5DW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1081,"logo_path":"/19kn4jVvpc3sAL3YpZNb3elhSMl.png","name":"CBS Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The second television adaptation of the Broadway classic.","title":"Once Upon a Mattress","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
