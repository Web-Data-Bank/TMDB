Max was dreadfully afraid of dogs anyhow, and of these dogs in particular, because they were jealous when their mistress caressed Max. On the wedding day he had them locked up, but they escaped and ran to the parlor, where the ceremony was in progress. Max fled through numberless streets, houses, rooms, and finally to the roof, where he gave up and sent back a note by the dogs declining to marry and be devoured. The picture amuses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1910-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trop aimée","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
