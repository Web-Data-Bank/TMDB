In this programme, produced from films made by railway enthusiasts who visited the island from the 1950s to the present day, we present aspects of the changing face of the island s railways over the last forty years. We begin with John Laird s 1964 films of the steam railway in all its glory with the coverage of the lines to Ventnor and Cowes. This is contrasted with the scene in the 1950s as portrayed in rare colour films made in 1953 on the soon to be closed lines from Brading to Bembridge, Sandown to Merstone and Newport and from Newport to Freshwater. The final steam sequences filmed by Geoff Todd and Derek Norman show the last years of steam operation on the island and the preparations for electrification. The Isle of Wight s new tube trains are shown at first on trial on the mainland, looking quite incongruous at locations such as Clapham Junction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fU5x42L4jYfw3YeVz1bRqDjygIT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Demand Media Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vol 2 - Rails on the Isle of Wight","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
