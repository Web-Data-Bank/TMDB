Both ex-GWR diesel railcars and steam locomotives are seen before we head across the River Severn to explore the branch to Tenbury Wells and Woofferton. Moving into Wales itself the programme then features the lines centred on Brecon which closed in 1962. Starting from Neath Riverside station, the former Neath & Brecon line is followed up to Brecon. The next section features the former Brecon & Merthyr system including the notorious 7 mile bank beyond Talybont on Usk, one of the most challenging inclines on a British railway. We then follow the line north from Talyllyn Junction near Brecon to Three Cocks Junction and on to Hay on Wye along the former Midland route to Hereford before going up the Cambrian line through mid Wales to Builth Road Low Level where this line passed under the Central Wales Line.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rwdNAGmvVuGh3NmOs5TUA7TjBUD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Demand Media Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vol 4 - From Bewdley to Blaenau","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
