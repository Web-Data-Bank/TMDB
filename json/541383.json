The artist returns to the scene of the memory to search for evidence of her existence. The entire film is rendered by computer software and is filmed in one shot from beginning to end, like a roamer roams about through a dream, where dreamland and one’s memories interweave in fabrication and deviation. This film is an overture from the project Corner of the Park, continuing the work which was done years ago. The project sets out to form a complex labyrinth-style network of narratives regarding memory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ylzvcln1vCD6lcgRKhPJxQ5P2Gd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2017-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ulysses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
