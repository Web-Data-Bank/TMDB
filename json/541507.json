Emily believes it came from her head baker, a hot young man who mistakenly believes Emily wrote the poem to him! This leads to a whirlwind affair until she learns he had nothing to do with the poem at all... And now it's gone, stolen by a delivery boy out to impress the girl of his dreams. The poem makes the rounds and affects the love and sex lives of everyone in town: The Chief of Police, college students, a tenured professor and an art history major back home from studies abroad. It's a life-changer for some, an awakening for others, and an aphrodisiac for them all.","popularity":2.104,"poster_path":"/lC6qlYrY9Z2qRQMwQUoiDjU89N9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1891,"logo_path":"/8wZFrxv9YsWUeqdRa2k33xBABLQ.png","name":"Adam \u0026 Eve","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Sensual Love Poem, Whirlwind Affairs, and a Town Turned Upside Down.","title":"Love, Anonymous","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
