But as the country descends into civil war and the utopian hopes of the “Arab Spring” begin to fade, can they realise their dream? And is there even a country left to play for? Freedom Fields is a film about hope and sacrifice in a land where dreams seem a luxury. Through the eyes of these accidental activists we see the reality of a country in transition, where the personal stories of love, struggle and aspirations collide with History.","popularity":1.518,"poster_path":"/bd7l679TdyNsBYmRIUcNNGfBCaq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147028,"logo_path":null,"name":"HuNa Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":147029,"logo_path":null,"name":"SDI Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":97989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scottish Documentary Institute","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"LY","name":"Libyan Arab Jamahiriya"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom Fields","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4}
