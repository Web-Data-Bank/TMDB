Cecil Hepworth's 1909 film is the first of many taken in this tract of ancient woodland. The proximity to film studios - Pinewood, Shepperton and Bray - make this a favoured spot for filming. But before the studios were there, the Hepworth Company produced this extraordinary 'stereo scenic' - intended as a filmic equivalent of Victorian stereo cards. This is one of a series of tourist attractions filmed by Gaston Quiribet in a long panning shot from a car, to suggest the glorious photography and aesthetic experience of stereoscopy.  -BFI","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oAaU2vCQa9jqjMNumiXiapGpjax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hepworth","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1909-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burnham Beeches","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
