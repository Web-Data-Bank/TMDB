Over two days, they wake, shower, breakfast, play dress up, bathe in the sea, picnic, ride bikes, pick flowers, have a pillow fight, run on the strand, practice ballet stretches, groom themselves and each other, and laugh. Anne returns a horse to Renaud; the next day, he's in a rowboat and meets her by the pier. By the film's end, all are celebrating with the lovers.","popularity":3.325,"poster_path":"/kBEOMZseyxxM5U3TwA6mL54Pe4a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182,"logo_path":null,"name":"JVC","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Summer in St. Tropez","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":19}
