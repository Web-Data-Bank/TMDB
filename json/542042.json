Born on the ruins of the ancient Greek city of Triokala, its name depends on the three gifts received from Mother Nature: the fertility of its countryside, the sweetness of the water and the ancient fortress on the lace of the mountain, which made the place impregnable, protecting the inhabitants from evil. Over the centuries, the traces of that knowledge somewhere between magic, religion and superstition have been lost in the fog. But you can still recognize the faces of its people, in their relationship with the animal and plant world, in many religious and pagan rituals, an ancient knowledge that marks, even today, the time and the relationship between man and nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hM1LUAYmlg1pZ3IGcEgWZhd5hMm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triokala: The Three Gifts of Nature","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
