When team owner Mike Ilitch moved the Tigers into Comerica Park in 2000 with the help of public funds, it marked the end of an era -- but it didn't erase the affection many fans still hold for one of America's last remaining classic-era ballparks. This documentary celebrates Tiger Stadium's rich history, recounts the long struggle to keep the team from abandoning the old park, and takes a critical look at its current state of neglect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l0OWRUn6g9NkLKIBVbbmx7cw8ir.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Battle To Save Historic Tiger Stadium","title":"Stranded at the Corner","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
