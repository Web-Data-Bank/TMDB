There, she shares a room with five other girls and takes part in the daily activities, which include games on the beach and lots of sports. At first she hangs back, hesitant, but she quickly finds her place in the group. She makes new friends, flirts with boys at the camp, dances in the evenings to loud music and shares secrets with her roommates. But it’s not so easy for everyone to find a place in the social structure of the camp. For Polina, the summer camp isn’t as warm and friendly as she’d hoped. Failing to connect with the other girls and feeling homesick, she withdraws into her own world. Paper Stars is a Russian coming-of-age film that, thanks to its direct camera style, is able to present an intimate, sensitive impression of teenage girls in a new environment where they feel unsure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lHSuZ3vvDpbvtdVQDPrt7WRPe1q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102208,"logo_path":"/m3NGbr5cr4XIF80L7BZzccEUsVl.png","name":"M.
