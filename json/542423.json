This Robin-Hoodesque figure would steal primarily livestock from the white settler farmers, terrorizing them for over a decade. Led by the hardliner General Botha, a mammoth manhunt ensues in the very mountain where Kepe was rumored to occupy a Noah's Ark like cave. This spectacle ingratiated Kepe in the hearts of the marginalized indigenous-population, who turn Kepe's miscreant deeds into the stuff of legend, making him a threat to the very fabric of the colonial society. Sew the Winter to my Skin is a thrilling, operatic ride into the heart of Pre-Apartheid South Africa and is a visceral exploration of the effects of the colonial displacement that sewed the seeds for one of the most viciously racist, political regimes in history.","popularity":1.287,"poster_path":"/AnC5kFnayIYPRlJa5TRyRG0pHqZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yellowbone Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2019-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Man's Bandit is Another Man's Champion","title":"Sew the Winter to My Skin","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
