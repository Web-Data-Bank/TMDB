Produced in 1893 as Verdi turned 80 there is much in this masterpiece that can be identified as a modernist neoclassical work. The use of short motifs instead of long arioso melodic lines, the spry and reduced orchestral textures and the lack of a single 'stand and deliver' dramatic declamatory aria all serve to make this more of a 20th century work than an example of 19th century late-Romanticism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e8rGZ1QMx1FP2Ob1on5ydhQi0tS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falstaff","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2}
