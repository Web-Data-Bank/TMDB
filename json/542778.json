During the honeymoon, Rodolfo gets to know his wife's hidden side - nymphomania. Márcia breeds cantharids (green-gold insects with reddish tinges, often used for diuretic or aphrodisiac purposes) and forces her husband to eat them daily. Rodolfo feels the need to have interminable sex. Discovering the ideal way to have sex, Márcia inserts cantharis in everything her husband eats, creating jams, cakes, pies and juices from these insects with aphrodisiac power, increasing their sexual appetite.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cKWMg5nXXcVptO4p2KLW9jaVIHO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1984-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penetrações Profundas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
