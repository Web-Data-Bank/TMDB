However, they are actually members of an extraterrestrial race called the \"Blood Tribe\" (the same species as Evolto), who assumed their government positions as part of a plan to destroy Earth as they have done to Mars and other planets before. Considering Sento Kiryū (Kamen Rider Build) a major threat to their plans, the Blood Tribe manipulates his friends and other civilians into attacking him. With even his close ally Ryūga Banjō (Kamen Rider Cross-Z) now against him, Sento must fight to survive and stop the Blood Tribe's plan from succeeding.","popularity":6.167,"poster_path":"/i8qAIvjYzzJio4mBf6OXkd3ML8i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":8670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ishinomori Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-08-04","revenue":92108679,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To build the future, there is only one answer.","title":"Kamen Rider Build The Movie: Be The One","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5}
