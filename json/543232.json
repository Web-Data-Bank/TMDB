The movie integrates heterogeneous languages seemingly incompatible: the sociological national repertoire and original performance art specifically designed for this project. At the center the movie is an Ophelia who is different from any literary tradition: not the fragile teenager in love with Hamlet, but many women of different colors, features and ages. A modern contemporary Ophelia, very sweet but also cynical. Our Ophelia is not lost in the woods of Denmark, but in the countryside of Lazio, from the Gazometro to the junkyard in Cisterna di Latina, from the arid limestone caves of Riano Flaminio to the wonderful futuristic Villa Perugini in Fregene, passing through another thrilling scenic ride on a tourist bus in Rome. our Ophelia eventually does not drown, renouncing her destiny of romantic heroine to become a \"normal person\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xDmxCVlHrPNUuk4imUqCCpP21YO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ophelia Did Not Drown","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
