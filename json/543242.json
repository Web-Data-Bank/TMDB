At the heart of Weed Killer is a monologue—adapted from Lord’s moving and often irreverent book—in which an actress reflects upon the chemically induced devastation of chemotherapy. This monologue is intertwined with comparatively otherworldly sequences, including choreographic gestures shot with high-definition thermal imaging. The film suggests a complex relationship to one’s own suffering and draws into focus the fine line between alternately poisonous and curative substances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n2cCBajqpZHthCLtyYkDv7I7fgL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weed Killer","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
