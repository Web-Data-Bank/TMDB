A cow crosses the road. The driver hits the breaks. Just in time. Or maybe too late. Nothing will be the same again. He tries to return to his old life, his home, his wife; but all that was hidden beneath the surface is now out in the open. Death is everywhere, in his chicken coop, in his marriage, inside of him.
