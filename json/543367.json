Some have it, some don't, and Paul, an unpredictable loner, falls into the latter category. A frustrated creative living a dead end life, Paul is at odds with everything in his environment and with himself. When he reaches out to Anna, a seemingly kindred spirit who lives across the hall, could things be changing for him? With a distinctive sharp wit and visual expression, the film explores the complexities of 21st century relationships and the fine line between acceptance of others and settling for less.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3hlhkou2AZwlepDHL9re1nhatUz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109958,"logo_path":null,"name":"CR Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just don't be yourself, and you'll be fine.","title":"Je Ne Sais Quoi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
