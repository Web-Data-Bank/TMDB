They had no budget and no plan, but they did have a yellow van, a camera and each other. During the months ahead they would have all their assumptions challenged as daily the first hand experience of looking at the lives of refugees transformed perspectives learnt through the media. From dropping the cameras to help those arriving on the shores of Lesvos, to witnessing the closure of the borders of Europe, to being arrested in the mountains of the Balkans, the journey would transform their lives. In an environment of fear, hatred and suspicion in Europe, \"The March of Hope\" is a celebration of everything which makes us human, and a challenge in film to the xenophobia growing in modern Europe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The March of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
