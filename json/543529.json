The film offers an intimate look into the everyday lives of four deaf kindergartners, featuring newcomer Lija Gurung. From her inaugural step into the classroom through her first six months of school, the film follows Lija's journey as she forms friendships, learns sign language, and slowly integrates into her new world. The filmmaker's meditative presence and deep love for the children is made manifest in a tender, compelling portrait of Lija and her classmates, allowing very personal access to this pint-sized world filled with curiosity and exploration. -IMDB","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uZ2Xehbok6w5wJyQ5VdJLrUUBms.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shape of Things","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
