They shout “We are the people!” They claim “Merkel must go!” The director Sabine Michel accompanied them for one year – on their demonstrations and in their daily lives. Merkel Must Go is not a film about PEGIDA, it asks for the personal reasons for this patriotic protest, a film about realistic and absurd fears of the present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iXfn1bWTlksEUgYGpmRIdUxK3qE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merkel Must Go","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
