Despite doctor's grim prognosis over the next 16 years Aaron decided not to listen to those who said 'he had a million-to-one odds of ever feeding himself again' and instead, through painstaking effort, endeavored to regain as much mobility as possible. This journey through the unknown took him from the depths of depression to the joys of cross country road tripping via tandem bicycle with his mother and friends, and finally, culminated in his opening a socially conscious low cost gym focused on increasing mobility for the disabled. Now in Coming To My Senses we watch as Aaron takes one final journey which symbolizes his recovery: to cross a 20 mile tract of Death Valley unsupported on foot. But will he make it?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2DpBHNL2Rj5UNZZ3kpxn7EwTzy1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coming To My Senses","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
