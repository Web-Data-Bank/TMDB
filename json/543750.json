It's in this setting that we find our hero Chase Daylight, whose dream to play in the professional Rugby League is falling by the wayside, just like his relationship to Brooke. At his lowest point, Chase takes a leap of faith to sort out his life. But living this out is a far greater challenge than he imagined, especially among team mates who won't let him give up his partying ways without a fight. Chase's leap of faith might possibly be the worst decision ever he has ever made.","popularity":1.5,"poster_path":"/1FettyEAjjDcMlUClNeeNcHPtER.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jason Stevens Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7584,"logo_path":"/eGkfvvyf4fJTvBUR1xt1669IPA3.png","name":"Screen Australia","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2018-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on a True Story...kinda.","title":"Chasing Comets","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
