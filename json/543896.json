Images of ruin and destruction from places that only recently were the scenes of fighting are transformed into a tragicomic parable of survival in a provisional space-time. Looting is a daily occurrence, and going out in search of booty becomes a boyish adventure during which the participants explore places only recently inhabited by private individuals. And when all this is recorded by a Polish television crew headed by a canny female reporter, an existential satire is born. The war is there, but somewhere around the corner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aUXKSMgVUdsm4X2omqRie3h9mH4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is a War, Baby","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
