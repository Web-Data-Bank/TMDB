Kirkland came to Denver in 1929 as founding Director of the University of Denver's School of Art. This documentary demonstrates that one can be a great artist regardless of location or other career. From his mountain landscapes to his surreal worlds, to his final abstractions -- a cosmos of glowing energy -- Kirkland found his visual langage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wmoluyqqOzQWdDBDSbjrienA9AB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Work and Life of Colorado's Distinguished Painter","title":"Vance Kirkland's Visual Language","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
