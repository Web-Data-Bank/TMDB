She fantasies about living in its futuristic ideals, and keeps a separate DVD copy in a strongbox under the house just to be on the safe side. Naturally, this drives her unattended husband to the local whorehouse, known as The Village of the Moon. There, he meets up with other unhappy men and drowns his sorrows in high priced call girls. In the meantime, Baby Swiss discovers a kind of platonic love with a like minded neighbor. He is so desperate to be part of her life that he will wait outside her window. Their relationship will turn on whether she cleans the glass, or closes the blinds. And all the while, a homeless Greek chorus champions the freedom of living on the streets, unencumbered by the mindless machinations of being part of this so-called “proper society”\" (review excerpt by Bill Gibron)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l2LSVlbBwyXBvkAKOH0OZNm25yc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Airplane Pillows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
