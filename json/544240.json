Naturally, this causes concern among his friends and family, including: a father whose stuck in a psychological warp involving mountain lions and tuxedos; an uncle whose had his blood replaced by coconut water; a brother who believes he’s unfit to be a dad; a newlywed neighbor whose obsessed with opossums; and another who wants to use his available land to construct a cemetery (for people or pets). Taking his issues to a local therapist, he finds some solace. Still looking for enlightenment, however, he seeks out a meditation guru who has a unique take on the practice. Finally content to be part of the process, not necessarily the cure, Pierogi tries to act as mediator between his warring relatives and the toxins tripping through his body. It’s quite a journey.\" (review excerpt by Bill Gibron)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/PZCTpEOEIG9Jm9pbzS38MPnaXd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
