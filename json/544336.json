Serious criminal charges followed, including car theft. He was, literally, in the inmate audience in 1959, when Johnny Cash gave his New Year’s Day concert in San Quentin – and, as he’s said repeatedly, “my life changed forever.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lCsszpmHLGFFDmNAsFZJq6xUxIh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10492,"logo_path":"/3fcHNVpW66wgG6o0cgFJlcP8cCg.png","name":"Thirteen","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eagle Rock Film \u0026 TV Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":108110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spothouse GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merle Haggard: Learning to Live With Myself","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
