Both a religious sanctuary and a sports site, Olympia was, for nearly one thousand years, host to the most prestigious games in Ancient Greece. Using reconstructions and 3D computer imagery, this documentary by Olivier Lemaître brings the past wonders of Olympia to life and immerses the viewer in the cradle of the Olympic Games.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nfiH4in3yb9ae72r8rqAQumTbY7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Séquana Média","origin_country":""},{"id":41158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalisté Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olympia, the Origins of the Games","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
