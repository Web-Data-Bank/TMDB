In February, 2009, about 400,000 people gathered in Myung Dong for a brief meeting for a single reason. The late cardinal KIM Sou-hwan became the first cardinal in a land of poor faith. He summoned up his courage when no one took action. He practiced love as a miracle until he left us. He was a respected senior of the society beyond the religion in the turbulent times; a figure whose life had been like a fence for the disadvantaged. The late cardinal KIM Sou-hwan was ‘a great man of the era’. His passionate love is now revived on the screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tSNclOm4zkQafhn8yuV0lAm8AbU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baboya","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
