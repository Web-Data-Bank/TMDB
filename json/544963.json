While Howard at first rejected traditional cancer treatments in favor of alternative therapy, and then embraced chemotherapy and liver transplants as last-ditch attempts to save his life, the film's ultimate focus is on Howard's spiritual progression as he adjusts to the notion of his passing. \"Death: A Love Story\" was enthusiastically received when screened at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/i8zmQ72uen9dRaPcXVuKdJ6TW86.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death: A Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
