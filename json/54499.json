The limo was rigged with digital cameras, a computer, a television, a stereo, and a cell phone. Generated entirely by this four-wheeled media machine, No Maps for These Territories is both an account of Gibsonâ€™s life and work and a commentary on the world outside the car windows. Here, the man who coined the word \"cyberspace\" offers a unique perspective on Western culture at the edge of the new millennium, and in the throes of convulsive, tech-driven change.","popularity":2.342,"poster_path":"/329157hdloFLqZzyq7BoFQKEszS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"William Gibson: No Maps for These Territories","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7}
