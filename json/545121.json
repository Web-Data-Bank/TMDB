Both Iimuras play individually as well as a unit. In \"Double Portrait\" they are never together, but one by one in three points of view, front, side, and back, assigned to the words \"I\", \"You\" and \"He/She\" respectively. The pronouns rotate with every repetition, for instance, in front view with \"You\", then \"He/She\" and back to \"I\". Often the words are destroyed acoustically making them unintelligible. \"I Love You\" is not a style of confession, but the words, and a linguistic  practice using a sentence and shifting the pronouns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nnYjqHAxbKslY0hOPOxzeEirZ9u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
