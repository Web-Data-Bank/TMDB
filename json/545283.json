With known but also never published archival materials from the whole Europe and Russia we tell a family story of the director Anna Kryvenko about how the big politics is destroying the lives of ordinary people. Just couple of years ago the director found a family secret of her grand-uncle who came to occupy Czechoslovakia in 1968 as a Soviet soldier. When searching for grand-uncle's story the author touches themes like fragmentation of personal and national memory, inherited guilt, interpretation of history, media manipulation, relationship towards nowadays Russia, but also relationship of Czechs and Slovaks towards foreigners - themes very actual in our times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wNfwuwLD87G9C2GuVha7hmfxm4e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Analog Vision","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":74637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baltic Pine Films","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":92295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wandal Production","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":24023,"logo_path":"/yz6m1ty4qGvlkfReuqPZxdmD8V2.png","name":"RTVS","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2018-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Unknown Soldier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
