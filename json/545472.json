Overwhelmed with emotions, she fails the audition, but manages to convince the director to go out for a walk, which then transforms his day into a pleasant evening spent in her company. The desire for love shared by the two single souls jump starts the clockworks of a miracle, which for some reason fails to develop. A classical tale of how everything that transpires with a girl happens mostly inside her head.","popularity":1.345,"poster_path":"/szZLpzJ58zTCvSlxrHBBMknGfQn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102867,"logo_path":"/mlIBTCf8DzAOfoBt9VgjA8iB8YA.png","name":"Moscow School of New Cinema","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2015-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like Life Without Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
