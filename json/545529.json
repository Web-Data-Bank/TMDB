FIRE MUSIC showcases the architects of a movement whose radical brand of improvisation pushed harmonic and rhythmic boundaries, and produced landmark albums like Coleman's Free Jazz: A Collective Inspiration and Coltrane's Ascension. A rich trove of archival footage conjures the 1960s jazz scene along with incisive reflections by critic Gary Giddins and a number of the movement's key players.","popularity":0.713,"poster_path":"/polpaEFNQnihvh1w1fgPSeE5N6d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A history of the free jazz revolution.","title":"Fire Music","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
