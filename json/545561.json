This is hard enough in any big city – never mind in Tehran, where individual freedoms can’t be taken for granted. In a sexy voice on the telephone, an overweight receptionist seduces men who wouldn’t look twice at her real ‘me’. A former bodybuilding champion now earns a living as a personal trainer. When he gets a promising young sportsman as a client, he drops everything else; even a very promising acting job for a well-known French director. A singer at religious funerals is dumped by his fiancée. He tries to find new purpose in life by retraining as a singer at weddings and parties. That’s a lot more attractive to women, his friend assures him.","popularity":0.933,"poster_path":"/s2vUour9zXSzHQg9wGxo1ubeE63.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Here \u0026 There Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":44438,"logo_path":"/mnoDqJffaYKJmOQ6plRZYksZPXF.png","name":"Viking Film","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":137066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kavir Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tehran: City of Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
