Taiwanese photographer Lin Li-Fang undertook a solo journey up 4,270 meters into the Himalayan Plateau and lived for an entire summer with some of these nuns and recorded life in the unforgiving environment dubbed “The Roof of the World”. There, Li-fang captured a life devoted to hope and faith and a people possessing a unique kind of tolerance, humility, and perseverance.  This is a story of the Nuns of the Himalayas, of seeing one’s life through theirs, that is, a life lived in faith and with the spark of a summer eternal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pJChFBPmJe2PnjIJrukIgJGQEX7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tsunma, Tsunma: My Summer with the Female Monastics of the Himalaya","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
