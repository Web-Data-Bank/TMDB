There are bits of black and white film from his childhood spending holidays in Italyas a boy.\r The audience adores him and his voice soars easily as such songs are easy on someone used to much heavier Verdi or Wagner roles. A delight to the ear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aIWWVHe9duh0xQhOo35OX54qu7F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jonas Kaufmann: Dolce Vita","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
