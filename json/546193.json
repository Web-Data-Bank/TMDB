Except that here - a single actor filmed in close-up on a plain black background. Nedjar \"wiggles\" his camera, with GaÃ«l Badaud manipulating a green net or a mirror, wearing a gas mask or covering his head with a red-skinned knit like a bloody balaclava, he inaugurates a search for luminous calligraphies that will soon be shared with Teo Hernandez.-- Dominique Noguez.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oP7siQtkiaCsP9U8kqs9BBBIQRE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1978-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gestuel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
