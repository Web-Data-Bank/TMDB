Now 32 years old and residing in an abandoned Uruguayan slaughterhouse, Rosa has become one of Hollywood's foremost composers, specialising in Westerns. He also has a beautiful 19-year-old fiancee, Esmeralda, but he pays her little heed, instead lavishing his attentions on a black mare named Bola. One day, a group of men attired as cowboys arrive at the abattoir and kill both Rosa and Bola; an investigation is conducted, with particular suspicion!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wPpLNJya74Oo4OZyPZjE2y8eaOU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1049,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kasander Film Company","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1999-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Death of a Composer: Rosa, a Horse Drama","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":0}
