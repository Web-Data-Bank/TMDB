This is the film that helped kick-off the anti-globalization movement. Upon its release, CONTROLLING INTEREST quickly became a standard \"audio-visual text\" for those concerned about the growing impact of multinational corporations on global affairs. The film examines how the ever-increasing concentration and velocity of capital affect employment in the U.S., shape patterns of development in the Third World, and influence our nation's foreign policy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ttI8uOdMOQ6Y6VE9dy0ElX6SPFt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102366,"logo_path":null,"name":"California Newsreel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Growth of Conglomerates and Their Influence on Global Affairs","title":"Controlling Interest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
