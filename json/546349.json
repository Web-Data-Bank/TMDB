It was one of Britain's deadliest maritime disasters, which tore through the heart of Hull's Hessle Road fishing community. The film tells the epic story of the Hull fishermen who did the most dangerous job in Britain and their wives whose protest ensured such a disaster never happened again. The women's campaign was one of the biggest and most successful civil action campaigns of the 20th century. Combining rare archive and emotional testimony - including that of Yvonne Blenkinsop, the last surviving leader of the women - those who lived through the tragedy and fought for change tell their incredible stories for the first time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j0WUHugImpeoplF8QolPUCDN7n1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hull's Headscarf Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
