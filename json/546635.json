The film is an exuberantly bizarre tale about two teenage girls who have so such affections to each other. However, a hidden camera finally destroys their fancy as the recorded contents unveil a possible truth that one of them is probably a male. The director has skillfully shown a dramatic shift of mood through the use of his cameras, from an atmosphere of exuberant teenage joy to a lost in one’s own sentiments. He has also blended several elements into his plot, such as the innocence of youth, some soap materials and a sense of horror. This definitely wakes up the sensations of its audience. And a mysterious male voice narration throughout the film always keeps people puzzled about the truth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oK4l8QRGgzy6lOH3axnF3HoUhnm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Is Not a Sin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
