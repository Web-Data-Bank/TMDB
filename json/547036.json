These are the thoughts of a daughter who cannot rebel. As a little girl, she spent a lot of time with her mother, a fervent Catholic woman. She would have rather spent time with her father, but he was busy hiding an extra-marital affair everyone knew but kept quiet about. Today, time goes by slowly inside and outside their home. Family problems are silenced, the Campania region suburbs lie on the background.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gvYxiRv1SteL3tnYXqw6BcoxbjU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Bad Things","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
