The film includes copious amounts of gore alongside a splattering of social commentary and several slices of dark humour. It’s best seen as a tribute to the cinema of Lucio Fulci and George Romero, but viewed from a distinctly Pakistani perspective.","popularity":1.038,"poster_path":"/1J3Ak36pHxhiQpqZoTKFXyklSfQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102216,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bubonic Films","origin_country":""},{"id":102217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mondo Macabro","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell's Ground","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":21}
