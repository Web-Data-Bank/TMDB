Live In Milan","overview":"This live R.E.M. concert, filmed in front of an intimate audience for MTV in Milan on March 18, 2008, has the band performing in a faster 'n louder form than many may suspect. Sure, they play a couple of hit staples (Drive, Man on the Moon, Losing My Religion), but this show is largely packed with raucous rockers from their energetic 2008 EP \"Accelerate\". The band kicks the show off with Living Well Is The Best Revenge, a new, swooshing, guttural rager, later, their fun new apocalypse party track (yes, you read that correctly) I'm Gonna DJ, the rousing Horse to Water, and the new, yet classic-sounding single Supernatural Superserious. R.E.M. also dig into the classics a bit with Begin the Begin from 1986, and the underrated 2001 single Imitation of Life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aeihj6VvZqtGLHSyMJthAuxQnu7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31077,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTV Italia","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"R.E.M.
