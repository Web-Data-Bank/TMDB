From then on they meet on every anniversary of the disaster to celebrate their survival. On an everyday basis they have their ups and downs. Lisowski works at the curia in a big city, has a career and is dreaming of the Vatican. Problem is, archbishop Mordowicz, an opulent church official who uses his political influence to build the largest sanctuary in Poland, gets in his way. The second priest, Trybus, is a village parson. He ministers to a poor community and gives in to human weaknesses more and more often. Kukuła is not faring well either. Despite his fervent faith, he loses the trust of his parishioners actually overnight. Soon the stories of the three clergymen are going to join once again.","popularity":7.308,"poster_path":"/ng11hk3cduAXHXcEYL8mCx6xkxt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Profil Film","origin_country":""},{"id":136559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Metrage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2018-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clergy","video":false,"vote_average":6.623,"vote_count":154}
