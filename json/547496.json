The trip, which seems directed from beyond by the dead woman, becomes a double adventure. A comic adventure, in which the ashes, first in an urn and then in a luxurious handbag, take center stage, and a dramatic adventure, that of the reunion of the friends with an old love of youth, their former coach of gymnastics, which will cause a decisive transformation in all of them. A reunion that will serve to close old wounds and overcome personal conflicts and to realize that after forty life has only just begun","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qKVT3KsyvtxFRPsS3s5JRQmoE4v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diagonal Televisión","origin_country":""},{"id":53491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Generalitat Valenciana","origin_country":""},{"id":196655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marvarrosa Media S.L","origin_country":""},{"id":10050,"logo_path":"/SowPJ8W5Gy6OgyAFyWnv4KjcPo.png","name":"TVG","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1000 ways to eat an egg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
