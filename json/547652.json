Orfeo (Stephanie Blythe) is so consumed with grief at the death of his beloved Euridice (Danielle de Niese) that the gods (Heidi Grant Murphy as Amor) allow him to lead her back from the underworld—if he will not look at her on the way. Of course he can’t resist looking, but the gods are truly merciful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/34m2yYv2SNM0wW5tmBEaRpzY2mW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gluck: Orfeo ed Euridice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
