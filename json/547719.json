The child often stays outside the locked door while the mother has fun with another guest. Tony wanders in the streets or walks to Pipe doll artist's studio. Here the girl is immersed in a fairy-tale world, very different from the one around her. But Fipo has his own life and problems. Tony is not mad at her mother, loves her and wants to live with her. But for neighboring children, Tony is a bad example. Their parents are doing their best to put her in a boarding school without being interested in her opinion.
