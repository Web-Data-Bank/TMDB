But the plot plays second fiddle to the comedic performances of stalwarts Wally Patch (one of Britain’s most prolific character actors) and the much-loved Margaret Rutherford. Patch and Vedey make a dynamic double-act whose clowning keeps the film zipping along, while Rutherford’s imperious proclamations on etiquette are priceless. Irene Handl adds some ooh-la-la to the role of a French maid, and director Carstairs ably keeps them all under control.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missing, Believed Married","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
