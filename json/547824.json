Finally there is a brilliant pinkish flare veined with curled blue lines which engenders a resolution between these (above described) alternating modes - colors in the straight-line sections, lines among the artifice of \"flowers,\" a kind of dark lattice-form which knits the two modes, gray and colored \"clouds\" which correlate them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xWweaDl17GzJtve8CT99lo2UbJ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beautiful Funerals","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
