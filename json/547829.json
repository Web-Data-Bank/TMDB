The third \"reel\" combines these scratches with some motion picture film, mostly of the ocean. The fifth reel is the only one which has a sound track; but of course that makes the whole work a \"SOUND film\" because the audio track must be turned-on from the beginning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/exUr63YO2jarpXqzBCg5aortgGt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"\"...\" Reel 4","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
