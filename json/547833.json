Her dance is visually 'echoed' by close-up superimpositions of her arms, legs, and feet, and then later by her distant figure seeming to mimic and/or perhaps to control her foregrounded, cometimes back-lit, image. She often pauses thoughtfully in her dance, breaks step, walks away, etc., defining the perimeters of the dance. Finally she appears naked, midst dance, and takes heraldic stance at end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
