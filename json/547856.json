The film lies at the fringe of the expanding Indian city, a world of continuous migration and therefore of continuous separations. It is in this terrain of separation that A Love Story is located. This film can also be seen as an offering to mainstream cinema, a space where we often lose ourselves in the repetitive spectacle of grand love stories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a5MFVRiYa2LLLVx6Hdb6TjmYsd6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
