This is all very fine for Phlipp, who is wont to bask in the radiance of her smiles and to sip the honey from her rose-leaved lips. But, alas! his bliss is short-lived, for, the perspicacious Mrs. Phlipp grows suspicious and surprises the erring couple in an osculatory diversion. The meretricious maiden is put to right, and the sinful Phlipp is assailed with most vociferous vituperative verbosity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1908-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yellow Peril","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
