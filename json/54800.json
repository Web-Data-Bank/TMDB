Lizzie feels sure that during the 184 seconds that she lay dead, something latched on to her and came back into her world. The nightmares and visions that follow only crystallize her belief that she should have died in the crash... Then the disturbances start, at first merely tappings and bad smells - but soon the activity escalates. Lizzie seems to be the focus, but according to others, she's just playing games for attention. Only when Kate, her mother, is confronted with inexplicable events does she face the possibility that they may be the victims of a poltergeist infestation","popularity":1.469,"poster_path":"/9CeNjXrL8M70puMlR62jQJ7C442.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Ghost Story","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":7}
