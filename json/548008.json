He is intelligent, but weak. He has had many trials. He was insulted and humiliated by a bully. A young man, but already strong and severe. What to do? To pass by with your tail between your legs? Or to commit an act at least once in life? And Peter Ivanovich dared: stole the boor, put him on a chain in his village house and began to re-educate, strongly trying to make this bully more human with the help of science, poetry, music. He made him a condition: if the prisoner passed the exam, he would be released. And if not, he would die... In a month of intensive studies, Vyazemsky makes the impossible: the bully becomes interested in studying! And the professor himself discovers a warm feeling for the object of his pedagogical experiment... And now he doesn't want to part with his new friend. For this he has to do the worst thing for an honest man - to break his word.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iaKPcgjyEIAPEn7LgXVlm2zWnE9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101779,"logo_path":"/p9Wx4zJw8AI3Vp46KydNbFy5Cuy.png","name":"VKSR","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confession of a Misanthrope","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
