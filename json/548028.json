This is neither future nor past, but rather somewhere lost. Somewhere other. The film uses a mix of 2D and CG animation to explore what happens to a lonely figure when a mysterious anomaly appears on the fringes of the landscape. It aims to capture the strange sense of ennui, loss and anxiety that feels appropriate for our times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hNZque5nFPXiWNHy1aMSOztEYVs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animation 2018","origin_country":""},{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":80495,"logo_path":"/ye7zbHuFbYDmMinkGX3GLXnbGZn.png","name":"Wingspan Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"//_sleeper","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
