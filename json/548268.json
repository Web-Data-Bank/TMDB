The cat walks across the table. In one smooth shot, we see there is still warmth in the large, secluded house of fresh widow Thea. Still, her son is worried about her. One stormy day, he drops by to check how his mom is doing. Wouldnâ€™t it be better if she moved to a nursing home or if he arranged home care? Thea resolutely rejects all suggestions. She does not need more care, she claims. The question is if this is really the case.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2u4j9eHssbvdbkg7EN8axwcae8T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108847,"logo_path":"/wXcInrUH3f5Vc2Ok13kURwUQ9Zv.png","name":"Keplerfilm","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":22294,"logo_path":"/xD7TJlNqBQM6KmdWyr22TUK1rCt.png","name":"NTR","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
