There would be three new teams: Adelaide, Freemantle and Port Adelaide. We would farewell Fitzroy and watch others like Footscray, Richmond, Melbourne and Hawthorn battle for their existence.  For the first time non-Victorian Clubs would take premiership honours. The West Coast winning twice and Malcolm Blight's Adelaide doing the seemingly impossible by winning back-to-back flags against the odds.  It was a decade in which the feats of goalkicking maestros Jason Dunstall and Gary Ablett were overshadowed by the record breaker Tony Lockett.  We marvelled at the great champions. Robert Harvey sealed his greatness with a pair of Brownlow medals. Wayne Carey was named All Australian captain three times and Carlton's veteran Craig Bradley just got better and better through the nineties.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wTQbdIyv5mEqlv6aIBeqYhCrJrd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70895,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual Entertainment Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1999-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 90s: The Decade that Delivered","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
