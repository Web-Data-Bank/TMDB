Now for the first time he talks about his dazzling career.  The only man to have won the Margarey - Brownlow - Coleman and Farmer medal quadrella. A Premiership star with North Melbourne and the man who broke through to take Adelaide to back to back flags as coach. Along the way there was a short lived stint as playing coach of the Roos, a return to Woodville and three near misses as coach of Geelong.  A remarkable man - a remarkable career.  In WINNING, Melcolm Blight gives a rare insight into the footballer, the coach, the television analyst and the family man. This is a story of success by a man who has been a master at it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sogwavCAfmd7yfXMumBLjRtqGZM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winning: The Malcolm Blight Story","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
