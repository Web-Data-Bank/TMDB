Braden was hailed by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his 1963 Letter from Birmingham Jail as a white southerner whose rejection of her segregationist upbringing was eloquent and prophetic. Ostracized as a red in the 1950s, she fought for an inclusive movement community and mentored three generations of social justice advocates. Braden’s story explores not only the dangers of racism and political repression but also the power of a woman’s life spent in commitment to social justice.","popularity":0.73,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Appalshop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Braden’s story explores not only the dangers of racism and political repression but also the power of a woman’s life spent in commitment to social justice.","title":"Anne Braden: Southern Patriot","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
