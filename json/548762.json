Adaś Miauczyński goes back to his childhood days when, like most of us, he used to find it problematic to name the emotions that accompanied him. To improve the quality of his adult life, he decides to return to that time – which proves not so carefree after all – to learn how to experience the seven basic emotions. This extremely unpredictable journey into the past features an abundance of hilarious, even comical, situations but is also filled with lots of touching moments and food for thought.","popularity":2.815,"poster_path":"/lLD7MvZUQR1BsaT55M5FcefTBzt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Orka","origin_country":""},{"id":37732,"logo_path":"/596Eq7ivA0DpNfB5zzDU7yMeTB4.png","name":"WFDiF","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We are all badly educated","title":"7 Emotions","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":49}
