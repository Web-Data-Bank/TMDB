Director Stephen Gammond gives us the cradle-to-grave view of Woody Guthrie as told by those who knew him, most memorably his daughter Nora, son Arlo, sister Mary Jo, and peer Pete Seeger. The folksinger's ability to mix politics with song and weave them together melodically is universally praised.","popularity":1.784,"poster_path":"/igIZIxtFAKCgBggevkirtxr9jCZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Machine Kills Fascists","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
