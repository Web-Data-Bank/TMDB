Her stepmother couldn't stand her and was always arguing with her father. He had little choice-he had to send Wenya to her mother's house, but her mother was fully focused on running her business and didn't have any time to take care of Wenya, so she was often shuttled off to her relatives' and friends' homes to be fostered. After so many years of a life of foster care, young Wenya felt lonely and helpless, and longed for the warmth of a home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g7R677brZRsWtl0PRDWBKy3gAVO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where is my home","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
