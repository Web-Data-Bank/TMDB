For this 1988 telecast, the Met assembled a cast capable of tackling both the musical and physical challenges of this bel canto farce, seen here in a whimsical production by John Cox. From the moment he takes the stage with Figaro’s iconic aria “Largo al factotum,” Leo Nucci combines winning charm with a robust baritone. Soprano Kathleen Battle tosses off one glittering vocal display after another as the feisty Rosina, while tenor Rowell Blake makes for an ardent Count Almaviva. Ralf Weikert conducts the lively performance, which also includes the comic duo of Enzo Dara as Dr. Bartolo and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Don Basilio.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rycNe9PIzdPccomEVGoUt89RE41.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Met - Il Barbiere di Siviglia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
