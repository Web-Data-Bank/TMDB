Until something went wrong: he ‘got lost’ and woke up in the body of an adult man. From this moment, the life of this Allard (48) gradually begins to change: he loses grip of his familiar world. The frog inside wants to go back home, to the marsh he knows so well. In this imaginative yet realistically shot film, the frog’s voice is heard on the voice-over.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sjyVpzVaMPSoF9iVvlRYrDRph9G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Room for Film","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":39626,"logo_path":null,"name":"N279 Entertainment","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mensendagen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
