The men, despite the efforts of their wives to stop them, spend all their time in the village’s bar, spending their last money on alcohol and sex. Chaos overcomes the village school; its devotees abandon the mosque. Only two youngsters benefit from all this mayhem, by realizing their love affair, forbidden by their parents. At the end, the women start upraising. Consequently, the bar is burnt down and the village looks that it will return to normality.","popularity":0.723,"poster_path":"/3NPh3BSzPeN8ssnhu32mS0wkQxD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87319,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manufaktura Productions","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Unforgettable Spring in a Forgotten Village","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
