The only thing known is his nickname — “The Atlas”. In a word, he is a riddle and riveting one at that, like an itch you cannot quite scratch. Theories and informed-and-fact-based-gossip flourish all around the place. As luck would have it, so does the conflict as what to do with him. The situation is close to exploding, but the Atlas won’t stir. Or will he?","popularity":0.852,"poster_path":"/b65qmSkIse1ja5bk6piVEZO2IFE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45475,"logo_path":null,"name":"Munk Studio","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2017-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Atlas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
