There would be three new teams: the Adelaide Crows, Fremantle and Port Adelaide. We farewelled Fitzroy and watched others like Footscray, Richmond, Melbourne and Hawthorn battle for their existence. For the first time non-Victorian clubs would take premiership honours. West Coast won twice and Adelaide won back-to-back flags against the odds.
