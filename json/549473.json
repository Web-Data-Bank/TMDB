It is to go back home.\" Why? Because when loneliness strips you naked you understand the importance of the relationships you build with people around you. “No turning back” is an introspective and epic film, delicate and powerful: there is not only vertical life, there is not only performance. There is an all-round discovery of what makes a life worth living.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3PdthHMKFiIM91NXjL7RO6JhEOB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hansjörg Auer: No Turning Back","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
