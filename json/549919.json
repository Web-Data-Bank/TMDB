Working the land and making textiles to sell, Zulay’s industrious family sent all of their daughters to school — at the time an unusual move in Quinchuqui — and raised an intelligent, independent daughter whose literacy, business sense and introduction to the Preloráns led her to try her luck in the States. Devoted to her village, she relates a mesmerizing account of Otavaleñan traditions and reflects on her experiences in the US.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zYHAdYq1OqrsXEaMbra7jlgTSWa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zulay, Facing the 21st Century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
