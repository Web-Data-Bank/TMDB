Red Banks, a pre-contact Ho-Chunk village site near present day Green Bay, WI was also the site of Jean Nicolet’s landing, who in 1634 was the first European what is today Wisconsin. Images and text are used to explore this space alongside my grandmother’s recollections. Each serve as representations of personal and shared memory, as well as representations of practices and processes of remembrance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3yOcD9XGbVn84KIuKKIyGYUXCPQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kunįkága Remembers Red Banks, Kunįkága Remembers the Welcome Song","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
