Amy is a poverty-stricken artist and tattooist in the midst of a downward spiral grappling with chronic isolation and meaninglessness in New York City. Cara is a wealthy, young backpacker with self-sabotaging tendencies who’s been traveling for a year, running from family pressures. They meet accidentally when Cara gets locked out the night before her flight and proceeds to accidentally break into the wrong apartment. Amy and Cara’s initial differences gradually subside over the course of the evening.  The story pivots around this brief exchange – a simple conversation from which both women emerge changed.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/hIT134Ompg7rGkzQ7sOWXKUZxYj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A talkative Australian traveller and a reclusive artist form an unlikely bond after an accidental 'break and enter' in Brooklyn.","title":"EUDAEMONIA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
