But she does keep a diary that contains some fact and many fictional entries. One such is read by the wife of her boss who promptly sues for a divorce. Virginia Grey stars in a musical produced by Hall and sings (possibly dubbed) \"Makin' a Million\" and \"Keep Your Chin Up.\" No spoiler to add that Ryan gets a boyfriend and Hall and Allbritton are reunited before this one runs it course.","popularity":0.877,"poster_path":"/6mGDVDWw8HGSpDzxh7iRwRuLMaW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men in Her Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
