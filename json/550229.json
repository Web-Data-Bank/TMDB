Mark Eccleston is an athlete who has overcome tremendous adversity - this frank, fearless and often funny film tells his triumph of the human spirit. He became one of the world's leading wheelchair tennis players and held the World No 1 spot for fourteen months. He went on to win a silver medal in the Athens Paralympics in 2004. Mark could never have achieved this level of success without the great will power he shows daily - and a philosophy which is as useful to the able bodied as to the disabled.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sldiakJDmItHxRtvn1XuK9drE9V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pushing the Limits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
