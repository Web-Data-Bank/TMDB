In October of 1998 Adam Green and Will Barratt threw together a short film called \"Columbus Day Weekend\" to screen at a Halloween party. Little did they know that it would give birth to an annual tradition that would span two decades and spawn a feature film and television production studio that would become a leader of the indie horror scene. FOR THE LOVE OF HALLOWEEN is a walk down memory lane with all of your favorite key players from the ArieScope family as they share the candid stories behind 20 years of Halloween shorts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kkpl4zkm37hKGPWINngCGzESQ3x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For the Love of Halloween","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
