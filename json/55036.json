Despite the high stakes, many of the firm's staff are eager to step into Tony's now-vacated shoes and get credit for saving the company. Daniel Pascoe, the leading trader at the firm, is convinced that he's first in line for the assignment, but the firm imports a new trader from America, Anna Schuman. Daniel is enraged and makes a point of trying to dig up as much dirt on Anna as he can, but things are going to take another turn.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/12wxNOf5hlya1tlStyPTlcosqgm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8363,"logo_path":"/2jrr5PsaURZK5WO2aCauc6cZHRr.png","name":"Euston Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":364,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Rank Organisation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dealers","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
