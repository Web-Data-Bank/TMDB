It also had a fulminating effect on Ernesto Baca, one of the pillars of experimental cinema in Argentina. Requiem for a forgotten film begins with that emotional blow, with the director in the first person, in a proposal that intercalates biographical elements (his life in Florencio Varela , the relationship with his mother, his teachers, the influence of Claudio Caldini, and ... until his own wake!) with others of (science) fiction, in which Baca himself appears as a scientist in his laboratory, activating devices with the goal of carrying out Proyecto argenta, the first virgin film of national industry that allows him - and also his group of friends of the Super 8 Club - to continue filming against the digital advance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8tp77r0N2nxJ7VUzhZvrFU6K486.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Réquiem para un Film Olvidado","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
