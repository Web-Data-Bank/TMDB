The question is only if that was the meaning or a tragic accident. Through Ronny's regret of what he has done and his struggle to defend himself from a long prison sentence, we will follow the Danish legal system from within in a completely unique and extraditable way. For the first time ever, cameras will follow a whole trial in Denmark.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2011-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Samurai case","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
