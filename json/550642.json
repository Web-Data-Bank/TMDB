I was fascinated with Jane. She was so interested in the world around her while Stan seemed caught up only in his ideas. She picked seed pods from trees and plants and told me she had written a lexicon of dog language. She was so much more complex than Stan's portrayal of her in Window Water Baby Moving (1958) that I decided to make a documentary about her for my graduate project.\" â€” Barbara Hammer  16mm film, Color/Sound","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iPc8gHBsFCuLfUf5PACKANZM8f5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jane Brakhage","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
