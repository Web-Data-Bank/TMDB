Yet they remain undaunted, demonstrating the South African proverb: \"When you have touched a woman, you have struck a rock.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8B4aBIA2LgQPQ3PaYtT2d0aXFxV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Have Struck a Rock!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
