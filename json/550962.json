Particularly if a person has experienced as much as the well-known dissident Lidija Lasmane-Doroņina. Actually, she does not even think of herself as a dissident. She received her three terms in prisons and labour camps – fourteen years in all – as punishment not for underground struggle but for daring to remain true to her principles, convictions and faith. The ideals Lidija obtained as a child – the idyllic image of Latvia as an independent country, strong family values and faith in God as a moral measuring stick for any action. Her eyes are bright even today, at the age of 91, and they look at this world full of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gLmaNXOdtGFxUdAMMItP18DM5AR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2017-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lidija","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
