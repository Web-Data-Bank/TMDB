But he wouldn’t wish this upon anybody. Having grown up in the remote Khumbu region of Nepal, Apa was forced to leave school and work as a porter at the age of 12. His dreams of being a doctor forever lost. It is a story all too common for the Sherpa people of Nepal, a story Apa aims to change with his work at the Apa Sherpa Foundation.  In this visually stunning short documentary, we follow young Pemba Sherpa, a young child who must walk six hours a day to attend school. Pemba’s story is a present day reflection of Apa’s past, one where the draw of being a high altitude porter conflicts with the dreams of Nepal’s rural people, dreams made possible only through education and knowledge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dNwBLK7FSTbdAI3kX7VxEISILic.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loved by All: The Story of Apa Sherpa","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
