They issued him ten visas in fifteen years. A long trail of papers, stamps, permits, and restrictions connected Darío to Germany while also keeping him at a distance. Then one fine day the mayor of Hamburg invites Darío to become a German citizen. A confession of love? Darío responds with a tender, ironic road movie that traces his intertwined journey from the country of his fathers to the country of his children.","popularity":1.135,"poster_path":"/bHCN6W9CGMZprG6MofbQEP3oRhx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Büchner Filmproduktion GbR","origin_country":""},{"id":118543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reck Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of My Children","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
