Monelle is a circular film without any narrative or hierarchy, without a beginning or an end, and it circumscribes a place of promiscuity and ambiguity between the different formats used—35mm and CGI animation—and the approaches of two opposites film attitudes—the structural cinema and the horror genre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nOO81u62QKYqEqCB4w7Hw0RRFd8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76361,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Between Art Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monelle","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
