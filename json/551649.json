In 1965 A. Tarkovsky visited Armenia, Geghardavank. It is hard to say what he has been looking for and what he has seen there. Fortunately has fixed (on occasion) several frames (6min., 35mm, b/w) from the visit of the greatest master in Geghardavank. Anyway, such frames provide an opportunity for connecting the past and the present by making new shootings and fulfilling the \"gaps\" which have been missed by the camera 45 years ago. What is the ideology? Indeed, what was Andrey Tarkovsky looking for at the church of the XIII century in such a rocky place? Probably, he was looking for God. ... because nothing else is significant in Geghardavank and around. Only the presence of God is felt in that place.","popularity":0.932,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andrey","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
