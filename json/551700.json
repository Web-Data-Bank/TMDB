We encounter a dentist and writer, a tired ex-boxer who had a carrier in Germany, a hardcore punk band Pas Maters, whose charismatic front man and lead singer mysteriously disappeared, an old soccer supporter with the last name Hajduk, an ex-hooligan diligently studying in a night school and many others. A complex portrait of an unusual Split neighbourhood and its even more unusual inhabitants with Hajduk as their religion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6WKEpBND8J6sZNMEetXnWF8eI4K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artizana Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hills Village 21000 Split","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
