Climate change, resource limits, economic downturn, social disconnection. Surely these issues can only be properly managed by our governments?  Living the Change explores solutions to the global crises we face today – solutions any one of us can be part of – through the inspiring stories of people pioneering change in their own lives and in their communities in order to live in a sustainable and regenerative way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A5eOYo4jMMMNDl03H6o9DfhuIqD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102831,"logo_path":"/wPSdOxHQCr3OD09Tbc2m0VMPPNg.png","name":"Happen Films","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living the Change: Inspiring Stories for a Sustainable Future","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":6}
