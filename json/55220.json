The movie follows their lives through Jesse's death at the hands of the \"rotten little coward\" Bob Ford and Frank's death in 1892.","popularity":2.752,"poster_path":"/en7FjRdtXhFXCmnf9rLh92NUuAI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84087,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joseph Cates Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James","video":false,"vote_average":5.278,"vote_count":9}
