The American director Frank Capra said of Chocolate and Soldiers \"We can't beat this kind of thing. We make a film like that maybe once in a decade. We haven't got the actors. It shows the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, presenting even enemy Chinese soldiers as brave individuals. It is considered to be a \"humanist\" film, paying close attention to the human feelings of both the soldier and his family. Cinema theorist Kate Taylor-Jones suggests that Chocolate and Soldiers provided \"a vision of the noble, obedient and honourable Japanese army fighting to defend the emperor and Japan.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":"/MPp9KEEmjbqHPYXMxWDCWpI4YV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1938-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chocolate and Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
