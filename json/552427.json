It asks the question of how a museum and a battlefield could be related. The question emerges when Steyerl follows the trace of an empty bullet casing which she found in the area where the mass grave of Andrea Wolf and her friends were located in Van, Turkey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6NsqwXv1so8D0yjxM4YRkryk4l9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Is the Museum a Battlefield?","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
