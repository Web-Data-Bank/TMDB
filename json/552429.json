Like entering a roomful of stories, the viewer steps into an unfamiliar space guided only by the sound of the radio tuning in to lifestyle programming, call-in shows and radio dramas. The portraits and settings layered atop the aural landscape create questions, provide humor, offer context and withdraw explanation of what once seemed clear before entering the room.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cXWk4GoZYDOx2R1pQuqJsdQwuR1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Ones","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
