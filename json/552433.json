While the shots gradually move closer to the object, the film turns slowly from figurative to abstract and makes apparent the synchronized movement and interdependence of the rotating camera and the light source that is illuminating the object. The depicted object is a reconstruction of a sundial that was used in the 17th century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exposure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
