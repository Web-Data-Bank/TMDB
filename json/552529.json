The last trip of the BAP was in 1979; in the nineties, its various branches were permanently abandoned. Since then, travelers have been inhabiting the railway landscape as they dream, desire, remember or yearn: as part of their own being and national history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o6W6vPuyC3HLJ8Z5r1JoJ77J6Lo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132799,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Zonda Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2019-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buenos Aires al Pacífico","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
