It follows the complicated relationship between director Lena Macdonald and her mother, who was once a filmmaker herself, but ended up homeless, crack-addicted and on the streets. For ten years Lena filmed in the cold, hard streets of Torontoâ€™s inner city and her story is raw, honest and unforgettable. Mom and Me is about addiction, prostitution and despair but it is also a story about family, the power of hope and the tenacity of love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109833,"logo_path":"/kZwx5KwbbOx6plPqGlos4ExPhxs.png","name":"90th Parallel","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":75168,"logo_path":"/7QhlWdkgNchV1XK194QTbFNGy6v.png","name":"TVO","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mom and Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
