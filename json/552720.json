Swinging cow udders, woman sweeping, farm woman walking, nuns chanting, Nude Descending, voices in a bread shop, Dachau and other artworks from Documenta 7, riding the escalator of the Centre Pompidou, etc. are layered in overlapping, shifting, and repetitive frame-clusters pulled from Super 8 footage filmed on a trip that began in Bucharest and ended in Paris. Disparate elements are combined and manipulated to construct a lyrical work about walking, history, and memory.\" - Holly Fisher","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zIb3FOrdoThyuulP1ZmKWIaJqpH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soft Shoe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
