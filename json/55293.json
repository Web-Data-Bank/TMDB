Imagine dreading the touch of another human but longing for a passionate encounter with a large public structure. This is the strange world of the \"objectum sexual\"– a group of people, mainly women, whose intimate lives revolve around objects with which they say they share romantic and sexual love. Erika is married to the Eiffel Tower. She has a passion for inanimate objects, and her mission is to fight the stigma surrounding the disorder and create a global network of sufferers - like Amy, in love with a church organ, and Eija Riita, who married the Berlin Wall.","popularity":0.743,"poster_path":"/xISPO3G0zkpkHAg4zyoynxqle57.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Imagine a world in which people are hostile and objects affectionate and loving","title":"Married to the Eiffel Tower","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":10}
