There is only a small problem with the paperwork – her file is not on the computer. A temporary loss of data seems to be caused by a software glitch, nothing to worry about. Within a few days, Ana is entangled in a web of bureaucracy of Kafkaesque proportions: not being in the computer means no social security, no permanent address and no baby. She is brutally forced to leave a newborn girl alone at the hospital without any right to visit her until everything is sorted out. All of a sudden Ana is a foreigner, even though she has lived in Slovenia all of her life. Legally, she doesn’t exist. So, her child is an orphan. And orphans are put up for adoption.","popularity":1.16,"poster_path":"/5OicE54QjTv0UDxpymnCEyK3gtE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Delirium","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":54089,"logo_path":"/gAuDLJVyiDjkEMkMrGmfdYaw6OE.png","name":"Gustav Film","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":20916,"logo_path":"/kTzjchV1BXm1kSmR5vPRUnJfLil.png","name":"Kinorama","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2018-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erased","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
