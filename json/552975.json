Gorgeous Kiri Te Kanawa is the Marschallin, the gracious noblewoman who understands that her affair with a younger man cannot last. Tatiana Troyanos is every bit the passionate seventeen year old Octavian who swears he will never love another woman—until he meets the bewitching Sophie (Judith Blegen) when he presents her with a silver rose on behalf of the loutish Baron Ochs (Kurt Moll). James Levine’s inspired leading of the Met orchestra and the enthralling production by Nathaniel Merrill and Robert O’Hearn combine to bring Old Vienna, with its timeless elegance, to life once again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a9c9eXMoUcws1uPuTeEJ5NjuZrb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Rosenkavalier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
