It does so in a style teenagers can relate to. Their busts augmented by water balloons, Siler's nymphet heroines head out through their mushrooming slice of suburbia to try their luck with a couple of conveniently available teenage boys. The results satisfy their childish curiosity, but perhaps there is something more promising waiting for them when one sleeps over later....Tasteful and up-beat, First Base is appropriate viewing for all ages.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A little girl tries her first kiss with a boy, but finds it better with another girl.","title":"First Base","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
