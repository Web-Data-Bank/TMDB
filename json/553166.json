Matsuzaki (Eiji Okuda) is a racing tipster for a sports paper, a lowlife who spends half his time drunk, hangs out with yakuza and other riff-raff and complicates his sex life by succumbing to advances from his girlfriend's sister. As played by Okuda, he's also a figure of considerable hangdog charm. Less a plot-based movie than a guide to the several forms of high stakes gambling in Japan, this centres on his attempt to help a friend swindled in a bent mahjong game.  Hakuryu appears (memorably) as an inscrutable yakuza in a black leather jacket. The film's success led to two sequels.","popularity":0.962,"poster_path":"/fy1HTtivXLFULXTomSuIFAHsAjt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":880,"logo_path":"/vwhPRAZ4lhUtSuaifk4Au2MIm92.png","name":"Daiei Film","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wicked Reporter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
