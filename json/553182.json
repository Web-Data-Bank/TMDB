Fields of color fragment into pixels or smear into mutating organisms. Swarming text grids explode into chaotic rainbow clouds, blinking dots, stars, and spirals. Snaking orange lines and pointillist textures form strobing mandalas, mosaic embroidery, and Pac Man architecture, tumbling geometries of throbbing color that dissolve into blue, pink, yellow, and green pixel noise.\"  - Leo Goldsmith, writing about VanDerBeek's Poemfield series","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iiPZAaVBGNyfkqifMV6nrOzvcLd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poem Field No. 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
