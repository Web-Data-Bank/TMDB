He achieved his greatest fame as Moebius - not so much a pseudonym as an alter ego. With his triple-split personality - Jean Giraud, Moebius, Gir - he succeeded in making his work accessible in popular comic strip series like Blueberry, in metaphysical fantasies like John Difool and, not least, to a broad public, with set designs for films such as The Fifth Element. In Moebius Redux - A Life in Pictures an exceptional artist tells his life's and work's story. Extraordinary views on Paris, Los Angeles and the Mexican desert build a visual link between his life and his artistic universe, accompanied by the electronic soundtrack composed by \"Kraftwerk\" legend Karl Bartos.","popularity":1.593,"poster_path":"/gnVtpbTsT7LScTuVPyP22HDhjP9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":33137,"logo_path":null,"name":"Morag Loves Company","origin_country":""},{"id":17255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avanti Media Plus","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moebius Redux: A Life in Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8}
