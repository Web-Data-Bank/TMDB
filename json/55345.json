Shot entirely in HD, The Storming follows a stacked roster of riders around the globe while tallying up footy of choking powder, techy pillow drops, and mind-numbingly gargantuan airs. From the sled-accessed Tahoe backcountry to the sphincter-clenching peaks of Iceland, The Storming grabs you by the gnads and leaves you whimpering in the corner with that tingly \"ready to shred\" feeling in the pit of your stomach.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/f0Wnw7ua4ilewN5cCq56QSJdYUs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Storming","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
