An ambivalent character, both regal in bearing and warmly protective, cruel and yet loving, rapacious and indomitable even in the face of madness, this ’Machiavelli among miscreants’ destined to become chief of police, uses his conquests to advance relentlessly in the pursuit of his aims whilst keeping his hand closely hidden. Guy Cassiers, working for the first time with the Paris Opera, portrays a three-tiered society where some rise and others fall.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/93HmhQoknL2Zezob9En31IHktsG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"World premiere of Luca Francesconi's creation live at the Palais Garnier, Paris on March 13, 2017","title":"Francesconi: Trompe-la-Mort","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
