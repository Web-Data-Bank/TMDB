A repertoire classic, Willy Decker’s streamlined production makes the Paris Opera echo once more to the strains of Russian romantic music. Edward Gardner conducts an exceptional cast including Peter Mattei in the title role and Anna Netrebko as Tatiana.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eflMLaOuAQLbSPWSjFllu10ZVkR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's opera live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on May 16th, 2017","title":"Tchaikovsky: Eugene Onegin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
