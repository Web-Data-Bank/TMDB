Adapting Pushkin's epic poem, Mussorgsky composed a meditation on the solitude of power, a populist drama in which the real protagonist is the Russian people with its burden of eternal suffering. Ivo Van Hove is no stranger to grand political frescos. This is his first production for the Paris Opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a9hJ3s5cZutiF5C0UVfkUFsMruT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Modest Mussorgsky's masterpiece live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on June 7th, 2018","title":"Mussorgsky: Boris Godunov","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
