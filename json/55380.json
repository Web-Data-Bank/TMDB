Amongst those listening is Air Marshal Hardie who is due to fly to Tokyo the next day. Hardie initially dismisses the dream because he is scheduled to fly out in a Liberator, but as Hardie arrives at the airport he discovers that the Liberator has developed mechanical problems and has been replaced by a Dakota. When, just before the flight is due to depart, two soldiers board the plane making a complement of eight, Hardie fears that the dream may be coming true and he is destined to die.","popularity":1.822,"poster_path":"/xrIpXLmAHULKFSV3NB4SiNQ6DAW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2650,"logo_path":"/sDWe94w5fuyfgfRKc3N27CSJvsD.png","name":"Ealing Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1955-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"12 Men and a Girl Re-Living a Dream That Fortold Disaster","title":"The Night My Number Came Up","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":27}
