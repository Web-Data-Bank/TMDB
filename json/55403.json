The film covers the years from 1949 to 1965 (Helismaa's death). Since the film is based on real-life persons it also tells much about the change in Finland during those years and of course much about Finnish popular music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iZqCuIEWpFZKJrR38XK63j9cZze.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artista Filmi Oy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1999-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Swan and the Wanderer","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
