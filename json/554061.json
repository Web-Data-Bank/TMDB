Imagining a fractured continent in the thrall of self-learning data sites that trigger world events, the film confronts various forms of hoax, from cut and paste political doctrines to neo-classical facade architectures. Mapping ideological and political currents that are presently unraveling the European Union, Eurasia describes fake news as a man-made proxy of the indifference that an artificial intelligence may feel toward the human condition. Through modes of science fiction, documentary, and folk tale, Eurasia creates an immersion within layers of media production, wrapping facts in fictions, and fictions in facts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":139173,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institute of Contemporary Arts (London)","origin_country":""},{"id":119456,"logo_path":"/h5HZMAao2R3a3lApiF9MIl2SHT.png","name":"Red Pepper Film","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":139174,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sektor Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
