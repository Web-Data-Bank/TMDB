To give you the good oil, the movie follows the simplistic travels of two surfers, meeting friends along the way, on an open ended journey across an archipelago littered with islands and breaks. Connected by ribbons of tarmac and separated by deep ocean valleys these islands have been here for millennia and will continue to do so for millennia to come. An veritable eden for waves of every nature, from long reeling glassy points breaks to sketchy urchin infested waves in the middle of nowhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/huU9fRFcT6yLq1BIzYs8rp0EHLR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
