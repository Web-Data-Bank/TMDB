Would you believe a lone mother who is unfit to pay her mortgage and also raise her rebellious teenage daughter? Indeed, no one believes that the troubled ex-detective has discovered a serial murder case. Personal dramas and a murder mystery unfold in present-day Budapest, where demonstrations are part of the pre-election life of a city still trying to cope with the shadows of its historical and recent past. It is a city where nothing seems honest and true, except through the eyes of an emotionally unstable policewoman and her misfit daughter who wants to know who her father truly was.","popularity":3.082,"poster_path":"/ckkzYZWzFuEn9cS6KQ1eypQaSnI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Focus-Fox Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2018-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"X - The eXploited","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":28}
