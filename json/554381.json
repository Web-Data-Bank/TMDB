The South Korean hibakusha were detained by South Korean authorities for the duration of the prime minister’s visit. This film follows the lives of these eight people. That same year, Son Chin-tu, a hibakusha who had entered Japan illegally and was being held at the Omura Detention Center, filed his so-called “Hibakusha Certificate Lawsuit,” demanding Japanese residency and medical treatment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To the Japs: South Korean A-Bomb Survivors Speak Out 倭奴（イエノム）へ　在韓被爆者・無告の二十六年","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
