But every end is a new beginning. After 1991 rose a new, second generation of punks who still believe that another world is possible and necessary. Active members of the underground: musicians, activists, squatters, music promoters and organizers tell us about punk ideology, culture, music, squatting movement, lust for freedom and political struggle under the flag of anarchism. Firsthand, forthright. This is a document of independence, love for music and creativity. Reflection on the work of passion and of the world, not driven by capital. From the punks for the punks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vGzX2DlLm79zEPSHN5VbPKzUi47.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famul Stuart, School of Applied Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":110268,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visoka Šola za Umetnost","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2016-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rejects of the Second Generation – Following the Traces of Punk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
