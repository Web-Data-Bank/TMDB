After doing time in hard-core Sing-Sing for petty thefts and drug dealing, Piñero's prison experiences developed into the 1974 Tony-nominated play Short Eyes. The resulting notoriety and fame was too much for the Latino bad-boy genius who retreated to the darker corners of New York City.","popularity":2.75,"poster_path":"/rn1jbfASOd9cndsUr5Tt25jHsVZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burnside Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lower East Side Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2150,"logo_path":null,"name":"GreeneStreet Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piñero","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":9}
