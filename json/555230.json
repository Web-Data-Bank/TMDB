Die Zauberflöte is heard more often and has been more frequently performed, discussed, queried and interrogated than almost any other work in the history of opera. It is rare for the mysteriousness and multiformity of a work to be adjured with such mantric intensity. It is equally rare for a work to enjoy such undisputed success despite all these debates – and for over two hundred years at that.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/zV2diN7IWbzU3yBvT7tW8JcgWDe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salzburger Festspiele","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":102793,"logo_path":"/kNELUhi9Tnyw8Od01236QYErqHF.png","name":"ARTE Concert","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2019-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A fairytale for unstable times","title":"Mozart: Die Zauberflöte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
