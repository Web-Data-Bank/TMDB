Nell’s last stop on a nationwide book tour takes her to the town of Springdale, the hometown of Emmett Turner, a young man she met over five years ago while both were junior copy editors at a New York publishing company. Nell was hurt when Emmett stood her up for a dinner date and then disappeared from New York without any explanation. As Nell is quick to admit, Emmett’s colorful, nostalgic anecdotes about Springdale inspired her to write this book that is shaping her life and especially this holiday season.","popularity":4.143,"poster_path":"/1ofOSade5htAKST44j1q8oXqOFv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hometown Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":5225,"logo_path":"/9oijQKTGkZgKsaohP3WGnjxjNt8.png","name":"Johnson Production Group","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Town Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":6.561,"vote_count":49}
