Alone in the heart of the polar winter battling with the Arctic ice pack and its ruthless laws, Michael turns to the techniques, know-how and reflexes of the Inuits who have thrived in the Arctic for thousands of years. A story of the human journey, Call of the Ice is a film about learning, with its failures and pain, but also victories in the face of adversity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call of the Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
