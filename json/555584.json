In times of personal independence and immense opportunities relationships have become non-relationships. The nature of being human thus becomes a complex navigation through dangerous waters where everyone feeds on their neighbor and the possibility of love is blocked by a constant emotional distortion, yet there are no boundaries; the field opens up a plethora of crossroads. The individual loses sense of direction and amidst confusion there is the future, as distant as it seems, ever present, irreversible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rrxNai92uNr5CnZ7CoEcdCvQWek.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Topanga Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2008-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reflexions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
