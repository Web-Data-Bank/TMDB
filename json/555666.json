He was a completely ordinary Latvian blue-collar worker. In order to be able to support his family under wartime conditions, he worked at the German military aviation warehouses and supplemented his income by smuggling at night. This film attempts to answer the question whether Žanis’ courage stems from his adventurous and daring spirit, stubbornness, or a sense of responsibility towards people in need.","popularity":1.396,"poster_path":"/d7lTf2eZoEGHC6PuFUpBi74jz5g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79143,"logo_path":"/qIa22fhd6RWz6zTDCgVAN6U0u7J.png","name":"Mistrus Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2018-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To save a life means to save the world","title":"The Mover","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":8}
