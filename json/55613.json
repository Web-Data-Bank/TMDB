This atmosphere lends itself to repressed emotions - shown through the parallel stories of butler student Johann lusting after his mother (an old flame of the mysterious Count Knotkers) and Klara's attraction to her father (who lusts after his other daughter), leading to duels and suicidal plunges galore. All this is shot in the style of an early German sound film, complete with intertitles, deliberately crackly soundtrack and 'hand-tinted' colour effects.","popularity":2.027,"poster_path":"/eem91pLaN3kbiwYblbFrlJQbiXB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6697,"logo_path":null,"name":"the Canadian Council","origin_country":""},{"id":6698,"logo_path":null,"name":"CIDO","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":6700,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Manitoba Arts Council","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Careful","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":21}
