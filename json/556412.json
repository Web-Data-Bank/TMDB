Images of the labyrinth of abandoned corridors, interrogation rooms, and open and closed doors are accompanied by a soundtrack of the clanging, buzzing, and clicking sounds that would have been emitted by surveillance equipment when police occupied the building. Stasi City is an imprint of the haunting memories embedded in architecture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/825F4d55q5Kcmu9CGuTkumTbYlK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stasi City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
