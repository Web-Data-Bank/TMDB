Her husband cheated, her company went bust and without either, any sense of herself and the life she had was gone. Leaving everything behind she goes on the road and develops insomnia, her life turning into a waking dream. Endless driving, seedy motels, and chance encounters become the norm as one day blurs into the next. When she meets Terry, something changes. He's sweet and the sex has a tenderness she's never encountered with a one-night stand. Ultimately, she finds out he's a drug dealer, and agrees to run an errand for him. Arriving at her destination she immediately realizes it's a meth lab, and after spending the night with cooks Phil and Faith, wakes to find herself stranded. When she doesn't return that morning, Terry and his business partner January race to find her, and although January thinks Piper is better off dead, Terry gives her a handful of cash and just maybe a way to stop running from herself.","popularity":1.16,"poster_path":"/sqFrYHrM2mt44ZsLfpFJjWwWU9i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insomnia","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
