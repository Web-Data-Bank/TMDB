Olga built a farm inside the reactor. Sergey hides in the station labyrinths from reality, and Vitaly, who for many years supervised the construction of nuclear power plants, settled near on a home-made ship. The Crimean nuclear power plant does not let go of those who built it, or those who lived nearby. It was the most expensive project of the Soviet Union, but the nuclear power plant did not work for a single day. The empire collapsed, the annexation of the Crimea changed the fate of Russia. But which way? People live here, as if in a different dimension, hoping for something and waiting for something.
