They're rescued from the wreckage by Freddy, an oil worker whose stoic facade crumbles as he comes to see himself, and his repressed desires, in Maya. As Jules recovers, Maya and Freddy develop a rapport that dulls the debilitating silence of their small-town lives. Together, they subtly encourage one another to chase after what they want the most (or at least figure out what that might be).","popularity":1.735,"poster_path":"/4vdISEDiCMmcszMTQSnYzjASujT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artless Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":139975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Songbook Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":43560,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hungry Bear","origin_country":"US"},{"id":139976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terraform","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tragedy is where it starts, not where it ends...","title":"Jules of Light and Dark","video":false,"vote_average":3.1,"vote_count":8}
