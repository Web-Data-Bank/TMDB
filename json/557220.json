The duke's father objects to the union, whereupon Poisson arranges another marriage for his daughter, this time to an impoverished and sickly young marquis. Poisson's strategy runs something like this: the Marquis is expected to die soon, whereupon the widowed Lucie will become a marquess, and thus a worthy bride for the Duke. But the Marquis foils these plans by staging a miraculous recovery. The explanation? The Marquis and Lucie have been in love all along, and this was the only way that they could wed with Poisson's blessing. Darned clever, these Frenchmen!.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xNp0cosF8xHdAT4L1P5S7rtAPNW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Studios Paramount","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1932-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Will Be a Duchess","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
