Arthur hopes to find blueprints and maps drawn up by Tihonovetsky on how to make his way into space, floating down the river. In the place of the former manor there is an abandoned house of culture and a monument to the muscular proletarian pointing to the sky. Arthur finds the oldest man in the village, capable of at least something to tell. From him, he learns a story about a treasure, which has long been shared.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/VJ3khtQp0bvDQ3xXnkTUN19est.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"}],"release_date":"2018-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Nice Good Brass Band","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
