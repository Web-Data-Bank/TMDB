That is until she starts exhibiting strange symptoms and realizes she's caught a virus that's slowly turning her into a zombie. Desperate to find a cure, the only person she trusts is a loner at school, Flynn, a self-proclaimed expert in all things paranormal. But Tia's life gets even worse when a friend of her boyfriend, Connor, is murdered. Tia knows that Connor's friend Jason is involved but going to the cops makes her a target and with the clock ticking until Tia's too far gone to recover, she enlists the help of her mother Kate and a reclusive doctor in hopes they'll stop the disease before Jason finds out she's the snitch.","popularity":2.649,"poster_path":"/n8gzsWPSlH0hHaaFiZmX049bHtT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zombie at 17","video":false,"vote_average":5.786,"vote_count":7}
