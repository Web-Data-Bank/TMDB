It follows the transformation of an intimate place in the outskirts of Paris, home to immigrants and myths, into a prestigious real estate project. The journey of the building is mirrored in a hurtful switch from 16mm footage to a computer simulation. While mastering the risk to get lost in the jungle of voices passing the troubled spot that is a Parisian banlieue today, Daniel Nehm captures an “image juste” of contemporary transformation via the act of cleansing, ignoring and the destruction of dreams.
