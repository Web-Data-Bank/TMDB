This question is now getting serious attention from scientists who study animal senses. Humans rely on smell, sight, taste, touch and sound; other animals have super-powered versions of these senses, and a few have extra senses we don't have at all. From a dog that seems to use smell to tell time to a dolphin that can \"see\" with its ears, discover how animals use their senses in ways we humans can barely imagine. But it's not just the senses that are remarkable -- it's the brains that process them. NOVA goes into the minds of animals to \"see\" the world in an entirely new way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lvVYAMpScBQeseTVi6THyup5JqX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Animal Minds","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
