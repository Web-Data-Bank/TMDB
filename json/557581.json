Their parents are poor and illiterate. It is difficult for them to scrape together the money to send their daughters to school in another village. The money for tuition, books, and room and board away from home is often more than parents can spare.We follow several as they make the weekly three-hour trek to the local school. Among the teachers there is only one female who is an inspiration to them all. She encourages them in their studies and challenges them to progress. But we also witness the pain of one family who simply cannot pay for their daughter's schooling. She must drop out and put off her dreams for a while. The son who is less talented is favored for schooling.Beautifully photographed in the lush mountain greenery, these fresh faced girls hold onto their hopes of becoming teachers and doctors against great odds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sparrow Village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
