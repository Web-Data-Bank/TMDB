The traditional, low-set building is dilapidated, and the garden neglected. Inside, the view is obscured by the plastic sheets wrapped like semi-transparent veils around the furniture. From the house, Radulović looks in all four directions of her mental compass. To the east lies Bosnia, still licking its wounds from the Balkan war. The west represents NATO. To the north lies a new consumerist society and to the south, all the memories of former Yugoslavia. In a poetic cadence, Radulović uses images and words to explore what it means to be rootless despite having a home. She's caught between a past marked by war and a future that holds little promise of prosperity. The house that was once her safe haven is now at the mercy of international developments and political changes.","popularity":1.348,"poster_path":"/mq8N5u3ii80Z5n7zU56zijj5iwT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82861,"logo_path":null,"name":"Code Blue Production","origin_country":"ME"},{"id":109711,"logo_path":"/pnVK1uutyw6gOZt2tzKhEuFNQyj.png","name":"Nameless Productions","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"ME","name":"Montenegro"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Separation, Vivid Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
