When I was a child, I would regularly force my poor mother and her friends to watch the opening number of The Lion King, then demand it to be rewound so we could watch it again. I made this film in a contemplative mood, with certain ideas flowing in my head and a certain nostalgia guarding me from the uncertainty of the future. As I was assembling it, I realized these ideas of analog and digital, impermanence, and the images that helped form me were not quite enough. I couldn't run away from the defining event of my life. This is for my father, overcome by life too young. Though the more I watch, I realize it is also for my mother, who has cared so deeply and profoundly for us in his wake.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1Tp4rPimSF2gWcDrwOYGQrT3hY5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Immemorial","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
