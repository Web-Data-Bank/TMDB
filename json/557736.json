After the successes of \"Giulio Cesare\" in 1723 and \"Tamerlano\" in 1724, Rodelinda completes the trilogy of Handel’s great opera seria masterpieces. The work was composed in 1725 using Nicola Francesco Haym’s libretto, a work inspired by Antonio Salvi’s earlier libretto which had been itself adapted from Pierre Corneille’s tragedy \"Pertharite, roi des Lombards\". Rodelinda thus brought one of the most glorious compositional periods in the Handel’s career to a close, about a decade after his arrival in the British capital. Mixing romantic storytelling and political intrigue, Handel produced one of his most beautiful scores, a true operatic tour de force.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Hbk9IBywbMYN9l23ymucspQoN2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Real de Madrid","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":132434,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medici Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":184,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rodelinda","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
