Maria Bamford, as even casual fans will admit, is not \"most people.\" There's no telling what her Plan A might have entailed (perhaps a one-woman rendition of \"Grey Gardens?\"), but Bamford's Plan B turns out to be a virtuoso, one-woman performance of a self-imposed stint in Northwoods exile. Filmed live at the Varsity Theater in Minneapolis, the extra-packed DVD now out from Stand Up! Records has an intimate and theatrical flavor that may feel unexpected to some of Bamford's followers, but skillfully weaves together the most well-wrought portions of her repertoire. More focused than her usual stand-up routine, in Plan B Bamford takes on the story of her own Hollywood life, viewed from the much safer - and possibly much weirder - climes of Duluth, MN.","popularity":1.013,"poster_path":"/3CER74aB2ZQwQvEPNK2LoOeIC2x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria Bamford: Plan B","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
