Composed in 1780, two years before The Abduction from the Seraglio, Zaide contains melodies of incredible inventiveness. The opera lacks an overture, a finale and many spoken dialogues, yet the missing elements allowed Sellars to elaborate and transform the work into a grand manifesto against slavery. Sellars' vision provoked a scandal, as it had previously in Vienna and London, but the Cour de l'Archevêché has experienced plenty of scandals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zH2E7a0dwzL4dKv08csyCN4L6Z2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zaide","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
