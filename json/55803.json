They discover cash and self esteem when they set up an illegal bookie joint in their kitchen. Suddenly they can pay their bills; they imagine joining the middle class; they even make corporate donations to charity. The film also explores their relationships with men, most of whom are unfit for anything lasting, and with their mothers, who appear in surreal, imagined conversations with their daughters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hR8Zk85Y6IapEHlE4YNzfJPwTKu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Homegrown","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dogs: The Rise and Fall of an All-Girl Bookie Joint","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
