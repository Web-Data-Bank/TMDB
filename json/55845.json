In this biographical documentary, veteran director Kenneth Bowser shows how Phil's music and his fascinating life story and eventual decline into depression and suicide were intertwined with the history-making events that defined a generation. Even as his contemporaries moved into folk-rock and pop music, Phil followed his own vision, challenging himself and his listeners. Not one to pull punches, Ochs never achieved the commercial success he desperately desired. But his music remains relevant, reaching new audiences in a generation that finds his themes all too familiar.","popularity":1.655,"poster_path":"/2Y15JDYEvvhmnEJb7i1KzFJreEU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90755,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barking Dog Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":72952,"logo_path":null,"name":"S2BN Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phil Ochs: There But for Fortune","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
