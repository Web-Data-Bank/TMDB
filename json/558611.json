The project is based on two coordinates. It is based on the character of Hari in Andrej Tarkovsky's film Solaris, who is now the central figure (after Nana from Jean-Luc Godard's Vivre sa Vie in X NaNa / Subroutine, and Giuliana from Il Deserto Rosso in X Love Scenes); at the same time Crash Site / My_Never_Ending_Burial_Plot represents an attempt to close the cycle of X Characters by putting a symbolic end to the lives (more accurately, the afterlife) of the film characters concerned. Whether or not this attempt is successful remains, for the time being, an open question.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My_Never_Ending_Burial_Plot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
