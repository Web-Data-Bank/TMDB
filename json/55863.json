Williams, also a master of imitation and disguise, is asked to impersonate the Colonel, ostensibly to allow the Colonel to make a secret trip East. What Williams is not told is that the Colonel has recently been a target of assassins. After the Colonel's plane goes down, the plan changes and Williams maintains the disguise to confuse the Nazis about D-Day.","popularity":3.136,"poster_path":"/vGrgeTaPAXsNqFJ4bBIH5oD09Bd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dena Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1961-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You'll double up laughing when you see Mr. Fun On The Run!","title":"On the Double","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":13}
