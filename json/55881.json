Unsurprisingly, crime has grown alongside technology, and thus the GOTT, Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs, is formed as a sort of universal police force. Within this organization, there is a special (and secret) branch known as the ES Force (ES standing for \"Encounter of Shadow-work\"), consisting of twelve young people that possess amazing superpowers. Each ES member operates with another as a team, and the series' focus is a team of two low-level members, Éclair and Lumière. As the series progresses, they start to see the darker side of GOTT and its secrets.","popularity":1.624,"poster_path":"/j9hAb8nK8FD2sTXqtX4xs9TyPSB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1077,"logo_path":"/1tpNgC6BptieT9oF2LJ7H6pbG6S.png","name":"GONZO","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiddy Grade III: Truth Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
