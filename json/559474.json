Sephora Woldu plays \"Sephora\" who, like the director, is an architecture student but also a filmmaker. She is pitching to her traditional mother a film she wants to make about a man who fled their home country and ended up in San Francisco. As a recently arrived immigrant, he is terribly homesick for his native Eritrea, but will not admit it due to unease towards speaking ill of the country; and more consciously in hesitance of admitting hard truths about his culture and himself. \"Itâ€™s colorful and visually whimsical in a way that can only be described as if the Wizard of Oz went to Africa,\" said Woldu.","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":"/tfmNpQWl1IAaNnjrEmhktPzs8cu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An experimental musical movie about Eritrea","title":"Life is Fare","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
