When the children are visited by a wolf, pretending to be their Po Po, or granny, they let him in the house, but ultimately are not fooled by his deep voice and hairy face. Combining ancient Chinese panel art techniques with a contemporary palette of watercolors and pastels, this powerful story brings lessons about strangers, trust and courage to a new generation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jrmrhudXIoSAF5kdXZzMDi4Dlh1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1938,"logo_path":"/Tmc9JLmLPTSQUgsMP4BjCN8Off.png","name":"Scholastic Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lon Po Po: A Red-Riding Hood Story from China","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
