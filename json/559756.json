One of the most fascinating personalities of his time: Mustafa Kemal Ataturk - Monuments to the father of modern Turkey can be found in every city, the anniversary of his death is commemorated every year, derogatory words about him are punishable by law. Rarely has a politician changed a society so radically in such a short time as Ataturk did in Turkey, which was born out of the declining Ottoman Empire. He acted with unconditional determination when it came to catapulting a deeply backward country into modernity. His reforms still have an impact today.","popularity":0.72,"poster_path":"/fTqveIPtpXuqjGRkuxzMYlmh3C9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":87343,"logo_path":null,"name":"ORF Universum","origin_country":""},{"id":108936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Loopfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":75803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Interspot Film","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":66385,"logo_path":null,"name":"ORF Enterprise","origin_country":""},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2018-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atatürk: The Father of Modern Turkey","video":false,"vote_average":7.75,"vote_count":4}
