The latter led to a panic in Hong Kong, before the Handover of the former UK colony to Mainland China, and a number of motion pictures proceeded to take freedom of speech (and sometimes political symbolism) to the extreme. This is the story of one of the most curious and invigorating periods in exploitation filmmaking.","popularity":4.333,"poster_path":"/sk6f3Ux8IP3b5u52EzzZ5g55yAd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19078,"logo_path":null,"name":"High Rising Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Category III: The Untold Story of Hong Kong Exploitation Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8}
