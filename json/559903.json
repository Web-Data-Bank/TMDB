In 2012 at the Puccini Plus Festival, the Opéra de Lyon presented Puccini’s Il trittico over the course of several evenings.  The plot is set in an Italian convent at the end of the 17th century. In a conversation among the sisters, they confide their final wishes to each other. After telling her own wish, Sister Angelica is falsely accused of dreaming of becoming rich. Damned, her life takes a tragic turn that leads to her death. This brilliant Suor Angelica stars Csilla Boross and Natascha Petrinsky framed by David Pountney’s cold and heavenly staging that recalls the white marble of 17th century convents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zZMnpGH5MrGDx4b1KlLKuHHPRiB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il trittico - Suor Angelica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
