Like the concepts of Oscar Wilde’s portrait story of Dorian Gray, where beauty and sensual fullfilment are the only worthy pursuits of the protagonist, the film’s aesthetics are composed and imbued by painting. The references and events of Melodica are sourced from the painting The Golden Age by Lucas Cranach the Elder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5AhPiQmBHAgGm24A35dR2PD40NZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Catinca Tabacaru Gallery","origin_country":""},{"id":11703,"logo_path":null,"name":"KASK","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melodica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
