Sylvia undergoes a horrifying physical transformation, and she finds herself drawn into a persecuted underworld where she begins an astonishing journey of freakish self-discovery. Marker is a classic coming-of-age tale with a horror twist, which pits its heroine against her oppressors - the town's non-afflicted - in a battle for self-determination--and survival.","popularity":0.711,"poster_path":"/5fJOyKIrBKTzMcw0LnBNO1fJoNY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't let it get out","title":"Marker","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
