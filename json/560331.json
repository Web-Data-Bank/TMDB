Film’s overly protracted opening has car’s drivers (Filipe Cochofel, Antonio Pedro Figueiredo) joy riding the night away until the roadster breaks down. Momentum picks up at sunrise with their attempts to fix the car.  A retired mechanic-turned-beekeeper with a heart condition (Canto e Castro) does the trick and convinces Figueiredo to take him cross-country on a motorbike to look up an old friend.  Cochofel and the mechanic’s alarmed niece (Maysa Marta) follow in pursuit. The old man dies peacefully on the road, but Figueiredo, having wholeheartedly grasped his deliverance mission, keeps going.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/cQOAi6qPMSRn4xu0i1NRPqR6vc8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Far Away from Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
