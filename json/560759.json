Through his memories, the film presents a story that embraces two generations and various eras. It is a film about the tragedy of lives dragged into conflicts against their will, of lives violently ruined or ended – a story about the devastating consequences of war. Interweaving past and present, the flashback narrative depicts the war as a perpetual situation where the „little people” always turn out to be on the losing side.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/byPiK1NZzwW9Fhl6lek8F2a3Mzb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul Cinematografic București","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1960-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Doesn't Spare","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
