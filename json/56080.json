Formed in the Bronx with the intent of infusing Dominican bachata with the sounds of contemporary American R&B, Aventura released their first album in 1999, and built their following steadily but surely over subsequent releases. This 2007 two-disc live release, which finds the group playing to a sold-out crowd, is an enjoyable sampler of their smooth, tropical flavor (Aventura fall more on the traditional side than the hybrid or R&B side) and charismatic performances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fN0xL5XUqJs49TzHm7LjrR9sPKI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aventura: Kings of Bachata: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden","video":true,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
