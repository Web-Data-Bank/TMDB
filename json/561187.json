They want human dignity and justice restored to them.  The individual testimonies in Silence Broken, combined with unusual archival footage and dramatized images, shatter the half-century of silence and create a collective story filled with soulful sorrow and amazing resilience of the human spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3ai9ZytjcCucxQWQCBzL9rK2nOj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Center for Asian American Media Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silence Broken: Korean Comfort Women","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
