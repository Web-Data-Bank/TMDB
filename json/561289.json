She is looking for a place to stay – with running water and a warm bed. Her husband is in prison. When he gets out, they have big plans: to find a place to stay, to get a job, to stop using, to start a new life. Will they make it? Through their story, the film talks about universal human desires: to be loved and to belong – someplace, with someone. But first we have to love ourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/koSn2AYyFvwiX26dpyBtG4PZEJG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37020,"logo_path":"/o6XZOvru5b5yuDQ6tc7vP69MBwi.png","name":"Sever \u0026 Sever","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2018-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Much Do You Love Yourself?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
