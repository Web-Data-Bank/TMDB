If the problem of socialism was time loss—too much bureaucracy, too much conversation, too many meetings—a socialism-on-speed, counting electricity plus statistics, could move past this limit. The film recounts the history of a moment in time when, against all odds, it seemed feasible to plan for the whole system at once—collective ownership of global resources with the programmed and networked efficiency of Wal-Mart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ivmSeeHNU3Ll4jB54bp1auti8gd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Scarcity","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
