Our heroine's adventures begin when she catches the eye of a big-city playboy named Arthur (Michel Auclair), who is attracted not only to Zoe's beauty, but by her insistence upon telling nothing but the whole truth. This trait causes no end of comic complications when Zoe moves into the palatial home of Arthur's family. The limit comes when Zoe botches a big business deal formulated by Arthur's not-altogether-honest father (Louis Seigner). Zoe is based on a stage farce by Jean Marsan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m0mV9uqpE5nR18FmPp8yDe2aKxO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zoé","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
