The result is an informative, measured and often moving portrait of a man who went from a farm in Washington State to the height of stardom to which the TV series propelled him. Then he had to restart his career after agents and casting directors could no longer imagine him as anything but the Caped Crusader. A highlight is West's appearance, with Burt Ward and Julie Newmar, at 2014's ComicCon.
