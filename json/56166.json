Her parents feud about infidelity; an aging salesman who rents a cottage from them arrives with a young French woman; in Bologna, Angelo's mother frets that her son is marrying beneath him; his sisters are less critical. Early the next morning, the four of them go by train to the farmhouse, joined by Angelo's married, unpregnant sister. The day-long dinner is riotous, couples display affection and impatience, children chase angels. Angelo's family stays the night, and his sister Linda has a visitor. A silver elephant makes the perfect gift.","popularity":0.876,"poster_path":"/szd5fbhPaRvKzuQrZcPVAd8a2Ae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8988,"logo_path":"/A0gkFhxkqEbpKxwuutnS6wP12FC.png","name":"Duea Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":16069,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unione Cinematografica Internazionale","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Boys and Girls","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8}
