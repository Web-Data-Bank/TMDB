Sam Taylor-Johnson isolated the world-famous Ukrainian boxers, known for their brute strength, speed and athleticism, in their dressing rooms immediately after each fight.  She asked them to sit idly while she videoed their still bodies for 3 minutes. The brothers breathe rhythmically and slowly, in an almost meditative state, and we see them away from their public persona as all-conquering fighters.  The vulnerability and humanity of the Klitschko brothers is allowed to come through in a way that echoes the depiction of another famous athlete by Taylor-Johnson, David Beckham.
