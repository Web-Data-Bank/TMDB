From the communal baths, through the kitchen, the infirmary, the sinks and the dormitories at nap time, Cadinot's camera, as light as a breeze, rolls up the shorts and reveals a world of special friendships that we knew, or would liked to have known.  Their candor, tenderness and perversity disturb the adults who surround them: the gardener, the cook, the nurse, and perhaps also the reverend father.","popularity":9.525,"poster_path":"/iwFobeRUtlY9bm1sTqGVNcUeNc7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99016,"logo_path":null,"name":"JDC Studio","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":152146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Videomo Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacré Collège!","video":false,"vote_average":6.833,"vote_count":6}
