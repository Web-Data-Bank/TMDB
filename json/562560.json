Away from the safety of her people, she encounters bigotry against her kind. A little girl feels sorry for the missing gypsy beauty and searches for a magic root that can cure the wandering gypsy from her wanderlust and bring her home again. Music, dance, ancient gypsy rituals, and colorful European scenery highlight this feature which takes a decidedly jaundiced view of the racial indignities suffered by the heroine.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/3sIuKihufcH85a0XUSMRZ5bGowy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gypsy Law","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
