During the day (and sometimes at night), Namblard ventures deep into the forest, audio equipment in tow, to capture sounds no one’s heard before: a bee rubbing its legs together, the drumbeat of marching ants, the songs of nocturnal animals, ice cracking beneath a frozen lake. A magical and beguiling documentary that asks us to reconsider how we see – and hear – our world, In The Stillness of Sounds offers a wondrous appreciation of nature’s ecosystem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5mNnXgYOXPCBo3EpupZ7PK20naH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An appreciation of natures sounds","title":"In the Stillness of Sounds","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
