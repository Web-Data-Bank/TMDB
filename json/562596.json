The museum is appropriately impossible in its scope, as Atherton playfully acknowledges the imaginative space of virtual worlds. The fantasy exhibitors have free rein in their show, “Four Rooms and a Toilet,” even to the point of cutting windows in partitions, exposing the building’s masonry, and breaking down the wall between the sex-segregated toilets. Atherton, as the gallery guide, justifies each of the artists’ disruptive requests in high-art terminology as we “move” through the rooms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gallery Guide","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
