He meets Matthieu and his sister Léa and takes them along in his apparently aimless journey. Matthieu has a crush on Sam and tries to seduce him. Léa is a beautiful, young, provocative girl who likes men so much that she got pregnant. She soon brings along Jérémie with them. Throughout the trip, they learn to know, fight and love each other. In spite of a blooming relationship with Matthieu, Sam isolates himself because of his secret: he is headed for Spain to find his long-lost mother.","popularity":2.854,"poster_path":"/nbRu3zFmkvFxCyjYg8yT5oTWkZs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ad Vitam Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Take the road less travelled","title":"Plein sud","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":33}
