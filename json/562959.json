Inspired by José Martinez’s three-act ballet Les enfants de Scaramouche (a choreography on music by Darius Milhaud that premiered in 2010), this 2014 filmed adaptation highlights the incredible talents of the young students of the Paris National Opera’s Dance School. Roussillon reframes Martinez’s work within a larger story of a boy named Enzo who dreams of becoming an Étoile dancer. He and his young friends at the Nanterre School take over the stage of the Palais Garnier, dancing the story of Scaramouche with a carefree excitement that captures the heart and delights the eyes!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vINt6BfypJ5hrSBt8oa9lLtUIYB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Enfants de Scaramouche","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
