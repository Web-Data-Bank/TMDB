In a staging reminiscent of a movie set, the mime Baptiste bathes in his memories, tell about his encounter with Garance, his impossible love for a marvelous yet unattainable woman, the magical universe of the stage, life behind the scenes, and the tenuous line performers maintain between reality and illusion. Marc-Oliver Dupin's original score provides the musical backdrop for a choreography alternating between larger ensemble numbers and intimate love duets.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pJByOCai7IcSZqIiBQQg4wXaNHF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Enfants du Paradis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
