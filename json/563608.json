This accuses the son-in-law of not having been a good husband; if it had been, Miriam wouldn't have died in a motel with another. But, according to friends Tônia and Tom, the deceased was experiencing a strong nymphomania crisis, hence taking advantage of her husband's absences, who, as a doctor, worked at night at the hospital. Tact finds it hard to conform to what happened. At the same time, Tônia reveals herself sick of her marriage to the voyeur Raul, while the transvestite Jessica, also separated from her husband Roberto, misses the time when she was Zezinho, when she had relations with the peasant Celso. One by one, everyone recalls passages from their lives and the reasons why Miriam would have died.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nh7kYgBJTqCJuM0yLGJczXYYgIc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Galápagos Produções Cinematográficas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1985-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sexo Livre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
