His friends, wife, children. But he wasn't lonely. An old fridge buzzed hoarsely in the corridor, and - substituted for friends and family. Every evening he lay down to die. Waking up the next morning he shambled to the fridge. Every day he would sit down opposite the fridge and write: \"8.00 - turned on; 9.15 - turned off; 9.47 - turned on...\". That day started as usual. The old man woke up alive and headed to the porch. The fridge was in particular nasty. The old man got angry and switched on TV - for the first time in years. It changed his life forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5ydBPNnHN1y5gOs0StS9gPstB3H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145807,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buta films company","origin_country":"AZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Az…ôrbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last One","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":4}
