More than 30 years of research was spent on this release, in which, during a period of the last 20 years, Saint Nicholas and Midwinter rites have been filmed in almost all European countries, as well as outside. For two years it has been perfected and assembled. From over a hundred hours of material, a film was created that sheds a completely different light on the Sinterklaas festival and the issue of Zwarte Piet.
