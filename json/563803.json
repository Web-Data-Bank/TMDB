To each person who comes for a consultation, she offers a short story leading to a waking dream, equal in intensity to a night dream. The surprise provoked by the story, and the shortness of the treatment are, for her, essential aspects of the process. The mental imagery itself allows one to overcome a problem or an illness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4uU6q5kiDajQxGJeysJinCqTMpn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kira B.M.
