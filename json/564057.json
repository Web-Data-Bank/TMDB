The children, petrified yet determined, try hard to keep their spirits high and not give up hope that somehow, someday, their parents will “wake up”. As this uncanny drama unfolds, the stories of the “sleepers” are uncovered through the traces of their absence. A poetic and haunting reflection on loneliness and loss, a silent cry for companionship and human touch.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eynbQqatUVsn0K4RGpX3F0Dex8o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135062,"logo_path":"/zPQGuQgmKZQXc75rDD6BNFnT8qp.png","name":"Rita Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2018-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Will Come Soft Rains","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
