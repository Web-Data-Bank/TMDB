Where Deslaw negativized, I negate —while recovering the original positive images—, drastically reducing the film’s 60 minutes’ length and reversing the images in space and time.  I kept the same soundtrack, although equally compressed into 3 minutes’ length and divided into two channels: one, in the original direction; the other one, reversed.  This negation of a negation is far from being an acceptation: the folk images and songs from a fascist country, underlying the NO-DO shots touched up by Deslaw, are negated; the filmmaker’s intentions when negativizing/negating them are understood; but, seeing that the effort is not enough, this film goes beyond his proposal on the way to total destruction. - Alberte Pagán","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walsed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
