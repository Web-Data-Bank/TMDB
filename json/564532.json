A onetime member of San Francisco’s legendary Cockettes theatre troupe, Goldie was famously crowned Santa Monica College’s 1975 Homecoming Queen, captured in Bruce Yonemoto’s documentary HOMECOMING (1975). GARAGE SALE subverts the drag aspect of Goldie’s performance enabling her to sympathetically play a woman whose fantasies and expectations have been shaped by Hollywood romance films. The film follows the couple as Hero tries to regain Goldie’s love by seeking the advice of a cast of eccentric characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xtnvuX0brzryF8O5ZEwCEtSKJ7V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garage Sale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
