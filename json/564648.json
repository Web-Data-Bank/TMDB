They have two beautiful kids, Brad age 19 and Tiffany 18. The Brody family has lived a very normal and conservative lifestyle in the quite. Just like their other neighbors on Cedar Lane, they have never been tempted by a lifestyle that’s sexually adventurous, let alone depraved. Now, all of this is about to change. A new couple has moved in across the street and there is no telling about them. There is something different, something arcane, something evil about them. These newcomers will take the Brody family, and the entire neighborhood, on a descent into lust, debauchery and perversion. A descent into hell itself, courtesy of “The New Neighbors”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iy1Nj6XDtLP6bWkfh6aTGywJVFI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Something very dark is about to enlighten you.","title":"The New Neighbors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
