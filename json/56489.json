Asked about the positive properties of their Asian spouses, the answer of the Austrian husbands quite often is, \"They don't talk back.\" Protagonist of the film is Karl S., a teacher in Vienna in his forties. Following his failed marriage he is now seeking a durable partnership and is on the lookout for a wife who doesn't question her traditional role. His solution: a wife from the Far East. Karl S. rounds up experiences and visits several mixed couples to get a clearer picture and to have his idea proven right. The film accompanies him on his search for the ideal woman and gives an insight into the imagination of these \"last real men\" who at the beginning seem to have hit the jackpot with their decisions","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yRDTqHmH0cL6AI7vIF1GlxnJOvN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37058,"logo_path":"/pWUIywEOdy0650kBbuRw5aI90zA.png","name":"Lotus-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1995-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Real Men","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5}
