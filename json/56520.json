He is famous among the average Frenchmen. Rivetot, his assistant and technician, always goes with him. He is the only one who knows what really lies under Mortez's appearance of a playful don Juan. When the program is canceled, Rivetot delays telling Mortez as long as possible... Both malicious and tender, this bitter comedy also shows nostalgia.","popularity":4.915,"poster_path":"/iQSg0AnEY69sC0q5ATbkRZlikrz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinéa","origin_country":""},{"id":875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films A2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":582,"logo_path":"/bEORFnCh6xQ3oQuY6yX6mRRCLvW.png","name":"Hachette Première","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1987-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tandem","video":false,"vote_average":7.162,"vote_count":65}
