Reluctantly, Tess agrees. At first, they appear to be polar opposites; clashing over song styles and irritated that they were forced together. However, to their combined surprise, as the album shapes up, they find themselves growing closer over their shared love of music. As they finish the album sparks begin to fly and love blooms just in time for Christmas.","popularity":2.395,"poster_path":"/7Jz7Z2OizB79RZqywNoUqNXxk6E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111475,"logo_path":"/vNz6AhnDHvpiSHSc3OzHyDawr0Z.png","name":"Almost Never Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6679,"logo_path":"/doO7VwcEUnidNW0iUJkIF2oZ8Yq.png","name":"MarVista Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Country Christmas Album","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":8}
