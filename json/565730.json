Since her divorce, she has been fighting to get back custody of her son, who was removed from her because of the supposedly immoral nature of her work. Finley is a camgirl: she earns her living by performing customized sexual scenes online.  Flesh Memory is a document of a few days in her life, which is at once profoundly isolated and populated by virtual presences, a life attuned to screens, to so many distant interfaces connecting her to the outside world. The background to Finleyâ€™s performance life is her custody battle for her son.","popularity":0.952,"poster_path":"/lx62EgXy5YvnSQvNmM5W9RZkJso.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A portrait of Finley, mother and camgirl","title":"Flesh Memory","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":8}
