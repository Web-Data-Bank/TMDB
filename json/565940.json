OBM allows programme content to change according to unique interactions with audiences. The ‘objects’ in OBM refer to the different assets within a given programme. These include large objects like audio and video used to construct a scene in a drama, and small objects, like an individual frame of video, a caption, or a signer. By breaking down a piece of media into separate objects, attaching meaning to each object, and describing how they can be semantically rearranged, a programme can change to reflect an individual viewer’s unique context.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5zBYuQ8POx7TaeTdmypHhQyLAA6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78029,"logo_path":"/qrylL416SnuJZL1SJSzxfvpJfff.png","name":"BBC North","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The \"Living room\" of the future","title":"Living room of the future (FACT edition)","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
