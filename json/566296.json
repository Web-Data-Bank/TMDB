Their story becomes a fascinating case study of Vancouver power relations: how police corruption, racism, homophobia, and a covert \"whites-only\" immigration policy, conspired to maintain the status quo of this colonial port city. Told in four parts, by three separate directors, the film is a hybrid of film forms including drama, documentary and musical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nidolWaOorQ5Tt4AXhKe5a7ptHM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rex vs. Singh","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
