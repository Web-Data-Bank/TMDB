When little Darla is selected to choose the winning ticket, she draws her father's number. The crowd reacts angrily, thinking that the drawing is a fraud, forcing the child to choose another number. This one turns out to be her own ticket, after which a third drawing yields her mother's ticket. While pandemonium erupts in the audience, some gangsters arrive and raid the theater. A chase follows, resulting in the eventual capture of the crooks.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/pVncICAXmZ1HMDzmTN7HOWwMacZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neighborhood House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
