In 2003 they made their first (and so far only) visit to the Montreux Festival. As ever Ian Anderson leads from the front with his instantly recognizable voice and inimitable style of one-legged flute playing. Split into a semi-acoustic first half and a full on electric second half, the concert was a triumph combining newer songs such as “Dot Com”, “Pavane” and “Budapest” with classic favorites.","popularity":1.372,"poster_path":"/5RpU6mnn9PthjAXyX8KUYc1bD0t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11701,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montreux Jazz Festival","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":214,"logo_path":"/qIptM4dZBNflgv2OXzYECv8iQNH.png","name":"Eagle Vision","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2007-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jethro Tull: Live At Montreux 2003","video":false,"vote_average":7.056,"vote_count":9}
