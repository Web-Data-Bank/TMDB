I asked the citizens of the town to physically draw in space the contours of an imagined natural\r landscape or of their own constructed space. I worked with the community council (18 comuneros, all\r men) to make an inventory of all that exists within the town. The inventory was then narrated by a town\r council member through the makeshift speaker system that serves as the town’s preferred method of\r public communication. This project was commissioned for Esbozo para una Ciudad del Futuro, a site specific curatorial project by Laboratorio 060.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2KwbTMZfjeML7nmRkNzmnCqBdHR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inventario","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
