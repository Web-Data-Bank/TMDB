This formula, written down in the 3rd or 4th century, is essential for the creation of a golem -- an artificial person. For ten centuries golems thus created lived in the imaginations of their creators. After that they became corporeal presences that anyone could see. Still later golems could pose real dangers and had to be destroyed by their creators. The notion of the golem is persistent and still evolving.  The Golem, an animated film, was created by drawing directly on clear film stock one frame at a time. There are over 6,000 individual drawings. The film's soundtrack is derived from the earliest manual for golem making; the brevity of the film allows concentration on the essentials of the story. Although every film is, in some sense, an interpretation, The Golem leaves ample room for viewers to find their own meaning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jn1CoSM0W1UTCF457OAuaY3k9Im.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golem","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
