Like all artists and intellectuals of the 1920s, [Malespine] “touched everything,” including architecture, theater and obviously... cinema. We know little, to this day, about the films of Malespine, of which this one looks [...] Exceptionally beautiful, free and inventive. The team which surrounded Malespine (his family?) is having fun in Tree Games. The relationships between architectural geometry and the random geometry of tree branches, between grid and circle figures, between positive and negative freely alternating, between the blurry and the definite, form a dazzling catalog of the plastic obsessions of an era.\" Though extant in silent form, the film was shot and edited to the Fugue in A minor (BWV 543) by Johann Sebastian Bach and the Sonata K.9 (F.525 / L.413) in D minor by Domenico Scarlatti.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aK9yICpZiFurtTEjy4S7VXnLzBh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1931-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fugue in mineur","title":"Arborescent Games: Fugue in Minor","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
