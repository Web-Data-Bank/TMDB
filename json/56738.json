At its pinnacle, the Kop held 27,000 people and is often credited for the birth of football chanting. Many of the Beatles hits could be heard drifting down from the terraces during the sixties, and it is as much a part of the history of Liverpool FC as Shankly, Paisley, Kenny Dalglish, and the five European Cups. The Kop has been the backdrop to many of Liverpool's greatest victories. When history unfolded at Anfield, it had the habit of happening at the Kop end. From the glory days of the '70s through to Steven Gerrard's blockbuster strike against Olympiakos, the Kop has been the canvas for some of football's tales.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LFC 100 Years Of The Kop","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
