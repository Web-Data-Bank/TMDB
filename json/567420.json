The M-Decree obliges schools to adapt to the needs of children. This documentary observes in beautiful black and white how four children with different special needs experience going to a normal school. Inclusief is not a rushed TV report or reality series that panders to your emotions, but a carefully made, cinematic film that offers an intimate insight into the lives of four children, Rosie, Sami, Irakli and Nathan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Exa1DQ5pupfVFfbIYicnxnD6Xq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inclusive","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
