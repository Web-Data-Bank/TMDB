All but one: the hippen Crevel, who lives with the anguished feeling of not re-testing the meat. Decided to calm his hatred, one night Crevel goes to the cemetery ready to devour the corpses, but he can not do it, because there is none. The lion Persius and his consigliere, the tiger Altaicus, organized a whole nutritional network with the dead to keep their carnivorous habits. When discovered, they accuse Crevel of the brutal desecration, forcing him to flee from the wrath of the herbivores.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/btoDk7lS0YsuouJQg8ugltL8eh2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xunta de Galicia","origin_country":""},{"id":10050,"logo_path":"/SowPJ8W5Gy6OgyAFyWnv4KjcPo.png","name":"TVG","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":112679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nicodemo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2007-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animal Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":8}
