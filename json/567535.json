That sounds technical, (and the film does include accurate information about accessibility standards), but it stars Faggotgirl, a butch dyke super-hero action figure. This short is affirming of transgender/GNC people and people with diverse mobility methods.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ipgmpFfI52SVyvtGHq1ez0eADF0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faggotgirl Gets Busy in the Bathroom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
