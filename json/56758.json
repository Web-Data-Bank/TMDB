What you hold in your hands is the continuing story of our band, what it means to us, and what it means to people like you. At our request, all the live footage you see in the DVD is completely unedited; meaning we didn't go back and fix or re-do anything. We felt it should stand or fall on its own merit, and be embraced for what is, which is live music. Who knows, maybe we'll feel differently next year. But for now, the moments are captured raw as we make our way to another station: another mile.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Station: Another Mile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
