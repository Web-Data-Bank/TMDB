Only UV-active materials glow in this light, everything else remains invisible to the human eye. The film tells a story of an archetypical character “human”, whose convictions are confronted with the new reality.\r The question of faith and perception is as old as humanity itself, but it remains relevant. Only the fear of the new is enormous. When the exterior framework collapses, when certain coordi- nates break, the temptation appears to come back to old structures and values.\r The goal of the film is to encourage viewers to start questioning. “Nothing is what it seems” is the message which the film wants to convey using the unusual mean of the black light. In every complete belief system, one sees only what one knows. Also, when there is more to it we want to provoke to look behind the horizon and enter the new world. But what does the world of nothingness look like?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7j8ksUewQXEnxxsWB2nEWirihsU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"doors of perception","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
