Using maps, stills, 1960s film and sound, and contemporary footage, the story of the line from 1845 to its closure in 1966 is told. The film features a cab ride of the line immediately prior to closure. We also revisit the redundant track-bed in the late 1990s, searching for reminders of former times. Most of the archive film was taken by Rev. Robert Jackson, whom we meet some 30 years on with his memorabilia of the line.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Pioneer Line: Lancaster - Morecambe - Heysham Electrics","title":"The Pioneer Line: Lancaster - Morecambe - Heysham Electrics","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
