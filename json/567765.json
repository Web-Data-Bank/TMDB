The actors and actresses have to support themselves with odd jobs ranging from selling food and drinks on the streets to dancing at bars to doing commercials. Then comes a great play, written and directed by Teacher Nguyen Dinh, a veteran playwright, and former troupe mentor. The play promises to bring the group everything they need: inspiring work, state funding, festival prizes, and fame. But the rising tension between lead actress Kim Ha and her womanizing co-star Van Hung due to their troubled past relationship threatens to tear the play apart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zRvgzOzj70t517ZcLz2E7OoHKW2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7753,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hang Phim Truyen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Backstage Slap","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
