But any 'dangerous' dog owner knows that the key to taming the breed is to handle with care, or rather, with proper training, a strong lead and a muzzle in tow. Through an intimate look into the relationships between several canine lovers and their pets, Pitbull reveals that these dogs are not nearly as fearsome as they seem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wZa2dg70wr1CmLjLAu7t0XZ86jb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Journeyman Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pitbull","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
