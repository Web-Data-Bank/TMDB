Again, it’s Bob rather than Terry who is visibly distressed by this. Upset and much the worse for free alcohol, Bob then storms into the library to seek sympathy from Thelma - who is, predictably, unimpressed. So when Thelma finds out that Terry has been getting semi-serious with glamorous Finnish shop assistant Chris, she takes it upon herself to try and pair them off for good via planning first a dinner party and then that mainstay of 70s comedy, a camping expedition. Of course, things don’t go quite according to plan and before you can say ‘I can see the way this is going’ we are set up for japes, larks and embarrassing incidents aplenty, which culminate in the lads getting rather fed up with their partners’ attempts to inflict the rugged outdoor lifestyle upon them and trying to hitch up and drive off with the girls still asleep in the caravan.","popularity":1.983,"poster_path":"/24HZR6BAINH6AvM5fjxxuKJPt4M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":538,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMI Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anglo-EMI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Emotion blazes across the big screen as Bob and Terry knock down the frontiers of human knowledge and Newcastle ale.","title":"The Likely Lads","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":14}
