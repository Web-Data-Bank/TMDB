But when the fact that Paul has never coached, let alone played, basketball could cost both of them their jobs, they seek out Daniel Buckworth, the town's local psychic, for help. Buckworth's plan to summon spirits to help the girls win games fails when instead of just communicating with them, they accidentally awaken them in the form of zombies. Main Street has seen its better days as it gets ready for a three way battle royal between the slasher, zombies, and a group of friends who may be this small town's only hope for survival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/obKFzacgY8wXju67e4HXFchlMmS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113488,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZSS Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"More than the gas prices will kill you on Main Street","title":"Monsters on Main Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
