He longs to ride with the notorious stunt bike group known as Team Domina on their illegal “ride-outs” through the city. There are sometimes more than 100 riders, doing extended wheelies and other stunts amid the busy traffic. The riders set off from the southern suburbs and head for the wealthier north bank of the river. In a ride-out, the kids from the south manage to get themselves seen by the northerners—but also by the police, who crack down on their dangerous stunt riding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ofkng6dEyZ0myzgx9VJJzOoZpv1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72500,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tangerine Tree","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"180cc","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
