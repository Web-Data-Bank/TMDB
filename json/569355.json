These images often appear to be one fantastic undulating face perpetually changing. The images are shot thru a circular mat in an attempt to get away from the dominant rectangular film image (much as earlier filmmakers have done). I have recently added a sound track, on separate cassette tape. It is the Talking Head’s ‘Seen and Not Seen.’ The film can be viewed with or without the track—or first with, then without.
