Having left the village to pursue a formal education at Cambridge School of Art at just 16, and begin a life and career that would see him travel all over the world; performing with and meeting his Bluegrass Heroes - the likes of Bill Monroe, Hank Williams, Dolly Parton. Old Suffolk Boys provides an insight into an area of Eastern England, as well as a man who is returning to his roots - entrenched with pickup trucks, a dash of conservative politics and a deep-rooted love of country music, that will surely resonate with audiences.","popularity":1.23,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29116,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Westminster","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"John Holder returns to the village he grew up, Badwell Ash, reconnecting with family and friends from the past and encountering stories - of growing up and growing old in Suffolk, as well as ones of mischief, intrigue and of history.","title":"Old Suffolk Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
