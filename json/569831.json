With exclusive access to its 400-year-old archive, its members around the country and its grand master, who presides over 1,000 lodges and 100,000 Scottish Freemasons worldwide, we film at lodge meetings, the selection of new candidates and the installation of grand masters.  This documentary explores the truth about an organisation characterised by many for funny handshakes and rolled trouser legs, and by others as a dangerous, secret society, \"the hidden hand that has shaped Scotland\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2UOWhrZVPXBkuBv3omcKesOS4vS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secrets Of The Masons","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
