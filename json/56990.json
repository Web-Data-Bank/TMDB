The movie is an adaption from a Norwegian children's novel by Kari Vinje, and is the first feature film of renowned Norwegian actor Dennis Storh√∏i and also stars '80s pop idol Morten Harket in a minor role. Kamilla and the Thief was a huge success in Norway, selling half a million tickets (in a country of 4.5 million people). It was so popular that a sequel was made, Kamilla and the Thief II, which was released the year after. In 2005 both movies were digitally restored and released on DVD.","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/e4d21O0HyjtOz0CwbeD3nun2LNq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81897,"logo_path":null,"name":"Penelope Film AS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1988-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kamilla and the Thief","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8}
