Kuchar’s magic was his ability to see the cinematic potential in everything around him—here, he finds endearing humor in three friends trying to work a landline phone. It became a tradition for Kuchar to break out the camera during his friends’ holiday festivities, but HOLIDAZE is unique for its visual verve, with lo-fi effects reminiscent of an arcade game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uppywjKp2KrVbyjC5P4gs3DvbR6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video Data Bank","origin_country":""},{"id":75133,"logo_path":null,"name":"School of the Art Institute of Chicago","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“A time of cheer and chill, giving and getting, chomping and chewing.”","title":"Holidaze, 1994","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
