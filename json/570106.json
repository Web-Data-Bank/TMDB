Wayne and Garth. Mike Myers knew his \"Wayne's World\" was big, but it wasn't until Aerosmith came to Saturday Night Live as a musical guest in February 1990 and all but demanded to be included in a WW sketch, that he knew just how big.\r Wayne and Garth and Aerosmith. The sketch, as you see from the audience's riotous response on this Best of '89 tape, is clear confirmation that the boys-in-the-basement were now in the pop-culture penthouse.\r And, the fact is, they had lost of SNL company. By '89, after three years together, this generation of SNL'ers had rooted a forest of catch phrases and characters into the pop landscape.\r Check out the response here to Dana Carvey's Church Lady. Obviously something special. His President Bush? Wouldn't be prudent to not point out that most of America no longer hears George without thinking of Dana.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best Of Saturday Night Live: 1989","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
