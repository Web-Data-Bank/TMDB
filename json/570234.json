About the all- activity center Gamla Bro in Stockholm 1969-1972. The film tells of the difficulties that arose during general meetings and in the face of a rigid and controlling bureaucracy. The activists' passion and utopian-romantic ideology were gradually broken down as another reality asserted itself, while the house became filled with older alcoholics, homeless people and drug addicts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bxZs7AAkzF1eGO0LyiRsdQogJ1H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malmö Art Academy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Det var en tid då allt var möjligt - All makt åt fantasin!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
