In this unusual drama, the family (and one friend) of the troubled artist gather together to participate in the customary ceremonies that are performed when a close relative, in this case, Vincent, dies. While Vincent's brother Theo (Jean-Pierre Lorit) and his three sisters are genuinely grief-stricken, his mother (Maria Meriko) seems to be a truly stony character, and her cold contempt and disregard for her sensitive son appears to be just as great in death as it was in life. Fans of Vincent's art will be particularly appalled by the woman's attitude to her son's vocation, and more so by at her actions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Van Gogh Wake","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
