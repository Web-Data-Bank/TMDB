The processing of the image surface emphasizes the materiality of the medium, and turns the medium of film itself into a subject. This film even undermines the essential characteristic of the medium – the sequence of single images that suggests movement – by also showing the filmstrip itself. The cinematic illusion is broken, and at the same time it is shown as film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dbQN3TGGwSI285j5K3dRywHN2Kd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Shot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
