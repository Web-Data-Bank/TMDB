Meet the men behind the camera, such as \"King of Sexploitation\" Dave Friedman and the preeminent breast man Russ Meyer. Considered pariahs at the time, they're now hailed as pioneers in the fight against censorship. The Story of X visits the 60s when women's rights, not nudity, became the issue and recounts porn's arrival in Hollywood, led by director Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris. In the 70s, several groundbreaking films, including Behind The Green Door featuring Marilyn Chambers and Deep Throat featuring Linda Lovelace, took the genre to a new level.","popularity":2.634,"poster_path":"/xQ5ELwl7uyeGih1mI8uYSKYm0Hj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"100 Years of Adult Film and Its Stars","title":"Playboy: The Story of X","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
