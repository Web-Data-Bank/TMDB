There, they see Lisa. Alexandre is the shy one, but he is also the one with the greatest yen to meet such a woman. He and Romain track Lisa down the next day and, though she is already dating someone, when Romain approaches her, she agrees to meet the two of them at a restaurant. They are dismayed when the part-Italian girl brings her mother with her as a chaperone. Other difficulties arise as well, and they resolve that this quest is less important than their friendship. Besides, Alexandre has by now discovered the charms of Romain's younger sister.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hB3tHpnQXR0kltTMKpyUnZ2g2pF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Simpson Performance \u0026 Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":13708,"logo_path":null,"name":"Acteurs Auteurs Associés (AAA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ragazzi","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
