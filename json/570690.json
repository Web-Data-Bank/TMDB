Into their deepest desires and fears. Into their humanity. But what about yourself? Who are you? You walk the streets towards a destination we do not know. You meet a woman whose relationship to you is unclear. You remain a ghost, who needs to wash off make-up, a mask, a second personality which you squeeze yourself into for a couple of hours every day. You're the one who smiles for us, who shows us who we are and who disappears in the shadow of ourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sy2p0lVhTfbbjoPqfsrSKZKfS71.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Drifting across the outer edges of a concrete landscape, a twilight meeting engenders a precious moment of connection for a melancholy performer, amid the coldly apathetic city limits.","title":"1000 Smiles Per Hour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
