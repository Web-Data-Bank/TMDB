Unfortunately, none of the men she currently knows are interested in going to bed with her, including her business partner, who just might be sexually attracted to trees but certainly isn't to her. That being the case, it is particularly galling that he gets jealous at the very notion of her having sex with business clients. Eva discusses these issues (and a great deal more) with her similarly forty-ish gal-pals.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/jC1q2GwuqG4nyFiWG1jOemZxLfb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pas d'amour sans amour!","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
