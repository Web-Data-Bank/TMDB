The young woman faces many obstacles. Though she is in her twenties, Mimouna is forced to live with her domineering father and his traditionally submissive wife. Her younger siblings have eschewed Algerian traditions, and so does Mimouna, but only to a point, for she can also see the value of keeping her cultural heritage alive.
