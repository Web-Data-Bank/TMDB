Our heroine is the neglected child of a businessman father and actress mother. Feeling that happiness lies well outside her own backyard, Eva goes on a search for that happiness. The longer she stays away, the more her parents realize that they've unfairly ignored her. The plot is nothing new: it's what is done with it that pleases the eye and ear. Ingen tid til Kaertegn was one of the more popular entries in the 1957 Berlin Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8CIFDTDKuLGVErHXm3yZI6zEXFd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9370,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flamingo Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1957-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be Dear to Me","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
