They are helped economically by Pierpaolo, Luca’s seventeen-year-old son from a previous relationship. Pierpaolo lives in an Art Nouveau house with his mother and grandfather, an important trial lawyer of cases linked to politics who rakes in several million euros a year. In the setting of a magnificent and incomprehensible Rome, both a good mother and a bad one, Mary Ann, a deeply Catholic student of art history from Ireland, au pair for the little Lucilla, is caught in the middle.","popularity":4.599,"poster_path":"/aWqrMRiA4bez1qfLtB5rewB9rfi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19916,"logo_path":"/dOQ7UtUAqydn5zmx3qElFIMqn6t.png","name":"Lotus Production","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":118025,"logo_path":"/47UYD8fQHJ4ueenwibNNWGKIR4j.png","name":"3 Marys Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivere","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":57}
