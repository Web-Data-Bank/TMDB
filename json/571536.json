The film is built on conversations between me (the director) and God (my psychotic mum), whose face we never see in the film. We talk about her worlds; We encounter her flower language, we meet the devil’s birds and we learn how to marry the wind. The film turns into a declaration of love - to the crooked mind as well as to my mother.\" - Maria Bäck","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oQAKhGYUHoU1veSCZC6osRpxNWh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother is God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
