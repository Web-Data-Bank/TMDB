The woman is run down by a ghostly Land Rover and disappears. Meanwhile, her beau comes to a big old house where he is taken in by an old and lonely man. It doesn't take long for the young man to realize that his host is wacko and terrified of dying and is willing to take extreme measures to prevent this from happening. Though billed as a thriller, director Michael Ferry chose to focus on the inner thoughts and fears of the protagonists rather than exciting action sequences. All of the violence occurs off screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uCNzSw3LKVaD9ph4XCl3vk0x12w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hantises","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
