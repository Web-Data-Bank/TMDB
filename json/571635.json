The U.S. space program suffered a bitter setback when Apollo 1 ended in a deadly fire during a pre-launch run-through. In disarray, and threatened by the prospect of a Soviet Union victory in the space race, NASA decided upon a radical and risky change of plan: turn Apollo 8 from an earth-orbit mission into a daring sprint to the moon while relying on untried new technologies. Fifty years after the historic mission, the Apollo 8 astronauts and engineers recount the feats of engineering that paved the way to the moon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/68nKc4nSfyDzvGORoCDqGpkOtG5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Apollo astronauts and engineers tell the inside story of the first manned mission to the moon.","title":"Apollo's Daring Mission","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
