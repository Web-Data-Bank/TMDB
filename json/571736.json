From the heat and uncertainties of Brazil to the cliff-hanging finale in Portugal some 16 races later, the season was a winner in terms of drama, interest and excitement.  1984 was also the year the racing world witnessed a new name soon to be on everyone’s lips: Ayrton Senna.  For Lauda, the eventual winner, the title was a particularly sweet one as it came seven years after his previous title in ‘77. Prost’s achievements were just as impressive, winning a record seven races to finish within a point of Lauda at the end.  New fuel rules gave all teams plenty to think about and in Germany the Nürburgring’s rebirth gave drivers a new challenge to consider.  The story of the season is brilliantly narrated by Clive James.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/snTDGTSxRF6R9JSL0jSGfhNRjoF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1984","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
