As in most of these Taiwanese films, slapstick comedy alternates with intense action. An absurd plot has something to do with missing bullion and a treasure map. Yamashita’s gang wants it, and so do an unlikely band of heroes, including an incompetent traffic cop, his cop wannabe girl friend, and a couple of card sharks who have teamed up with an infatuated gas station owner. Some of Taiwan’s best action actors provide excellent kung fu action.","popularity":1.264,"poster_path":"/ni35lL2GSW82d7D123dUnJC5zuN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema City Company Limited (Hong Kong)","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":88666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Princess Amusement Co., Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1986-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Book of Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
