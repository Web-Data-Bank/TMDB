This arty, metaphorical French film presents three examples of Jean's difficulties over the course of his long life. Each of the three episodes takes place beside the same river. He is first seen as a small boy playing on the river banks with the teenage girl he secretly loves. She mischievously promises to tell him her darkest secret if only he will perform a certain task for her. The story then takes a more surreal turn as a now-grown Jean, once again beside the river, toys with a beautiful woman at a picnic. She wants a commitment from him, but wily Jean is unwilling to satisfy her. In the final segment, Jean has become an old man and is once again deeply in love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bZ26X1uaNxret2yCbNU1iqz4OIW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Lazennec","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":157982,"logo_path":null,"name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1996-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Waters Run Deep","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
