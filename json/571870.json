In Dieter Dorn’s production, the characters are real people of flesh and blood, their emotions and conflicts intelligible to every member of the audience. The cast includes some of the finest Mozart singers of our day, headed by the British tenor John Mark Ainsley in the title role, while Kent Nagano in the orchestra pit appears to unleash an elemental force of nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5KwMy6qr70oTUeKqZYzncyNHKcQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92079,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":176,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: Idomeneo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
