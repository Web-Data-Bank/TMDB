Her hope is that time has healed the open wound of hostility between herself and her alcoholic older brother Adrien. Amelie dusts off an ancient motorcycle, revs it up, and practices riding inside the immense sphere of metal latticework constructed by her late father. The local popularity of this stunt suggests a broader appeal plus profits, so soon the act goes on the road, where emotions spin out of control.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y1s1Sgfrw20lHHYC8LpFZMbgof2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Violetta, the Motorcycle Queen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
