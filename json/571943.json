It is likely to be even more difficult to do so after witnessing his versatile performance in his latest tour. \"The Sixth Day & Seventh Night\" tour had it final show on July 4, 2004 and this lively show was chosen to be released on DVD. New band members were added for this concert, and the sound is heavier and tighter than usual, with Gackt and his band putting on an entertaining experimental performance. The stage costumes are designed by famous designer h.NAOTO.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qahbQ5KzobzmDTL1Q6LuXyiKhrD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nippon Crown","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gackt Live Tour 2004 THE SIXTH DAY & SEVENTH NIGHT ~FINAL~","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
