He's spotted by the assailant, but Slimami manages to slip away before being caught. The victim turned out to be a prominent businessman, and police are soon searching for the witness as well as the killers. Slimami does not want to step forward, both as a matter of personal safety and because he prefers to let the French police handle their own affairs. His son Alilou, a budding journalist, openly decries the failure of the witness to come forward as a black mark on the Muslim community in Paris, unaware that the man in question is his father.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pfDxi0xQ4EMiPvNl7WfaMW1MsV7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night of Destiny","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
