The work is a spiritual portrait of a place and time. It is, as is Cabanas, willfully slow, meditative, passive. It has no evident narrative, though I hope I was able in my editing and other choices to impart a kind of slowly developing momentum which functions vaguely like a narrative, or like the melodic line in a piece of music. Finally LUZ is about light, and philosophically about life, and our place on this planet, and its place in the universe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pRol2E4zFcaQ673VM1LxfFXhv7T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Rays of Light of Ria Formosa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
