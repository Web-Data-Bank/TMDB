There is no evident architecture or human presence. Text flashes up on the screen which builds a narrative about these objects, the institution which holds them and the desire for consumerism. The work is accompanied by an immersive soundtrack developed especially for the video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/crCVx3LdArP1vv2c5PWx5oqH1E3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"User Group Disco","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
