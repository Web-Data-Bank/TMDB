The extensive postproduction work on an Optical Printer has been completed in Germany, and the reknown German bass-musician Eberhard Weber made the wonderful soundtrack while watching the film. To me this film is like an elaborate tapestry woven by thousands of fade-ins and fade-outs. It feels like stepping into a river and getting carried along.\" Bastian Clev√©","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/DjVNtN30RDAnEKi6sn5zj4OlNl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Francisco Zephyr","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
