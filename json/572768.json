Her dour parents, members of a religious sect, forbid the celebration of birthdays or holidays. Melinda finds solace in small things: a spun silver spider web, her box of treasures, and a stolen afternoon at Silver Lake on her \"day of days.\" As the movie and the year progresses, Melinda experiences ageless comforts and pains. A disgraced famous writer and a waylaid college professor, two exiles in the small Mid-Western town, haunt the edges of her sheltered life. An earthy, warmhearted waitress introduces her to the blues and a fizzy drink called Cola-Cola. She receives her first explorative attention from a boy. Escalating tragedy shatters Melinda's innocence. Devastated, she flees into the night where, by drawing on her tenacious spirit, she ultimately triumphs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8HsgkbSOXE7nctM9mXxRq0LeMVW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dawntreader Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melinda's World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
