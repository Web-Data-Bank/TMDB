The story begins with the three comedians running here and there, exploiting every opportunity toward humor. Initially, Dono becomes enamored of a belly dancer, whom Indro hits on while Dono is away. It turns out that the belly dancer is being used by a blackmailer to extort money. Then the trio embarks on an effort to make a beer commercial with a chubby actress, Yuli (Tarida Gloria), who makes a big mess of the film shoot. Whatever storyline exists then disintegrates into a series of totally unrelated comedic sketches.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aXigQ3NGXBpW4OHaoqFESpLbMWb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soraya Intercine Films","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1992-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salah Masuk","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
