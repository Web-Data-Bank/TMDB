Childhood friends, André Fontaine and Michel Leroy find themselves in the Alps. André had been walking around France for three years with a baby bather who spit fire and gave him a line in the street. As for Michel, he was moping around in a Montreal bar. Without admitting it, they needed each other. The duo quickly reunited and traveled to Paris in a Citroën Acadiane, equipped like a house, where fame awaited them. Michel discovers the \"Old Country\" and his thirst for recognition is coupled with a quest for identity, that of his Breton origins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w6E9JLLteZrruaLBpKKJD8vxwaR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un voyage entre amis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
