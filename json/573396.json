The 20 year-old from Ventura, widely acknowledged as the most exciting young surfer in the world, has dedicated over a year to film this project. It's rare for a surfer of Dane's caliber to dedicate an extended break from competition for filming, but the final result is well worth it. \"First Chapter\" features some of most revolutionary surfing ever caught on film as Dane goes to places and spaces on waves and in the air that no one has ever seen. The loose, movie within a movie, structure of the project is also noteworthy as is its soundtrack filled with Daneâ€™s favorite indie rock bands. This film was shot in location in Morocco, Portugal, France, Australia, Hawaii and California.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zTeEZU8BvtDLqhVuZab7bKKaIk3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quiksilver","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dane Reynolds: First Chapter","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
