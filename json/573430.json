First of all what they claim: their city, their Kabylie, their 20 years. Young people from immigrant backgrounds, Farid, Naguib and Abdel Ouab Taalba claim all the more clearly their desire to be young: to be themselves. At the time when they may be summoned to declare their identity, they say let us our questions. Their place? It's a diary of immigrant youth, a boxing gym, a faculty, but also the suburban commute, the trip to Kabylia. The shooting of the film? It was during six months, the young people and the filmmaker, alone with the image and the sound. The time for questions to arise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Question d'identité","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
