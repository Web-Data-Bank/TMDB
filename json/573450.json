Look elsewhere denounces what is happening in many European cities by taking the example of Calais. From the expulsion from the \"jungle\" in October 2016 to the situation there a year later, Arthur shared moments of life with men and women of Sudanese, Afghan, Ethiopian, Eritrean and local descent of Calais. By highlighting the gap between the field and the official speeches, this film shows us the strategy put in place to dissuade the exiles from staying. With original filming methods and his civic gaze, the director has managed to film the state harassment, the media staging, but also the strength and humor of the exiles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xAXEe2DR36b8zKAsK2LmDtCqrKX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Actividéo","origin_country":""},{"id":114793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diopside Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Look Away","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
