In this journey appears the memory of a photo for Karin Eitel, a young woman, tortured and detained during the dictatorship, to whom I owe my name. A story that my parents never told me, brings me closer to Karin and not just because of my name. In the background, the memory of a childhood in Chile, a country that reconstructed its democracy omitting its own history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y83uXNwyCUVLk6QZTsImFKcoC7o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pequén Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":83545,"logo_path":"/fkMCjb5BHOJ56BdYfM6JEunRKp7.png","name":"Cinestación","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":28170,"logo_path":null,"name":"3 Moinhos Produções Artísticas","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2019-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A peculiar coincidence","title":"Story of My Name","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
