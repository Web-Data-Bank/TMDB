Rob lives a secret double life: big law firm partner by day, stage performer by night. His one-man show, the 'Midlife Crisis Cabaret,' is juvenile but not meant for kids. Rob's family puts up with the show, his boss knows nothing about it, and his protege is caught in the middle. DAY JOB tells the story of the night these two worlds collide, when Rob must decide what he's willing to risk losing for a chance at having it all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xLj6sbpoohYemSyLohAhozuUKTP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day Job","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
