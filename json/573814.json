His constant strolls through streets, houses and beaches are recorded in notes of what he saw, felt or thought during these wanderings or moments, but almost only recalling the processes, the timeline in which things occur and come to mind, the trail of associations coming one after the other, like the steps of a person walking along a street. Immediate impressions, fleeting moments normally lost in time and which are captured in the images and sounds of this film.","popularity":0.66,"poster_path":"/r9YimsSrZeMtkRg1HNAHWovaV3H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Globo Rojo","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2018-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Things That Happened to Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
