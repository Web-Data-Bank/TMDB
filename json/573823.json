At the trial he pleads in opposition to his own lawyers. He explains that he is now too old to be of any assistance to his widowed daughter and his grand-children who are dependent on him for support. He says he prefers death to a life of poverty and wretchedness. In telling the judge and jury his pathetic story (which is shown on the screen) old Joel betrays a love for his grandchildren and his fellow laborers that is poignant with pathos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tLx7Ww175uoyaPtV0gTPhKigO0b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The High Cost of Living","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
