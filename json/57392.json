Because there are, most of the time, the first victims in war-time and left to their own during peace-time, JR pays tribute to those women who, in spite of the hurdles, keep smiling, keep fighting and keep hoping a better life. From Rio’s shantytowns to Kenyan slums, passing by Indian and Cambodian streets, he offers a fresh look at their struggles and expectations. Displaying their portraits via huge montages on their neighborhood’s walls, JR sublimates those extraordinary destinies and sheds the lights on those strong and moving personalities, too rarely recognized enough.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jDnVW647lWimLOMVkGKhgidwcVY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60815,"logo_path":null,"name":"27.11 Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women Are Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":6}
