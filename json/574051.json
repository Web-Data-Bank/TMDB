Of course there had been fights, but the strong and intelligent Lion King always managed to settle them.  The Panther however had been envious on the power of the king for a long time. When the lioness got a baby and the lion did not worry so much about the animals, the Panther instigated the animals against their king. The Lion and his family were brought out of the jungle and the Panther ruled like a tyrant.  The lion baby grew up far away from his homeland. One day he heard from the birds, how much the animals in the jungle had suffered from the Panther’s cruelty. He started thinking, how to help the animals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7gXiZYKK3Abt3B4Z5IjJYodgF0P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dingo Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King of the Animals","video":false,"vote_average":3.333,"vote_count":3}
