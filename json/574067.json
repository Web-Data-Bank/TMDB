Overnight, a young and inexperienced policeman has to secure the crime scene. Since he is not familiar with the dangers on site, a local herder is sent to guard him and the body. This resolute woman in her mid-thirties knows how to handle a rifle – and how to scare away wolves. She lights a fire against the cold. Alcohol also helps them to stay warm.

The next morning, they will go their separate ways.","popularity":1.57,"poster_path":"/2eSAn1ixjjhvXIIUJsF7b8LHlCj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"MN","name":"Mongolia"}],"release_date":"2019-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The woman of the steppes, the cop, and the egg","title":"Egg","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":27}
