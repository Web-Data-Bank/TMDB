Since then, Glyndebourne has become a byword for excellence, bringing together the finest operatic musicians of the day for extended rehearsals in an idyllic setting with uncompromised technical and theatrical standards. This celebration includes 12 productions from the last 13 years within the musical directorship of Vladimir Jurowski, ranging across ‘signature’ works such as The Marriage of Figaro, classic productions such as The Rake's Progress with designs by David Hockney, and new adventures in Baroque opera and Wagner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tiAQrliyzLZK93EisVrDVCVzu4t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"See opera differently","title":"Glorious Glyndebourne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
