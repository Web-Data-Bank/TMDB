Her last challenge is to make a movie on May 68. It's a challenge, not only because she will be forced to face a story that is not hers, but specially because her new boyfriend, Blaise, doesn't understand this idea, even more, he hates people that have participated at this event. Anne Buridan is a methodical person and even a bit obsessive. Nothing and nobody will make her turn away from her project. She starts to meet people that were figures of that period. She will start, evidently, with a woman, Marianne, who speaks amongst others, of Jean-Pierre Lucciani. The name is not unknown to her because it's the same as Blaise's. She will go see him right away. Jean-Pierre is Blaise's father alright. She goes back home and keeps the secret from Blaise. Anne Buridan just lost, without knowing it, control over this situation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b7AWnrU0k1Z0M1P8VkQXMHXiGeu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Code 68","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
