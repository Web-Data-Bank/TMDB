One more strange than the other, we get to meet jovial salesman Goggen Rask, car mechanic Bottolph Johansen, nicknamed daydreamer, and ship-owner Rieber Larsen Jr. They form an unruly faction which Major Kampstrup struggles to maintain structured and prepared, not to mention keeping them inside the camp premises before they pretend sick to see the nurses Bitten and Florence.  The men do their best to get through their rigourous training, with great confusion and comical situations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mPkmstb1X0eKtbFphyVdm7SrcNk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norena Film","origin_country":""},{"id":14623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teamfilm AS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operasjon Løvsprett","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
