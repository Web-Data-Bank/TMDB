The images are interspersed with one another: a man and a woman are painted with white paint, while another couple is wrapped in paper and coloured with paint.  The second part of the film also consists of a performance. This time, Luyken works with life-sized, cartoon-like fantasy figures. Eventually they are numbered and wrapped in white paper.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entr'acte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
