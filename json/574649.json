I then hand processed the film in a very sloppy manner. I never mounted the film into slides I simply took the 35mm strips of film and spliced them together. Some of the rolls used in this film were shot by random people I sent a roll of film to that they shot and sent back to me.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6owuDM8bDAJi8rStpkH41amCcBZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kodachrome Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
