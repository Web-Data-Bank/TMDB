The viewer sees the eyeball darting around and also sees what the eyeball sees as well. The week has been condensed down to 9 min. This film was an experiment that worked. I shot all the eyeshots using my friend Letitia Tyler on 200ft of film and shot all the other shots on another 200ft. I then cut the negative together without ever seeing what the film looked like projected. I just wanted the editing process to be all part of the eye theme. I was hoping that it would all say something, and it does.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vpX8df2wDfIBf9V6kshdMt9Tk99.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fluffy Fluffy Calm Calm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
