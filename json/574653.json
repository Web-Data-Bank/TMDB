I saw some very incredible images that night and got to meet the grand master himself. I was so inspired by what I saw and the people that I met that the moment that I returned home to Seattle I made this film. My first fully hand painted motion picture, and the techniques that I used in this film are the beginning of an entirely new faze of my filmmaking and I hope to master this technique some day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1yIH6pmB4dOSeTbjkhKVeubEm3J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stan's Salon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
