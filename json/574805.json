From the iconic Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao to LA's Walt Disney Concert Hall, Gehry's buildings both intrigue and ignite. For Frank, rules are there to be broken. Alan Yentob explores Gehry's remarkable journey from poor outsider in Toronto to global 'starchitect' and follows the construction of a characteristically audacious new Gehry building in Sydney - his first in Australia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9cWWfdcuFyonvwN9W45aZITUTzG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frank Gehry: The Architect Says \"Why Can't I?\"","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
