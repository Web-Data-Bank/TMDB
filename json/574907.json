Their remarkable journey over the past 20 years has often intersected with notions of identityâ€”as artists, as individuals, as sisters, as queer women, and as leading activists in the LGBTQ community. Their musical progression parallels and amplifies their commitment to bringing the marginal to the mainstream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fi2We37TMA51mTmuhUSQDh3vrR7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Short Film About Tegan & Sara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
