JoAnn Elam is seen knitting, presumably nearby, before entering the kitchen and proceeding to cook popcorn on the stovetop. Each step is filmed in extreme close-up, with an emphasis on hands and tactility. This attention to process is similar to other films from Elam, notably \" Chocolate Cake \" (F.2011-01-0166). At the end of \"Popcorn,\" following a flurry of light leak and mis-aligned optical printing, the boy happily eats the popped and seasoned kernels. The exact date of production remains unknown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fBxIGuHt2sS3JS3OQKrTlactRBq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Popcorn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
