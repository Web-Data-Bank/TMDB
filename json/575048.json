In the first half of the film, it appears that JoAnn Elam experiments with projecting film of fireworks and filming it again off the screen, superimposing the explosions. At different parts, the projection zooms in and out, adding pulsating boxes to the other forms and colors illuminating the dark. In the second half, headlights join the fray, and the film builds to chaos before slowing down to capture the streaking lights at the very end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celebrated Royal Fireworks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
