Camera in hand, Elam follows co-workers as they deliver the mail throughout various Chicago neighborhoods. Elam's construction of this film-in-progress creates a lovely cadence and rhythm that transforms the repetitive motions of the postal worker -- pushing the mail cart, carrying the bag, avoiding the dogs, opening the gates, and climbing the steps to the front door -- to something poetic yet startlingly familiar. Their stories (heard mostly in voice-over) are those of everyday people who at the time struggled with issues of race and gender in relationship to their work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bzTe8gUNFFiae47ffjplQW7ZJLE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everyday People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
