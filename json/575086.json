Mr. Maurice, the head storekeeper, took him out of an orphanage and has become the father René never had. René has a dream. He wants to be a great Blues guitarist, like his idol, a British guitarist of the 70s. The Blues seems the only thing on earth that gives him pleasure, except maybe for the smile on Nathalie's face. She's the accountant. And René is in love with her. He can't find the words to express his feelings but he is convinced he can win her with his music, when he's ready. When Mr. Maurice retires, René's world is turned upside down. His new boss bullies him, his guitar hero dies, he fails to win Nathalie's heart. Only the Blues can pull him through. René takes on the appearance of his idol: his voice, his style and his mission. The sound of his guitar, his powerful raspy voice, his long silver hair and his Angel-like face make him a star for an imaginary audience. He's become Silver Head the great guitarist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1wr00kfb4ZGf5mGU3W1lUGcF58u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bluesbreaker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
