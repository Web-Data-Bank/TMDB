I know it’s not only me, because there are others out there…”  ‘I Don’t Protest, I Just Dance In My Shadow’ is a short visual essay film by artist animator, Jessica Ashman, about navigating the visual art and animation world as a black face in a white space.  Using animation and recorded interviews of eight other women of colour artists, ‘I Don’t Protest, I Just Dance In My Shadow’ is an abstract confessional from the director herself: a visualisation of the joy, frustration, wishes and dreams of what it feels like to be a black women and a woman of colour artist, creating and existing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uNQoAwrZWqbV1ZENt8I6gvoAxni.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of England","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":51715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animate Projects","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Don't Protest, I Just Dance in My Shadow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
