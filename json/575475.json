The film offers an intimate glance into De Keersmaeker’s meticulous methodology, in which a choreographic universe is built up through a careful study of musical composition. This intense creative process of continuously reshaping and honing, characterised by De Keersmaeker’s inexhaustible longing for precision and detail, is reflected in the filmmakers’ patient look at the work of the choreographer, the musician and dancers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hwV8Wnr2b77hpQQN5mdygRqAqbp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108344,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accattone Films","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2019-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mitten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
