The Circle would begin where the band started out, in Sydneyâ€™s pubs, then circumnavigate the globe. It was to be their first tour in over 15 years.  And so, after 77 performances to over a half million people around the world, this is where The Great Circle Tour would finally come to a close in Sidney. Two hometown shows in this special place: The Domain. The first date? November 11. Known to some as Armistice Day.
