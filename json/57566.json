Known as the BBC, the story involves a couple of guys recruited into Hunt's company on the promise of making millions. However, every time Hunt's lapdogs think his boss has used his cleverness to make them filthy rich, they instead find themselves with financial losses. Trying to recoup a mounting pile of debt made from giant b.s. deals, the ruthless Hunt involves select members of the BBC to aid in the worst of crimes to get what they want. But a few, scared of how far Hunt will go, try to stop Hunt's brutal reign of terror possibly before real damage begins.","popularity":1.897,"poster_path":"/hLaGDdPhc9kc7rkYjKrGVp68mxp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87413,"logo_path":null,"name":"Donald March Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":35816,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gross-Weston Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1155,"logo_path":"/rKTzFu5woCo8k0u9ML7mWeLY541.png","name":"ITC Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1502,"logo_path":"/ywjcvHUiKxv7cYsestkONF8LieH.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":184,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Young, Rich, and Out of Control","title":"Billionaire Boys Club","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":8}
