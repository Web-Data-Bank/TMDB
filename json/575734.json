This is a home movie domestic comedy experimental film drama. Autobiography too. It’s also part four of an ever-growing trilogy.  Starting in 2003 I decided to make a series of pieces alongside my regular films, a strand that would constitute an ongoing fictional autobiography. But as all creative work is, to some extent, autobiographical, and as I appear in most of my films, and all the people in these films are who they say they are, then what made this different from the rest – or from real life, really – became kind of blurred. Fuzzy even.  So this is fuzzy fiction – latest in the line.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ulUp7yz2uuOu7SywG04YDjfZJMj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Popular Touch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
