It's the early 1960's, and while Americans and Russians are racing to be the first in outer space, the people who live in a small town can't contain their fascination with the exploration of the cosmos. School children draw pictures of the moon, a repairman thinks he's found evidence of alien life forms, weekend painters develop a new perspective on the sky, kids get into the game by cobbling together a homemade spaceship, and a teacher obsessed with auto racing thinks he knows the secret behind some strange terrestrial events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/51pbm7xmkobg4vh1JyCrg4s0Viw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Faint Trembling of the Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
