A country that not long ago suffered daily power outages is engaged in a highly technological form of capitalism. What's more, much of this activity is concentrated in the rural, wine-growing region of Kakheti. In the countryside, cows graze amidst internet towers and are killed by machines; drones fly over vineyards; horse-drawn carriages travel on unpaved roads where electricity poles are being repaired and labour is performed by computers. The boundary between the natural and virtual is slowly being eradicated.","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/9ydH1neMLpvJrnWUsVRl5DHs5Ia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2019-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Harvest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
