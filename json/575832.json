In Si Fan (‘yearnings of love’), Guo combines traditional opera from his native Sichuan with his own music. \"I don’t think when composing, I follow my heart\", Guo says to Ed Spanjaard, head conductor of the Nieuw Ensemble, who comes to visit him in China to learn about the secrets of Sichuan opera. In this painstaking film, Shen Tiemei, the star singer of the Sichuan opera, speaks about the differences between East and West, and between tradition and the modern age.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lIXWvTqUXpS5iPrXBLkzkN8hON3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inner Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
