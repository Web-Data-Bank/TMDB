The film and an accompanying book formed his PhD thesis. But as so often with him, projects turn into obsessions – especially when there are masses of notions not pondered, thoughts not elaborated upon. And so KINORAMA - Beyond the Walls of Cinema was born, a stand-alone continuation of The Amazing Spectator that looks at cinema’s future in cyberspace and, accordingly, perhaps the end of its enslavement to figurative representation, the 'stupid sacred in narrative cinema' (to use a Pêra’ism), realism and artificiality in 3D cinema, and many other aspects.","popularity":0.883,"poster_path":"/Wiy9NkSCp8AhJxwLHdUZECWTNe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16464,"logo_path":"/iH0ZuDfP4IcZidBx6F8gY17DQ5u.png","name":"Bando à Parte","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":16701,"logo_path":null,"name":"ICA","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinorama: Beyond the Walls of the Real","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
