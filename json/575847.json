It's also a history of encounters and transmissions between generations. The film’s ambition is to transform our perception of the sounds of the world and incite us to think of them as music. Sounds surround and shape us even when we don’t pay attention to them. By recording them, we can appropriate them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/WPRCgxBjMQtUvnP00IFgOeI5zo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La lucarne des rêves","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
