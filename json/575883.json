A soldier comes back from the dead to a seaside village. He reminisces on the time lost while he was away, like a sea between his past and the dysfunctional present. Through him we discover a motley of characters: a rag-tag musical band, a man locked up inside an abandoned horse stable, his sister, also the soldier’s lover and who has been bemoaning the loss. An impressionistic view of the intertwined lives of those inhabiting imaginary spaces, with an underpinning of social and political metaphors.","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/zfiBYnfITeyNglf3Y5jMIOsiZdN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131381,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film and Television Institute of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sea of Lost Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
