Its libretto was by the author Ignaz Schnitzer (de) and in turn was based on Sáffi by Mór Jókai. During the composer's lifetime, the operetta enjoyed great success, second only to the popularity of Die Fledermaus. The scoring and the nature of Strauss's music have also led many music critics to consider this work a comic opera or a lyric opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dMCBruJFnxNqxCUSQ7oQAppnUqU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Zigeunerbaron","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
