The veil darkens and the tears mingle with the salt of the water. \"Pouca Sorte\" (Short Luck) is that of the fisherman that goes to the sea and brings the net empty, and is also the name of the boat of the Art Xávega's (fishing technique) companion in Praia da Tocha beach. A small fishing community that despite the modernization and conversion in tourist attraction, still conserves some traditions intact. This is their story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1h5uBAnCCek014L314177l3xrhW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Rebentação","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
