A world full of extravagances and colorful characters, but suggestive of the contrast it represents with the normal life of most people. An artificial, theatrical and equivocal world but inhabited by innocence and blind faith in the transforming power of art. The film is a tribute to this world and to these people, with ironic and often provocative borders, but sincere in their admiration for the subversive power of the artists who always question, and in the most unexpected (sometimes involuntary) way, our system of values.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/eG9wzgWiGcEDYpb2KZzhtrafYaX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Catal√†"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"I Am an Artist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
