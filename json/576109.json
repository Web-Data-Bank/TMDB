Her son, a young, clean-cut, college-bred man, like  other gilded youths, makes the acquaintance  of an actress and the inevitable follows. He marries her, much against the commands of  his mother. He neglects her for the companionship of a rather smart and fast set in society. The pace they set is rather strong, and after  weeks of gambling and dissipation, he finds  himself separated from his wife and position.  His wife, now burdened with a child, is forced to seek employment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solax Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Roads That Lead Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
