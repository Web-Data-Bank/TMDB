Through purely abstract, moving images, the corresponding emotional states are conveyed: calm, love, joy, surprise, fear, anger/hate, and death/rebirth leading again to calm. The cycles continue until the stars burn out and there is nothing left. Minotaur was created stereoscopically in IMAXÂ® Sandde (Stereoscopic ANimation Drawing Device) , the world's first freehand stereoscopic 3D animation software.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/4h0eyYYMd7bysq1NG8oRm8eGxNn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minotaur","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
