What’s left is the people themselves, in this edition it is Sean Waltman who bares his soul for all of you.  Waltman’s descent into drug addiction, pornography, childhood abuse, and a suicide attempt sets up an exploration of all that has been destroyed, and what can be salvaged. Waltman may be a tragic figure, but as Oliver attempts to achieve in the show, perhaps a tragic figure that can avert a wrestling legacy from being tarnished for good.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t2mVcm1tGxgiCsGEVlepSg0iwkm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breaking Kayfabe with Sean Waltman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
