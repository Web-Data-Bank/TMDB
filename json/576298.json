Featuring live actors and digital avatars, the story is about the last day of a blind poet, Max Starpower. The project is a universe where tragedy, sarcasm, and comedy are portrayed as a deformed and apocalyptic mirror of reality; In this world, circumstance is the source of tragedy, and the grimace produced by this tragedy is what rules its form.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cuIOG8eiG3fVnPrv7q5HcGma2gv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53568,"logo_path":null,"name":"3 Legged Dog Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Black Lights and One Red","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
