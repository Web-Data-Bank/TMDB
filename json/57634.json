Now, nearly 60 years later, a team of experts examines the original blueprints to determine if these so-called \"Wunderwaffen,\" or \"wonder weapons,\" could have changed the outcome of the war. One of Adolf Hitler's most top secret bombs: The Fritz X grandfather of the modern smart bomb. Prototype testing revealed that the success rate with this radio-guided bomb was over 80 times higher than with conventional free-falling bombs of the time.  In every documented case the destructive power of the Fritz X proved so strong that it would completely rip through any battleship it hit. It would never explode while still inside the ship, but on exiting or in the water.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1sZxufpMVbdN2DlHax5W2Q0zvx0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hitler's secret weapons of WW2","title":"Nazi Secret Weapons","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
