They developed some of the most sophisticated and advanced weaponry of the age - the so-called Wunderwaffen or Wonder Weapons. From missiles and enormous tanks, to the biggest gun ever built and the prototype of a plane capable of launching a suicide bombing raid on the skyscrapers of New York. Hitler's Secret Weapon shows how they helped the technology of war advance generations in little more than a decade. Using archive footage, reconstructions and interviews with experts, this fascinating show explores some of the many plans for outlandish and fantastic designs the Nazis hoped would win the war.
