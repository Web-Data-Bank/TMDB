Upon the witch granting the girl’s wish to become a young woman, this surrealist chronicle follows the precocious Camélia on a series of quests in pursuit of love. Niki de Saint Phalle’s sophomore film revels in the sexual decadence that defined the 1970s zeitgeist, showcasing scenes of debauched harems and totemic worship of phallic sculptures. An astounding piece of directorial bravery, UN RÊVE PLUS LONG QUE LA NUIT confirms Saint Phalle’s wicked yet earnest pleasure in excavating the underlying perversions at play within the romantic quiet of fairy tales.\" - Anthology Film Archives","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/esl2y92kqdsoDTLu6K10A40DPcL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dream Longer Than the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
