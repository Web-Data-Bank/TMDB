This is a documentary with soul; a salty blend of stories by the eclectic assortment of people sharing tales of adventure, adrenaline, inspiration, love and loss and their relationship with the ocean. Some are well-known like Hawaii's Pipeline and California's Mavericks and others are remote spots tucked high up in North West Australia and deep in South Australia. This film, underpinned by inspiring surfing, is also a love letter to the sea woven through with experiences from surfers, filmmakers, fishermen, marine scientists and watermen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/acg9RyRgPWKyWTBZoR3iP8Qnw2l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113696,"logo_path":null,"name":"harroart","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Surfer's Connection to the Sea","title":"Emocean","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
