The first of these moments takes place in 1958 when Mohammed Rafi was invited to Cochin to sing at my grandparents wedding. Along with a performance of his hit songs from the period, Rafi sang a song specially composed for the occasion. Recordings of this were made and eventually lost. The other event began in 2008 when my uncle Parvez founded a blog dedicated to the singer. After collecting and sharing information related to the singer and being active on various online forums around him, my uncle eventually deleted the blog in 2014.  In the absence of the records and the blog, the film sets out to trace the story around these two objects all the while reflecting on my family’s relationship to the various technological documents encountered in their homes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2bLko6Ou0npFDA1dKhoBxzPRDBy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mohammed Rafi Fan Blog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
