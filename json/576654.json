Closely following the compositions of Ray's original film, director Ann Oren presents printed frames from online videos in a stack directly below the cameraâ€”adding a single frame to the stack every few seconds. The unhurried process of stacking the images by hand slows the otherwise speedy consumption of pornographic media in a nod to Ray's preoccupation with the female body as sculpture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vbc4oPixLerQYoNZEs5AhUiv49I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deux femmes (for Man Ray)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
