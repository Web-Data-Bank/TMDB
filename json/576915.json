The museum’s weekly after school program of 8-11 year olds collaborated with a Pima Community College Border Cultures class and a Tucson High School Art Appreciationclass in the creation of an animated video work exploring the themes of borders, identity, and cross-cultural pollination. The youth and student participants contributed the visual, audio, and textual elements to this project. This project culminated in a public presentation of this animated video and its accompanying components at MOCA Tucson. This event showcased an experiment in collaboration across age groups that tackles the complex topics of border culture and politics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dGl4ROR2n50yf3HsgNZEtvPV7Qb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prototype","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
