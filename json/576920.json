Ice-covered rivers and canals of the capital seethe with festive activities. On the eve of the new century those who should not be destined to meet, come together. They are people from different worlds: Matvey, the son of a lamplighter, whose only treasure is his silver-plated skates; Alice is the daughter of a high-ranking official dreaming of science. Each of them has his own difficult life-story, but having accidentally met they rush forward together in pursuit of their dreams.","popularity":12.659,"poster_path":"/om51hNT54XocGVW3qONHXwMFBBW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99796,"logo_path":"/9mf2AFZUoQP4ovnNiSOg7SKJjZa.png","name":"KIT Film Studio","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":3467,"logo_path":"/pumbDNR4udEagb3ldNUMFSA85Fn.png","name":"Studio Trite","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":21179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinoslovo","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":106390,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gazprom-Media","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":76049,"logo_path":"/tam9pIV4QK1ZPwdxBgtVkK1WTYC.png","name":"Cinema Fund","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Magical Journey Awaits You!","title":"Silver Skates","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":208}
