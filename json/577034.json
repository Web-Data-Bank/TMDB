This Is My Last Film About You.","overview":"The wastelands and crowded streets of an African country are traversed by a woman bearing a wooden cross on her back. She is followed by sellers, beggars and passersby, outraged voices, pity and curious glances. Parallel to her, among a herd of sheep, a lamb toddles its way from the far away mountains into the heart of the city, only to find itself dangling, skinned and headless, on a butcher’s shoulder. In the meantime, under the scorching sun, in a roofless house, a woman is persistently knitting a garment, unwinding a thread coiled over her son’s face. ‘Mother, I Am Suffocating. This is My Last Film About You’ is a symbolic social-political voyage of a society, spiralling between religion, identity and collective memory. “I saw in you what they saw, mother. You deserve your war”.","popularity":0.678,"poster_path":"/gLzhfHM4ao65BtzwpYm2ciuit2T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8152,"logo_path":"/shnLD1Pj9d1vB2TH93QHSNT5gzW.png","name":"DFI","origin_country":"QA"},{"id":113805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mokoari Street","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LS","name":"Lesotho"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2019-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sotho","iso_639_1":"st","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother, I Am Suffocating.
