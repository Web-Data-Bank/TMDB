A work which frees itself from classical film dogma in order to become a space that is open and thus reserved for the liberty of the imagination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1IiJdloEZMyHsKfiZBtrKZz2TaQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uaoen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
