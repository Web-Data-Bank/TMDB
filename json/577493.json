For music of such complexity and intensity, the brevity of this opera is just right; you could take it as five hours of Verdi or Wagner concentrated and crystalized in one hour of Schoenberg.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/4GU3HVZafwf6HfrxwUIf0iXigVo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schoenberg: Heute Morgen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
