The production is simple and straightforward, the conducting of the modest orchestra shows a sure touch of the Verdi style. Picture and sound are fine. Above all, the singing delivers full value of the score.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v6KIC5q9ZaHWncpq0YFV82nnHly.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdi: I Due Foscari","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
