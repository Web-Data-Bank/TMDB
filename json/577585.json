Here she presents us the relfections of a young woman on her balcony shaking her laundry. The private thoughts of this woman are drowned in her own delirium which is accentuated and framed in by film’s repetitive imagery. The camera slowly zooms out to reveal the urban decor in which the film was made. The anonymous facades of the surrounding apartment blocks pushes us to imagine that behind each one of these buildings hides a collection of unique lifestyles and thoughts. The artist brings this to light through a strange and almost sad sense of humor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jdXv3BjA6uexZBvyb7i4AtqOANZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Your Clothes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
