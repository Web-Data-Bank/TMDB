These stories begin in 1531 with the arrival of explorer Francisco Pizarro, under the direction of King Charles V of Spain, Pizarro who is in search of the gold associated with the legendary El Dorado. Pizarro holds captive the Emperor of the Incas, Atahualpa, to discover the location of the gold. Atahualpa, in turn, promises a cave full of gold for his release. Receiving some gold, Pizarro, not trusting Atahualpa, murders him without ever finding the location of the gold, thought to be twenty thousand shiploads full, worth, in today dollars, in the billions. Legend now has it that the Incas have placed a curse on the gold to avenge Atahualpa's murder, the several attempts by outsiders to locate it leading to tragedy.
