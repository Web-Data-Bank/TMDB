Boris Godunov is Mussorgsky’s masterpiece and his only complete opera. It’s a vast sprawling tapestry of Russian life, which centres on the Russian people – represented in the opera by a large and powerful chorus – rather than on the title figure. The staging was produced at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona and is based on the original version of the score.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ZznGm1ZjUK8bonqPQTCK1FashF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gran Teatre del Liceu","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boris Godunov","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
