In November, 2007, thirteen opera lovers from Michael Tisma’s Ovations International opera tour travelled to Teatro Municipale Valli in Emiglia Romana to see Bologna’s production of Boccanegra. Without exception, everyone considered it an emotionally gripping performance of Verdi’s pessimistic tale of spiritual disturbance and foreboding. What is evident while watching the DVD is the difference between the confident execution and polish of the Teatro Valli performance and the unfinished, yet promising rendition caught at the opera’s prima in Bologna.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mbocmAh5Wn6QgSmPCqLo5lvk9Bf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simon Boccanegra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
