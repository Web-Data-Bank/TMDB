In 1975 Yuri Grigorovich, for thirty years the chief choreographer of Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet, made a ballet on the same subject and used a conflation of Prokofiev's music from the film. It was quickly taken up by ballet companies the world over. This DVD is a film of a performance recorded live at the Op√©ra National de Paris in December 2003 and featuring three premier dancers of that company in the solo roles of Ivan, Anastasia and Kurbsky. The stage is filled at times with as many as eighty dancers as boyars, oprichniks (Ivan's personal police, assassins actually), maidens from whom Ivan picks his bride, and 'the Russian people.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lmmaKxzUAnFjYm9VTKrTGW1PtmD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ivan The Terrible","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
