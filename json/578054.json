Lik receives a letter from Sui with the wonderful news that she is pregnant. Lik is outraged, as he has just been told he is sterile. Lik first plans to secretly return home and kill Sui, then he suspects his best pal Mo Mo, so he decides to do them both in. To further complicate matters, an airheaded pregnant mainlander named Baby shows up and moves in. She claims Lik is her man. Lik's efforts to remain hidden and carry out his plans are frustrated by a local madman who follows him around. Questions arise. Could Mo Mo really be the father ? Though a dispirited cripple, Mo Mo has secretly been in love with Sui for over a decade and, given the turn of events, this could be the time to tell her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m6hG9we1a2DrlmZIXDZXdLybzxy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seven mm Film Production Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weakness of Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
