Men, women, and children, animals and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 years ago, such a child survived the Death Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xxcW1A7Cd31IgO9o1q3KdZX77Nj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10038,"logo_path":"/nCueXKwYIEXrZ5ofqSJBO1YcmRr.png","name":"SQUARE ENIX","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":114009,"logo_path":null,"name":"30-DELUX","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":158,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romancing SaGa THE STAGE ~The Day Roanu Burned~","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
