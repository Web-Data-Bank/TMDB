Mike, Bill, and Kevin riffed this cult classic low-budget space opera live in Nashville. Now you can watch the show from the comfort of your own home, or space golf cart, if you have one of those.  This is the Big McLargeHugest show you'll ever own. It's a brand new riff, completely different from the original MST3K episode. The show stars with a live riffing of The Magic Shop, a hilariously weird short that's somehow based on a story by H.G. Wells. Also included: pre-show slides and more bonus material! Also also included: Kevin wearing a shiny space muumuu you won't soon forget.","popularity":0.66,"poster_path":"/hhjrqmFvPuFfhBdCCs7gWciVqVs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rifftrax Live: Space Mutiny","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
