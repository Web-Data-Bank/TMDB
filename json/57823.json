After the two boys steal a car and get into an accident, with the adolescent daughter of a Hamburg Senator sitting in the passenger seat, the two scoundrels are packed up and sent to a boot camp. This military-style camp is run by Axel and Henry, two former East German soldiers who still strongly believe in Communism but are secretly gay lovers. Max and Moritz steal another car...a red Ferrari owned by small-town pimp Murder-Hanne. The nationalistic sadist teaches the boys a painful lesson, but Max and Moritz wouldn’t be Max and Moritz if they let this weekend-fascist get them down... and when they acquire the key to their military school’s ordinance depot, things start to change.","popularity":1.039,"poster_path":"/qLiuBPsIinmqSSkknknFzLOIjn5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10272,"logo_path":"/vk5pSZy5HmQFG9cdJSEF8XC2AEG.png","name":"Starhaus Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":138748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max and Moritz Reloaded","video":false,"vote_average":2.4,"vote_count":9}
