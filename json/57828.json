Vaughan, standing at center stage, launches into \"Six Strings Down,\" A moving tribute to his late brother, Stevie Ray, whose memory has drawn this group together. The guitarists fall in, each finding a corner of the song to call their own; King plays fills to Clapton's solo, Cray fires off economical, chiming counterpoint to Raitt's stinging slide, and Guy unleashes piercing single-notes bends to answer Vaughan, who's finger-picking the main theme on his battered Stratocaster. Suddenly, the song blasts into the stratosphere, a gorgeous mosaic of clarion guitar tones.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/d5CSXRRUBahnLfKWrdnP0bthxnt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan by talented artists.","title":"A Tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
