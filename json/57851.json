At the time, it was to be Osbourne's final album following Osbourne's final tour before retiring, aptly titled \"No More Tours\". The track \"Black Sabbath\" featured the original line-up of Black Sabbath, the members of which were invited to join Ozzy as guest stars for the Costa Mesa Reunion shows.  A DVD of Live & Loud was also issued, one of the very first music compilation released in that format. The DVD is a compilation of live footage from several shows rather than a single concert: this is evident as Osbourne can be seen both shirtless and wearing different clothes during the same song, while guitarist Zakk Wylde can be seen playing up to three different guitars in the same song.[2]","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/bVHJi060Ljgp1BxoNWXVoDwGBKn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4375,"logo_path":"/eo8fJbkpiz9Wdsl1qDSEX4GXeZH.png","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ozzy in concert","title":"Ozzy Osbourne: Live & Loud","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
