Together, they get rid of every obstacle in their way: his wife, her former lover, and also the voice of reason. Everything is sacrificed to passion, in this tale where evil triumphs, virtue and reason are humiliated, and nothing corresponds to our moral principles.  Jan Lauwers, the director and choreographer, sets L'incoronazione di Poppea in a way congenial to his means: a visual artist, he translated the emotions expressed by Monteverdiâ€™s music into dancing and visual images. The result was mixed; the general impression was one of many ideas, seemingly not fully developed or analysed. The stage was constantly cluttered with moving bodies, or tableau vivants, leaving a sense of confusion, and distracting from the music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Incoronazione di Poppea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
