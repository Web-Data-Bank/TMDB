Here, they listen to spiders, discover black holes, and fight about what is going to steer a flying carpet. Together they search for the answers to life's big questions. But the brutality of the adult world makes itself known when terrorists detonate a bomb in the neighborhood. Aaatos envies Amine's Muslim faith and looks for his own gods, although his classmate Flo questions him; she is strongly convinced that anyone who believes in God is completely nuts. Gods of Molenbeek is a wonderful portrayal of childhood friendship, inquiry and the creation of meaning in a chaotic time.","popularity":0.638,"poster_path":"/4QFwXz04kVeaQc3M8Z1E22vPmNu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94771,"logo_path":"/e9TrCyThYq5qIs4OGkMQF40HDzX.png","name":"Zone2 Pictures","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2019-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I don't know if I know","title":"Gods of Molenbeek","video":false,"vote_average":7.143,"vote_count":7}
