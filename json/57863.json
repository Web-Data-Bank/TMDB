Boom times have come to the oil-rich town. So has a new breed of criminal. You Know My Name is the fact-based story of Bill Tilghman, a lawman and former partner of Wyatt Earp confronted by an emerging era when outlaws run whiskey instead of cattle and are likely to tote a tommy gun as carry a six-gun. An ideally cast Sam Elliott plays Tilghman, whose life takes on a newfangled wrinkle of its own. Tilghman makes a moving picture of his Old West exploits; and the success of that silent film, The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws, spreads his reputation like a brushfire. But that reputation may mean nothing to a thug (Arliss Howard) who hides behind a badge.","popularity":1.86,"poster_path":"/1qgIAlssWJbqvyMoBctlxx5mZye.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55847,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ancient Mariner Films","origin_country":""},{"id":678,"logo_path":"/AbIc38dGx4b8dhKS7oeRL6aXFDv.png","name":"Turner Network Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"America's Last Great Lawman Takes On A New Kind Of Outlaw.","title":"You Know My Name","video":false,"vote_average":3.929,"vote_count":7}
