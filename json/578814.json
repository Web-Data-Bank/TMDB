This reunion is their ﬁrst meeting in many years, triggered by Giuliano’s failing health and his decision to forgo treatment. Instead he is focussed on putting his affairs in order: distributing possessions, reconciling past disputes, and, most importantly, ﬁnding a home for his beloved canine, Pato. Over four days, the two men walk the streets of Rome, visiting bookshops, restaurants, veterinarians and friends, examining their lives and speculating on what the future holds.","popularity":4.432,"poster_path":"/zh2mFtZ6HJoZYcdyjfs17GHm8Qw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baires Produzioni","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":6246,"logo_path":"/7X6pfxldTiOD7MLo2EQqUQlmOUw.png","name":"Medusa Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":21649,"logo_path":"/6Ji6E59Wt9O4VA6nqwAd6RW7ijs.png","name":"Sky Cinema","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomorrow's a New Day","video":false,"vote_average":6.887,"vote_count":204}
