The series are transforming and spiritualizing human body by the use of light, or more precisely by the screening of a film directly to the skin. The body is therefore the only screen for the abstract images made from mathematical models. This encounter between body and light produces a particular and creative energy beyond shapes. Lyrical abstraction, mathematical modelisation and sensual exploration of light, this film is the depth perception of the body stridences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2kbo8efPatlGtxAxfehBnNr4TYn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aldébaran","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
