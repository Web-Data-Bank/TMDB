Chris Everard presents what can only be described as the most startling UFO footage ever seen. The Space Serpents flying around the upper atmosphere have to be seen to be believed. What's more, is that all the UFO clips come direct from NASA - filmed by astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle! I must admit that I originally thought the premise for this film was ridiculous.

Colonel Philip Corso was right. They're Here!\"","popularity":0.825,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Space I: The Illuminati's Conquest of Space","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
