A chorus of male voices answers her from the castle stair: «We love you». A monotonous yet grotesque litany is created, that acquires a rather neurotic note in being so repetitious. Reduction to two camera settings, which strictly track the two axes of the Baroque interior, enhances the impression. The prologue is a sequence in which a child, also in court dress, leads the viewer into this absurd scenario. In the end banality breaks into the artificially generated tension as ironic relief.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schloss Solitude","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
