It is a gripping story of defiance against the brute force of the Nazi war machine that came to reflect Britain's attitude of grit and determination in the face of adversity. This unique DVD provides a blow-by-blow account of the desperately close-run conflict that was the death or glory battle fought in the skies over England. It also tells the story of the Blitz when Hitler, having failed to destroy the threat of the RAF, tried to bomb Britain into submission. It was a ghastly few months when London was attacked on 57 consecutive nights and 15 other cities suffered extensive damage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle Of Britain","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
