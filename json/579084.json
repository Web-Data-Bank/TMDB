Devastated by an epidemic of addiction, Houston faced the reality of burying and locking up its young people at an alarming rate. And so in one of the largest cities in America, visionary counselors, law school dropouts, aspiring rock musicians, retired football players, oil industry executives, and church leaders came together to build the world's largest peer-driven youth and family recovery community. Independently filmed over the course of two years, Generation Found takes an unprecedented and intimate look at how a system of treatment centers, sober high schools, alternative peer groups, and collegiate recovery programs can exist in concert to intervene early and provide a real and tested long-term alternative to the \"War on Drugs.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nCiaEGgmjeDPFcFXnEagb7JVcWY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Generation Found","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
