Harry (Helmuth) is a simple old-time shop porter offered a chance at self-realisation when he's bequeathed a sum by an unknown relative (via several levels of fiscal blood suckers). He decides to engage a butler to take good care of him for a time. This is a man of distinguished upper class service, but a generous nature which happily integrates with Harry's small but colourful world of drinking buddies and crackpot neighbourhood kids.","popularity":0.773,"poster_path":"/hwZWFyXsEy7jGGTcemuuutIT1Vf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bent Christensen Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1961-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harry and the Butler","video":false,"vote_average":6.893,"vote_count":14}
