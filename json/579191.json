A woman, misjudged and concealed, rocks the art world with her mind-blowing oeuvre. Hilma af Klint was a pioneer creating her first abstract painting in 1906, four years before Vassily Kandinsky. But why was she ignored? Why are her paintings not available on the market? This first film on her is about her life and work, the role of women in art history and the discovery of an art scandal. Her quest for meaning in life and a boundless thinking led into a timeless, outstanding oeuvre.","popularity":2.271,"poster_path":"/fOAQ5DkJHt2nwM0bVleF0uQKcyX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond The Visible - Hilma af Klint","video":false,"vote_average":7.136,"vote_count":11}
