Their search for help only gets them lost, deep in the woods, where they meet Forest Ranger Bill with a penchant for scary stories. The campfire flickers long into the night as the ranger uses words to weave his tapestry of terror, filling their young minds with a host of horrific images that will be burned into your consciousness long after the fire's last embers have gone out. Insane doctors, Indian ghosts, bad drugs, a deranged handyman with shiny new shears - all that and more awaits anyone brave enough to stay until sunrise... if you live that long!\r - Written by Schleppy","popularity":1.589,"poster_path":"/wTQQoXb2KxgxHJGM4c0vQDvsvQl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gather round the fire... for the last night of your life.","title":"Campfire Stories","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":6}
