Directed by former high court judge Sir Nick Stadlen, the film follows the 10 leading opponents of apartheid and their lawyers and supporters through the trial. It is an inspiring story of immense courage and self-sacrifice on the part of a small group of multiracial idealists.  Though the defendants were saved from the death penalty, eight of the ten were sentenced to life imprisonment, Mandela among them. When Mandela was released 27 years later, he had a vision of multiracial democracy for South Africa.","popularity":1.129,"poster_path":"/jmG3ICTIhrejLwNUYtwzdBsxdPF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Knickerbockerglory TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Is Wonderful: Mandela’s Unsung Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
