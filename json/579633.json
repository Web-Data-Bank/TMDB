The 400 year-old store owner had begun to face some difficult times. Upholding quality, craftsmanship, a dwindling demand for Kyo-Ningyo had culminated into difficulty running a retail space while maintaining the same level of commitment. Eventually the store owner’s decision to close his store had a profound and introspective effect on visvim founder Hiroki Nakamura which led to the creation of this film.  The multi-region DVD is available at F.I.L. stores across Japan and Asia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nc6Gu2THocT3kFAUYh3gHoFldqg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suitman Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cycle of Craftsmanship","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
