The police have publicly said that they are struggling to tackle the increase in online child sex predators. The hunters say they are trying to help tackle the threat. While some of the evidence that the hunters gather is used in some cases to charge suspects, the police are concerned about people being wrongly targeted and hurt. As well as some groups naming and shaming people online before police can assess any evidence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p61OMwgSpmJVZe7pgM1p0OsMotN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paedophile Hunters: The Rise Of The Vigilantes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
