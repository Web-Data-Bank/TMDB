Jamalutdin went down in history as a \"great hostage\", and the film is an attempt to answer the question: a hostage of big politics or big love. The historical context of the decline of the Nikolaev era, against which the story of love and betrayal, honor and duty, service to the motherland and loyalty to this word unfolds, will become the key to the film.","popularity":0.857,"poster_path":"/4xcwIJzhYVsttdSIkRCOiPKRp0C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dagger Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amanat","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":3}
