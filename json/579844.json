Machine-gun crew of Hanpasha Nuradilov destroyed almost a thousand soldiers and officers of the enemy in an unequal battle, showing an example of selfless courage and heroism. With his sacrifice, Nuradilov stopped the powerful attack of the Germans, thereby giving time to regroup the Soviet troops, and did not allow the enemy to capture the Serafimovichi bridgehead, which gathered the main forces of our army for the main attack on the Wehrmacht group in Stalingrad.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cDlC8PEIjHO9Rqs7wuK0oOGcjDl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dagger Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Height 220","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
