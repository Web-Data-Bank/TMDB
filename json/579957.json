Born in Mineville, New York in 1936, Robert's childhood was an endless cycle of unimaginable horror. Beatings, sexual abuse, bestiality and bloodshed. As an adult, Robert would become a sadomasochist, rapist and serial killer. The exact number of his victims to this day remains uncertain. A knife wielding psychopath that could charm his victims before carving them to death. Robert was clever and cunning. He was able to manipulate the law, fake his own paralysis, escape from prison, and avoid capture for over a decade.  â€”Lori Kelly - Bailey","popularity":0.605,"poster_path":"/740sdyT6lLtw8dplyY02ilMgmwZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on Horrifying True Events","title":"Garrow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
