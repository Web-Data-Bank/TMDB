A voice, enigmatic and sometimes uncertain, foretells of, relates and recalls the routine processes of injustice and their legacy: the creation of a diaspora of household objects, scattered amongst buildings that no longer exist. As the camera probes the secrets of ordinary spaces, streets and buildings around the city of Berlin, semblances of a person and a history begin to emerge and coalesce.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/svNirhKw38H7dru9oflsYQpEMHu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Parts of a Folding Screen","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":3}
