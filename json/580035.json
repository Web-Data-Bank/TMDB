It is a poetic essay in repoliticising one of the most universal colours, which also has colonial references. Objects and documents are rendered in words by the Afro-American poet Kain, voiced in music improvised by drummer Lander Gyselinck and animated in images by Vincent Meessen. Ultramarine is composed like a spectrum: it unfolds and intertwines fragments of meaning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dQ4XoIOn0kWIRKV2jQhtoXT4rUf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultramarine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
