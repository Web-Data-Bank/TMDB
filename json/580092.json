DIE GEKREUZIGT WERDEN (The Forsaken Jew) was presumed lost for a long time. The present fragment is based on a screening copy that was in a serious state of decomposition. It was discovered by Filmarchiv Austria and extensively restored. The film tells the story of a tormented man, exposed to ridicule and racism.
