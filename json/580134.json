Hendrik wants to find out more about this mysterious man who doesn't want to reveal anything personal despite his ambitions to fully expose himself online. Bluefrog agrees to take part in this film and to also become the director of a real porn scene. However, both, director and protagonist, have a different film in mind. In addition, creating the porn scene is not as playful as it looks online. NSFW is the result of a rather unique encounter in which fantasy and reality seem to clash. The film questions online privacy and the exhibitionist zeitgeist of today.","popularity":0.625,"poster_path":"/dQzRQkbo35tkev2V8p8VH15XsoT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NSFW: Seducing Mr. Bluefrog","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
