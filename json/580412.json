Two of them used to date ten years ago. The story is told through an interviewer and interviewees. Past stories are unearthed and overlap with the present, leading to a new story that seems like something totally different from what it started from. When they start playing Truth or Dare, secrets are revealed, yet it is uncertain whether they are real or merely lies. Their secrets, told amidst an atmosphere filled with destruction, death, and hope, are sarcastic, ridiculous, nonsensical, obsessed, and severely painful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d115U2QSSDNsI2JXUU6uLIV7xUM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jürgen Brüning Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2015-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"sPACEtIME","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
