She is also a mother drawing her two children with her into this death-in-life. Edge is the irony, which is the poet’s defiance. And it is the blade … how far can those controllers go with their instruments and armaments and still act as though our pieces and feelings can be stuck together again? There is no illusion of the woman’s ‘resistance’. Yet in this theme of woman as medical and war guinea-pig the silent scream becomes audible in lines of poetry and song.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ucYH9d9O5kzMSvWgxE2yvYZB312.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
