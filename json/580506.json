The dream of restoring the countryside to the way it was during the first independence is only now seen by most as naïve and unreal. Six episodes that reflect the historical development in the nation parallel to the fate of the director’s mother are used to explore the effects of political order on everyday lives. Though she is now leaving the countryside, the process of moving her life provides a visual stimulus for memories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/olQfCyk0tLPxHBjciJrBCXmGmdA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":143449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bivrost Film \u0026 TV","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2008-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Mother's Farm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
