That was before he took an ice cream freighter to France in the late 40s, met and worked with the American born princess who published the world famous literary journal Botteghe Oscure, helped found the Paris Review and acted in the films of Federico Fellini while translating most of the latter's screenplays into English. Along the way he won the Lippincott Prize for first novelists, a Sewanee Review Fellowship in poetry, and became the epicenter of the expatriate community in Rome, where his parties were legendary. Not bad for someone who barely graduated high school and never had a bank account.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qh9CVftdfl2v0yt70fxvClPTfL9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eugene Walter: Last of the Bohemians","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
