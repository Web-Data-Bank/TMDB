The film goes on to document civil disobedience same-sex marriages and demonstrations across New York State, the Nyack Ten legal suit against New York state and the first day of legal same-sex marriages in Boston Massachusetts in May 2004. \"One Summer in New Paltz\", probes into the debate on same-sex marriage examining the intersection of same-sex marriage, war, the Constitution, race and the family. A strong work about grass roots organizing, straight/gay alliances and confrontation with state repression.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tSTTTeoKkBKAAIJOwV3W1VQr2R1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Summer in New Paltz: A Cautionary Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
