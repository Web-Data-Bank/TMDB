My ambition was to try and capture some of the town’s psyche and a little bit of its’ geography. To this end I was aided by the photographer Sebastian Edge, his ancient wet collodion photographic techniques, a mobile dark room and his assistant Gloria Lin. I documented the making of a series of photographs that managed to capture a sense of ‘place’. Ever alert to the spirit of ‘timesgone’ I have edited sounds and images that evoke a somewhat off-kilter reading of all things Rochellaises.\" – Andrew Kötting","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Rochelle est une ville","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
