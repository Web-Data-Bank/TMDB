The Dead Sea borders Jordan, Palestine’s West Bank and Israel. It constitutes the lowest place on earth and known for its therapeutic high sodium and mineral rich waters. Despite its name, the Dead Sea basin is a host to many wildlife species and is superb for farming. Unfortunately, due to the diversion of water from the Jordan River and mass mineral extraction though evaporation pools, the Dead Sea’s water reduction currently measures at 1.3m annually. Turning the lens on sites of existing and abandoned infrastructure, marking the lake’s current and former receded shores, Eulogy seeks to explore the potential for unifying international conflicts and examine alternatives for commerce and conservation through the lens of ecology and environmental responsibility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/13muNUtu6tP1OUSLMHiyst1zyzb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eulogy for the Dead Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
