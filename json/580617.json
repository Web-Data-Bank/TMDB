This road movie captures with humor, poetry and spirit the cultural differences between China and Europe in a play of mirrors and contrasts. It also destroys the stereotypes about the emerging Chinese middle class and reveals what they think about the \"others\" who are \"us\", the Westerners.","popularity":0.846,"poster_path":"/dNxSkjMWn3WcdBKYthNbPoa8i3q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey to the West","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
