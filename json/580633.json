An isolated lodge somewhere in England. Five old university pals, now nudging 40, gather for a weekend to scatter the ashes of their friend, Jonesy, who drowned himself in the lake three years earlier. They settle in for a fun evening, entertaining each other with stories of murders, ghosts, zombies and possessions, but as day turns to night, the gang become aware of another horror story unfolding around them - And this one is real.","popularity":3.251,"poster_path":"/xUV4i4tRegc6smwXOFk1ZnMgOvq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales from the Lodge","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":19}
