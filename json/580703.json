Produced by 311 and Wayne Price (Heartworn Highways Revisited), edited by Brandon “B Love” Hardin and mixed in 5.1 surround by Emmy-winner Tom Paul (Paul Simon’s Under African Skies),  Enlarged To Show Detail 3 (ETSD3) was designed to illustrate and solidify the indelible relationship between 311 and their fans.  In addition to live footage, ETSD3 features equally as much off-stage moments, including poignant interviews with band members and their fans,  behind-the-scenes clips, and revealing footage from the road, the studio and the musician’s homes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"311 Enlarged to Show Detail 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
