The success of Kenny's first appearance led to an invitation to return the following year, when he included a track from his then yet to be released album \"Silhouette\" in the set. This DVD features the whole of the 1987 show and selected tracks from 1988 and captures Kenny G just as he was breaking through to global stardom.
