Maxin and his friends spy on the amused Joe even when he’s bathing. One day, Maxin gets word that Joe is holding a contest (a really ludicrous, albeit campy one involving “long hair” and money) and whoever wins gets to spend a night with Joe. But a gang war erupts and Joe finds himself running for cover – straight into Maxin’s house. Will Maxin find the courage to speak his mind? Will Joe be the accommodating Romeo?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vCy51ZXFxZOPaSt68pwZtkg1XXc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swerte Ni Maxin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
