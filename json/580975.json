Goodnight, Irene\r Jack’s performance from the Wendy Williamson Auditorium in Anchorage, Alaska is a gem in its own right. With the ethereal setting adding to the mystique of the circumstance, the show was one of the most thrilling in White’s twenty-plus-year career, and those who were there to enjoy it (who had waited all day in the snow), bore witness to a once-in-a-lifetime performance. We present that memorable show here, in its entirety, on DVD, with expertly engineered sound and editing by TMR’s in-house film guru Brad Holland. Acoustic in Alaska is truly spectacular.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4vNbsNAWtoX0ZuMEDIqMJUZLl2f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51083,"logo_path":"/8QBMjrhxiXcZ9J0QmXUHK9s8euF.png","name":"Third Man Records","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jack White: Acoustic in Alaska","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
