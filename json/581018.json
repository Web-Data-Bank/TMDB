It is based on childhood memories of a renowned Mozambican artist Fiel dos Santos who grew up during the 16-year civil war – another proxy war sustained by conflicting foreign powers. Fiel created eight figures representing his father, mother, five brothers and sister from decommissioned AK-47s. Three New York artists turned them into puppets and animated. Little Fiel tells a universal story of peaceful people who have been coerced, conscripted and enticed into killing each other. It is our desperate act of hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fGwJFzrhVnzqfBApzFZRyRBXRqn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Fiel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
