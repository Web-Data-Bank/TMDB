Children become adolescents: how do they react to this development? With the help of four different short films, the Brit Roger Lambert succeeds in wonderfully fathoming this important time. In \"Split\" (1974), a boy with behavioral difficulties tries to make life bearable with imaginary aliens. In \"I Want To Be Famous\" (1976), it's Steve, the youngest and smallest in his class, who creates a fantasy world for himself until his best friend Stuart, down-to-earth and clever, forces him to face reality. \"Follow You Follow Me\" (1979) observes the vulnerable friendship between two boys: shy Joseph and confident Peter. But Joseph's father is Peter's father's employer. With \"A Seaside Story\" (1986) we meet again two friends, this time they are seventeen, who are vacationing together at the sea: the self-confident Martin and Sam, the dreamer. At a beachfront guesthouse run by an eccentric lady, the two have an unforgettable time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8qU9vBUOFDXO0ulgsVdqnRp30Xv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189446,"logo_path":null,"name":"CMV Laser Vision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coming of Age: Vol. 6 - The Roger Lambert Anthology","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
