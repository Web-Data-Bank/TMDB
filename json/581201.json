Yet, if it arrives, you better make room for it. Consumed by the guilt, Miguel (Alejandría Cinque) was doing his best to keep Evaristo (Cachorro Lozano) safe and apart of the tension, but he knew he couldn’t hide it any longer when dark thoughts started taking on his dreams. Seeking the mystic help of a pendulum, both lovers enter a dangerous game of questions that will reveal the most undesirable intimacy. In the time of day, they’ll go together through the fear of the illness, the subtle loss of the innocence, and the unparalleled complicity that arises from deep truth.","popularity":4.06,"poster_path":"/1OC9TlwrTdcjkwR9zbNYfKTbxKp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noel Alejandro Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It is an adult short-film and a real life story about love, guilt and loss of innocence that blossoms.","title":"Serodiscordantes","video":true,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
