Today he is gay and proud of it, involved in the fight against Aids, pro-choice sympathizer and even Sister of Perpetual Indulgence (a movement of gay activists dressing up as nuns classified as heretical by Pope John Paul II). After a confusing beginning, the film plunges you into the heart of a long and passionate confession during which Sister Innocenta comes back on these years of extreme right-wing militancy to finally open up and assume herself as a gay man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aeauIIuy7ZolAz598MkCBDYHLgx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soeur Innocenta, priez pour nous!","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2}
