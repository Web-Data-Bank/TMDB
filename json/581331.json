CAIRO IN ONE BREATH follows five muezzins as this Adhan Unification Project takes hold and as Egypt undergoes Revolution and regime change. The story follows five muezzins from when they first heard rumors of plans to install wireless receivers in Cairo's 4,000 officially recognized mosques, through implementation of this Adhan Unification Project (AUP), which since 2010 has displaced thousands. Now, most mosques have receivers installed, though political changes have halted inspection and maintenance. Former muezzins who now perform other duties at mosques, recite the adhan when receivers (all-to-frequently) fail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cairo in One Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
