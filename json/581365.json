That is the question that Guglielmo and Ferrando ask themselves in Mozart’s comic opera Così Fan Tutte. To answer it, they put their fiancées to the test by pretending to go off to war and a short time later returning in disguise with the aim of seducing each other’s betrothed.  Fortunately, the Opèra de Lausanne has no time for such moral grandstanding. This new staging of Così is Jean Liermier’s second production for Lausanne after his My Fair Lady in 2015. Joshua Weilerstein, artistic director of the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne, pilots the orchestra through Mozart’s colourful score with Stéphanie Guérin (Dorabella), Robert Gleadow (Guglielmo), Valentina Nafornita (Fiordiligi), and Joel Prieto (Ferrando) in the roles of the tried and tested lovers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1PrfU7XzZVHWgyHJ6V8VYEy8Tjn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Così Fan Tutte - Opéra de Lausanne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
