But two cousins team up with the village grannies to cultivate the tomato seeds they have kept for hundreds of years. With a little help from Wagner’s music –which they use to help their tomatoes grow– the team succeeds to export little jars with organic tomato recipes across the world. The film follows the protagonists of this unlikely quest, as they struggle to survive and make their dream come true. Humorous and bittersweet, this is a story about the importance of reinventing oneself in times of crisis and the power of human relationships.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/HfYaNS14XSfLIpKKYblaw79FZA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13686,"logo_path":"/zOx44dqqwcnk16LhOGc9DBsAixu.png","name":"Anemon Productions","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2019-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Tomatoes Met Wagner","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
