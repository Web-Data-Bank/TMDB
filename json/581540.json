Through first-person footage of four audacious riders, and interviews with critics and fans, Beyond Naked explores our deep-rooted fear and awkward fascination with nakedness.  Filmmakers Dan McComb and Lisa Cooper follow the four riders in the run up to the parade, uncovering their trepidations about, and motivations for riding naked. From nudist camp, to waxing spa, to the streets of Seattle’s quirky neighborhood called Fremont, audiences will experience the tensions and silliness at that arise at the intersection of public and private. Tastefully shot for a mainstream audience, the film will leave viewers inspired by the creative courage of those who are willing to dare more with less.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k2SucWT7eO0bsdMMs6etzxxDtQ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Naked","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
