The name came into official use in 1775 when the region was annexed from the Principality of Moldavia by the Habsburg Monarchy and then controlled by the Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary. But over the centuries, the region has also been subjugated by the Romans, Goths, Turks, Nazis, Russians, and others, and now is split between Northern Romania and Southern Ukraine. 'Souvenirs of Bucovina' is divided into two 80-minute acts which explore the history of the region, its enduring culture, the oppression of gypsies, the slaughtering of Jews in World War II, decades of Communist rule, and life since the democratic revolution of 1989.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1rmKdNFGsGva2P1GxQTCmIVjFiM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Souvenirs of Bucovina: A Romanian Survival Guide","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
