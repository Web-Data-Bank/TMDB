No high budget action, no pretenses, just the minimum needed to support the plot that takes the audience on a journey across various aspects of contemporary South African society, most often in a humorous way. Critics about car chases and special effects are completely missing the point of that movie. It mostly revolves about the culture shock of an educated black taking a plunge into Soweto gangster culture. I found the characters quite attaching and I felt refreshed after viewing this exotic piece. I recommend it if you are looking for a simple and out of the ordinary movie.","popularity":0.699,"poster_path":"/ovGt6JtNXGiOQqHP0dvWJ24hjDE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hijack Stories","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
