In search of one of the sixties' most astonishing voices, adulated by her peers, but unknown from the general public, A Bright Light is a documentary made of music and art that questions the creative process. On a wild and enchanted journey from Colorado to Woodstock, three women search for this once upon a time muse. Along the way, they encounter those who knew her as well as those whom she still haunts and influences today. The film draws the portrait of this exceptional artist, furiously free, who refused the system and its compromises. Through this iconic figure, we follow the quest of a certain freedom of life and expression and an independence for better or worse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bu6CaNNPUF5LJtXvJ8QoJxcjsVh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85595,"logo_path":"/b7WeslTaEl82WgOywyfWMDwXkWX.png","name":"Intermezzo Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bright Light - Karen and the Process","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
