The film looks for the intangible and subjective element of the building’s history: the depth of its human print. The building appears as a sedimentation of life stories where each layer has left the trace of a passage. From the intimate nature of these stories, the film draws this fragile and undefined essence that could be called “the soul of the place”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4DZlVzeQcPFPxBXsPcJfEEhNXoq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bêka \u0026 Partners","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An intimate portrait of a masterpiece from the beginning of architect Auguste Perret’s career: the building located on 25 Bis, Rue Franklin in Paris.","title":"25 Bis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
