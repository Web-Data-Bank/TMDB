Particularly rich both on the musical level and in atmosphere, scrutinizing love in far-off lands (Turkey, Peru, Persia and America), it responds to the infatuation with exoticism that tinged all the arts of the century. Rameaus dance music is always quite suggestive, evocative of a movement or a pictorial atmosphere. As for the staging, Laura Scozzi brings her contemporary vision to these countries and travels.  Filmed at the Bordeaux National Opera, this production marked the Rameau celebrations in 2014 and was unanimously hailed by the international press","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cOwSzEODVEMRUULLOP7VoHMd9t4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Bordeaux","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rameau: Les Indes galantes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
