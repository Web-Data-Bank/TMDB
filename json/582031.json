With a sense of mischief and minimal resources pooled together by its contributors, the film tells the story of Fanon – a Black female filmmaker – beset by her demons ten floors up in an oceanside hotel, gazing out over African shores during the hermetically-sealed weirdness that is the world of a film festival. Using elements of fiction and documentary, the film follows Fanon as she wrestles with what the film industry expects her to be, and not to be, as she readies herself to pitch her first film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mu7GggTsQXlFWOALV9CRs4bxen2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film Festival Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
