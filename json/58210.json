Clarkson sets out to explore both what compels us to pursue these limits--often at considerable risk to our own safety--and what effect the quest has on us. The result was an immensely engaging series, a few highlights of which are collected on this video. The best moments are those that find Clarkson sticking to the brief: interviewing the aristo-twit tobogganers of the Cresta Run; trying to understand why he, an experienced driver, will never be as fast as Michael Schumacher or Colin McRae; a musing on the qualities needed to be a fighter pilot; an examination of the extraordinary sport of speed-skiing, in which cat-suited kamikazes hit speeds of up to 150 miles an hour.","popularity":1.476,"poster_path":"/vZbG28b4gtVVfOlEQctNgACmixy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":71940,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Learning Channel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The best moments from the TV series in which Jeremy Clarkson meets people who are addicted to speed.","title":"Jeremy Clarkson's Speed","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
