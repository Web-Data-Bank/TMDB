Their formerly close-knit group has all but disbanded in the wake of encroaching adulthood. But when Jack tries to hang himself from a plant hook while house-sitting, he inadvertently triggers an impromptu reunion that brings the old gang back together and could change everything. Forever. Welcome to DAKOTA: friendship, fistfights, concussions, quarter-life crises, blow-ups, breakdowns, toy guns, telemarketing, love, lies, and breakfast - all in someone else's home. In this dark, offbeat comedy everyone comes together to examine what went wrong. Along the way, they may just remind each other what went right.","popularity":0.932,"poster_path":"/9B8VtCaG7ZBsmAR7kkq8NGXi3Ao.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The only thing harder than leaving home is coming back.","title":"Dakota","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
