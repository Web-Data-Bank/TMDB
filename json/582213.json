One of a missing young man with Asperger's Syndrome who seeks refuge in the underground labyrinth of NYC. The other follows a gambling Ecuadorian livery driver & a Chinese woman desperate to get home to her sick child. Along each of their journeys through the urban landscape, they discover the deeper understanding of communication & their intimate connections despite their barriers. H.O.M.E. is an understated yet lyrical exploration of urban alienation & meaningful encounters through the lens of a \"disconnected\" city in constant motion.","popularity":1.451,"poster_path":"/oK1QIZtQuhWB7IEivFX5HGiA7kX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gashouse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A \"love letter\" to New York City through its subways & enclaves","title":"H.O.M.E.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
