Played by choreographer/dancer Fran√ßois Chaignaud, a sprightly group of Muses emerges dancing from a painting on the wall. At an exhibition at the Swiss Institute in 2016 Dellsperger reproduced the wall painting and in a strange switch the creation of the set precedes the idea of the film, even becoming its trigger. The entire equilibrium of things seems to be affected : the shots are reversed and Kira dances backwards until she becomes one with the wall. The loop is closed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mDq9KVscxmwOzFYTCoJImISYHzo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body Double 35","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
