Most of them go back once the season gets over. Few choose to stay back, digging deeper into the traces of a hippie hangover, or trying to search oneself through the incandescent, colorful, trippy shores of Goa. And a few yet, get in so deep at the wrong end of paradise, that they are lost forever, in the same place, but in a whole different world altogether. The film takes one such real-life character - Roy - through a plethora of happenings, phenomena, legends, myths, sights, sounds, experiences and thrilling stories of the fabled Goan paradise. What happens to the protagonist through the bitter-sweet, darkly funny, crazy, trippy journey and what comes along at the end of it, weaves the half-fictitious/half-real story of our film - CandyFlip.","popularity":0.628,"poster_path":"/ps8ow4vAh9uwGVqWRdcu6WRCgmy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Candyflip","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
