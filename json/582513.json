So he gets drunk and wishes upon a star ... just as a spaceship is flying overhead, and an alien buzzes out and follows him home. Using his comic drawings on the walls as a guide, the alien assumes human form (to become Jacqueline Law) and calls herself Mah-Hey. Girlfriend gets understandably upset and walks out. Artist and Mah-Hey get jobs in a new firm, where she gives him support and help to succeed where he failed before. In between, Mah-Hey drinks water by the large bucketload, occasionally helps artist win fights, and looks into his dreams while he sleeps.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Win's Music \u0026 Video Enterprises (Hong Kong) Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonder Girlfriend","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
