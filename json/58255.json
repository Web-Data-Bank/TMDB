The movie starts with Art Chew traveling to America, as well as showing Art's training at the Shur-li temple (a play on words with the child actor Shirley Temple), showing many kung-fu clich√©s such as grabbing the pebble from the masters hand (which Art succeeds without effort), fighting on trees in this case small potted palms and \"listing\" for elements (Earth, Wind and Fire play a funky tune). After the montage is shown Art meets up with his cousin Wayman (A parody on the way Chinese pronounce r as w) a Chinese adult who tries to act American so he isn't embarrassed by stereotypes and foster cousin Roy Lee, an African American who sincerely believes he is a reincarnation of Bruce Lee.","popularity":0.895,"poster_path":"/6WYhXaB0zM3CZoBfyhqyJ0nhaIj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"All the action, twice the laughs... no M.S.G.","title":"Kung Phooey","video":false,"vote_average":5.375,"vote_count":8}
