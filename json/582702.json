No one but the little girl goes to see her. To attract visitors, the director of the zoo orders an advertising giraffe. But then it turns out that people are only fascinated by artificial giraffes, they are not interested in a living animal. The general \"giraffe boom\" begins. The film ridicules the fascination with \"mass culture\" not from the real and the living, but from the imitation and the artificial.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1rbJW8e5mW05MnnR6dz3GqRCk5L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1986-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giraffe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
