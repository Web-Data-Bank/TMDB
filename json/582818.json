The performance was a translation of Kafka’s \"Ein Bericht für eine Akademie\". The resulting video work is about the giving of voice - its internal and external experience - the predictive moment before a word and short term memory after it - immediate past and near future mixing with the present/presence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zkr8GzvY1XSIqUiQWLTVJYJGNLA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lecture to an Academy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
