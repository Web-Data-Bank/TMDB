The main difference is that Raban’s work was made when cinematic media had distinct physical properties linking medium directly to image - this self portrait recognizes that there is no such simple materiality for cinema following the emergence of digital processes. Instead the work takes a conceptual base – the speed of light and the time taken for light to travel from the sun to illuminate objects on earth –thus the duration of 8 minutes 20 seconds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w3iEQn2eirlEQQkoC9dRnqdvMIG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self Portrait After Raban Take Measure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
