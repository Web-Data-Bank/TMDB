I returned to the Kafka house of my ‘Benefit of Mr K’ but found the whole street and Castle area had become a tourist trap – so I wandered into the back-streets at the bottom of the hill and found a little local bar for a plate of sausage, mustard and strong brown bread. Intending to drink some wine I noticed that Absinthe was included in the drinks list so ordered it. I admitted to the bar-keeper that I had never had it before and he showed me how it should be mixed and flamed with sugar – and I recorded with my pocket video camera. With a little gesture to Picasso and Degas, I became the Absinthe Drinker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/far2BBsikqwwirKKjX4OMqEIZAn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absinthe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
