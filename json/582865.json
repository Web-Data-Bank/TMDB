Included are the captivating accounts of six fighter pilots who risked their lives day after day to combat the Luftwaffe, which was at that time greatly more experienced in aerial warfare. Their memories are enhanced by the recollections of a gunner, two members of the 400,000-strong ground crew who kept as many aircraft flying as possible, a barrage balloon operator and men who helped to build Spitfires.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fFrtLfZ3aB6eQZgVm6S5qENca28.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114961,"logo_path":null,"name":"1st Take Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In association with RAF Museum Hendon","title":"Voices of the Battle of Britain","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
