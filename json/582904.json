He walks head down, sad, in suit, hat, and wire-rim glasses. In this nearly wordless animation, bad things happen to him. First an elevator malfunction leads to a trip to the hospital: he leaves with his arm in a sling. Another accident at work results in another hospital visit. The same indifferent stretcher bearers and the same indifferent nurse see to his care. Now, his leg is in a cast as well as his arm. He soldiers on, using a cane. When a traffic sign malfunctions, it's back to the hospital; he leaves with bandaged head, piloting a wheelchair. But his woes aren't over yet. After one more mishap, Philip Jenkins finally has something to say.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/P7YxZx28LxENVZWoj4OrguuzDx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30241,"logo_path":null,"name":"AtomFilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Bad Day for Philip Jenkins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
