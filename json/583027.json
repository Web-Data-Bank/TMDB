This taped version was specially prepared for cable TV in 1981, then released on videocassette a few years later. Gregory and Maurice Hines head the exuberant, toe-tapping cast. Among the highlights are such Blake standards as \"I'm Just Wild About Harry\". The race issue is brought into play every once in a while, but never in such an omnipresent fashion as to dampen the spirits of this sparkling example of Broadway at its best.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3slZNGGEa5unUcZbyFJiR6oJdWG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eubie!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
