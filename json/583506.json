The sad events that preceded and impelled the organization of the manifestation are kept in memory. Those were times of reaction to extreme homophobic violence. In 2018, people with different life histories, sexual orientations, sexual characteristics, identities and gender expressions were united by freedom in love and self-determination of gender. On October 7, 2018, the 1st March for LGBTI + Rights was held in Viseu, and more than 20 organizations from Viseu, Vila Real, Bragança, Coimbra, Porto and Lisbon participated. We marched for the present and the future, joining the will of those who are proactive in defending basic human rights in an attempt to eliminate violence and exclusion. More than a thousand people marched in Viseu. The Municipal Council of Viseu ignored the March as they have not participated in it and refused to participate in this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a1HtdEWnAFgMFxjGj3RP9zZm5Pr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marchamos","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
