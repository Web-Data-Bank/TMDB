Raw film was spooled onto a spiral and partially submerged in developer, so that only half the film is developed, leaving the trace of a time spiral in the image and (optical) sound. The film can be projected in either direction. Outwards, from the centre of the spiral, we hear a decelerating sound like someone regaining their breath.\r G.S.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zAQZ8vlBZv3d1avLVqvQnCkt0ca.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1974-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
