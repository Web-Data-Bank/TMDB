Autistic kids in Morocco do not have a right to go to school, and when parents are able to find a classroom where their child is accepted, it is up to them to pay for it. The documentary was inspired by Jackie Spinner's two sons she adopted from Morocco when they were infants. The boys also are autistic and now living in the United States. Spinner, a journalist and former Baghdad bureau chief for The Washington Post, returned to Morocco with her sons in 2017 essentially to answer the question: What might have happened if they had stayed?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":115091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Moroccans Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Forget Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
