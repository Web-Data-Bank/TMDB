It’s been five years since the Swedish DJs played together as a group, with the trio playing the final performance of their ‘One Last Tour’ shows on Ultra’s main stage back in 2010.\r Rumours that SHM would reunite at Ultra have been circulating for the past few months, despite several statements denying the reunion from the group’s manager Amy Thomson and SHM member Steve Angello.  Earlier on 28/03/2018, a reunion was all but confirmed by friends and collaborators of the group via Instagram, while new and simplified SHM logos have been popping up around Miami over the last 24 hours.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wnfAPAQykzgZj2yG9WwL9STtJcr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swedish House Mafia: Live at Ultra Music Festival, Miami","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
