Worshippers at the shrine of Elvis and followers of pop culture take note. Ten Thousand Points of Light is a wry, understated and terrifically funny look at the Townsends, a suburban Atlanta family, who every holiday season for eight years, transformed their Stone Mountain area brick ranch house into a meteoric blaze of Christmas lights.
