The documentary gives us an intimate glimpse into a world most of us luckily do not have to know. Although often as funny and surprising as a sitcom, it bluntly points to the hardships and desperation of the marginalized. As the pawnbroker states: \"You don't see it in your rarefied living conditions, you don't see how the poor people live, unless you come here. Tragic, some of it.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hKN3cRekPoSYupSMMmUuvBx7vPW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155455,"logo_path":"/66aLE1oKttqtLEk7cJPJnEGBRKW.png","name":"ID: Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broke","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
