Featuring George Takei and many others who were incarcerated, as well as newly rediscovered photographs of Dorothea Lange, And Then They Came for Us brings history into the present, retelling this difficult story and following Japanese American activists as they speak out against the Muslim registry and travel ban.  Knowing our history is the first step to ensuring we do not repeat it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/demKq0BQuXaaRjxAAsWsJZGm6ts.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Executive Order 9066","title":"And Then They Came for Us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
