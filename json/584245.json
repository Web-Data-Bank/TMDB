Most of the source material was unwittingly supplied by a Chinese herbalist. To produce Arapadaptor Geyer applied a flashlight and laser, a la Man Ray, to the caterpillars, cicadas and seeds of the herbal packages. Much of the original footage was further manipulated - painted, tinted and/or bleached. Finally, the images were rephotographed, slowed, through the use of an optical printer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arapadaptor (I Feel So)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
