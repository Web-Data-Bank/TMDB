German director Hans JÃ¼rgen Syberberg, who was a child during World War II, doesn't try to recreate history to the letter. Instead, he places his actors -- many of whom play several roles -- on a stage and has them reenact events based on and inspired by Hitler's life. The action combines traditional narration and historical characters, but also idiosyncratic tweaks, like the use of puppets.","popularity":2.625,"poster_path":"/gNI82AHWfQJrlL0NpvnLPrNmUZn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":442,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler: A Film from Germany","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":15}
