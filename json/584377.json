Described as hilarious, complex, stupid, irritating (and 'sardonic' by one lady in Goa) the show veers in and out of the familiar and the bizarre with equal comfort. A knee-slapping head-scratching torrent of jokes, characters and self-aware comedy that successfully spent the entire budget that was available to spend on the show. Featuring six very silly live sketches, stitched together by a much sillier story about the nature of art itself and bookended by extremely silly and unnecessary opening and closing, Sketchy Behaviour is truly a work of something.","popularity":1.462,"poster_path":"/qHWrt15TMPerivsFUQg9uK81qto.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sketchy Behaviour","video":false,"vote_average":9.7,"vote_count":3}
