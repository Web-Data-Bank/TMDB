Based on a multi-character narrative structure, the film re-interprets the velocity, prime-time, rebellion, physical pleasure and ethical minefield referred to in these plays. With its Dream-like images, The Walker reminds us of the utopia pictured previously by the Taiwan Walker Theatre, indicating a polysemous, hybridized art world whose components range from the sublime to the ridiculous.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2017-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Walker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
