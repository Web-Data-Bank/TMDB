The four filmmakers want to tell a story together, but having grown up on other sides of history, they have different views on how to tell that story. What should it look like? Who should be in it? For whom is it made? Faire-part is the search of four filmmakers for a way to portray the city. Through filming artistic performances in public space, they paint a provocative picture of Kinshasa and its relations with the rest of the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o6xlQXAlvBKllM4hZzxaiKsvkgE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"2018-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faire-Part","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
