His clients include the leader of a religious sect, a friend who needs a final fix, a former lover who has had his child, a student, and a black marketeer. Fliegauf's film recreates life in a city that resembles a ghost town, an alienated world with its own priorities and realities. It is, he says '. an imaginary city with a strongly spiritualist atmosphere. This necropolis is the film's real protagonist'.","popularity":0.941,"poster_path":"/jnwSc6aB1RSbOIQ1mo5LT8NzQAA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45740,"logo_path":"/rKcwtO2jnwdBBEdCE80zOXEoJXL.png","name":"Filmteam","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":11007,"logo_path":"/irlUVryOnJuz7iD5K7cy1bdQH4e.png","name":"Inforg Studio","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2004-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dealer","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":16}
