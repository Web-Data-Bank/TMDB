Director Zheng skillfully interweaves the traditional storytelling performance with a humorous, and somewhat absurd narrative which blurs the distinction between life and performance, illusion and reality. Deeply rooted in local Tianjin culture, the films authentic depiction of the atmosphere of the city is filled with wisdom and energy. Insightful and highly entertaining, the film is a brilliant technical tour-de-force.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rmB5z1jdciepHJfBA5zUvxWDZOd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Useless Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
