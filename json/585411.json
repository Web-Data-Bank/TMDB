The \"comfort women\" issue has previously been treated almost exclusively within the framework of Korean nationalism. The Silence will provide insight into the ways in which nationalism and the emergence of post-war Asian nation-states have hindered the understanding of \"comfort women\" narratives through Zainichi Korean documentary filmmaker Soo-nam Park's point of view.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kmj8vNn4iJgVS9gouPXqUkx9wa8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arirang Production","origin_country":""},{"id":53366,"logo_path":"/5fbWZ4BsG9gh50cay7lOj5aKguu.png","name":"Cinema Dal","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2017-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silence","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
