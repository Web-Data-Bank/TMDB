Author, film director, film producer, journalist, critic and politician. Jörn Donner is known for producing Fanny and Alexander and received an Oscar for it. But he has also been known for being bellicose and naturally he fights with the filmmakers Alberto Herskovits and Olavi Linna as they try to film him. He is especially cantankerous when they ask him to do something in front of the camera that he finds inane. He doesn’t want to prostitute himself anymore, he wants to talk! This desire provides a key to this quick-witted man’s incessant restlessness and his quarrels stand as a backdrop that facilitate the dialog Donner wants to have.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u0vDE6OP8pZNzpB9X8meR4czrEI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Franckforstén Oy","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":115407,"logo_path":"/eWu9VGD5sUExsvNQTtxt6AyytgO.png","name":"Altofilm","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En film om Jörn Donner","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
