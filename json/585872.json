The Italian baritone brings a powerful, versatile voice to his role, but also brings his character a hilarious buffo quality. Daniele Gatti, one of the most acclaimed opera conductors working today, leads a stunning cast of singers including Barbara Fritolli as Alice Ford.  Genuinely warm italianita in all of the music-making, combined with a boisterous production by stage director Sven-Eric Bechtolf, turns Verdis commedia lirica into a fireworks display of high spirits as well as what the Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung called musically and dramaturgically a feast of life and of love of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mUioqImaZskdxDeAfFDf9aEW4yB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falstaff - Zurich","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
