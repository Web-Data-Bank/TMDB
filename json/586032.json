Taking a quick corner, the team tumbles out into the woods as their car pulls away. Now they must make their way through the thick of nature and thick gunfire to accomplish their mission. Not a single word of dialogue is spoken throughout the entire film. Instead, the music, sounds, images and deeply truthful acting turn a simple plot into an intense experience. Passion and intrigue keep building to the very end.","popularity":1.411,"poster_path":"/gmArXynq0fjMjdLaj9E893Jp6TB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1","video":false,"vote_average":8.038,"vote_count":13}
