Rather, it offered an exclusive, \"behind the scenes\" look into WWE and its talent, both in-ring and otherwise.[1] The show also periodically broke kayfabe and used professional wrestling slang. Confidential was discontinued in 2004 and was replaced with The WWE Experience, a more traditional weekly summary show.","popularity":1.121,"poster_path":"/8ZrjnP2mKtaH8OZ700QOk4c9fSQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WWE: The Best of WWE Confidential, Vol. 1","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
