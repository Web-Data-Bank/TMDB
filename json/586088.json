It is this memory which is said to bind a parent and a child, a husband and a wife or any other intimate relationships. The film explores Shatarupa’s search for her father in Kolkata. She finds the voice of her father in a young man. The paternal traits draw her towards him, but she finds herself trapped elsewhere between emotional complexities and simplicity. The film also draws a parallel with Hindu mythological tale of Lord Brahma, who was attracted to his own daughter Shatarupa","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7QrF9N4dXy5J0tS5GcU1DLKxuVe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runanubandha - The He Without Him","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
