Now the story of their journey is told in a heart-warming new documentary film.  Run Free: The Documentary shows the struggles and triumphs of these young men as they create a piece of theatre that impacts both them and their community, a journey that saw them travel across the world, many for the first time, from the streets of Kingston to the international stage.  Run Free was developed as part of the National Theatre of Scotland’s pioneering Jump programme. Originally presented by the National Theatre of Scotland, British Council, and Manifesto Jamaica, under the creative guidance of directors Simon Sharkey, Brian Johnson, and choreographer Liane Williams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":115529,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Theatre of Scotland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JM","name":"Jamaica"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Run Free","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
