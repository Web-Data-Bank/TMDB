In 1960, the director Eino Ruutsalo spoke of the movie with these words: \"The camera moves around the night - loose images are created - they create memories, consortia in us, or do not create. Man as such is interesting. Woman for a man. Man for a woman. There is no final destiny - there are only events. Different people touch each other - nothing is too solid and not ready. Everything hovers and gets new shapes\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6B4r03VWJxJmANmjZoc8MjTPNpN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eino Ruutsalo","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1961-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hetkiä yössä","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
