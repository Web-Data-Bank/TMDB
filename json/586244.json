Smogi has a particular relationship with dogs but also with the power of the elements, nature and the sly spirits that inhabit him (the djinns). “Djo” crosses different belief systems in a wild syncretism where the Muslim call to prayer also marks a moment of reunion with the animist and impure forces of the forest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/clUCwGW5dyhLy76IUEK45agE20W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Djo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
