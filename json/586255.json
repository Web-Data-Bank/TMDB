The filmmaker himself suddenly appears on screen with his real name, and the process of making a film with his friends is described. There are casual, everyday conversations with a girl who happens to be an actress and her friends. At the end, the filmmaker visits the girl's room. This is the \"truth of the filmmaker's own life\" captured by the camera, which moves almost continuously and without any sense of artifice. The last scene in particular is condensed and infinitely endearing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u1XSmlYGbY453uBJPTZ0hRlbVfO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whistling...1985","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
