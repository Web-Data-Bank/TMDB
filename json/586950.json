At 7.30pm, Nancyâ€™s husband Jim called the police.\r What followed was one of the biggest manhunts the nation had ever seen. More than 52 years later, the manhunt continues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uf0552OX8HOQNoDaUURUFqwUWtB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46814,"logo_path":"/b3sb5sFRj0EEpMHlNtFBO0fQKSw.png","name":"Seven Network","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2018-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What Really Happened to the Beaumont Children?","title":"The Beaumont Children: What Really Happened","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
