However, pharmaceutical manufacturers and many health authorities are refusing to acknowledge there is a problem and the medical community is continuing to offer the vaccine.  Sacrificial Virgins – so named because the vaccine is often given to girls before they become sexually active – exposes increasing evidence of serious neurological damage following the HPV injections. It calls for the vaccine to be withdrawn in the hope that this will help to halt another global tragedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacrificial Virgins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
