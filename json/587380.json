In the nineteenth century Glasgow enjoyed the fruits of heavy industries developed along the Clyde, but fell on harder times in the twentieth century. The fall of the empire and disintegration of traditional industries resulted in the creation of slum areas, but in later decades the city found acclaim through the architectural achievements of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and in 1990 was made the European City of Culture. One issue that continues to divide Glasgow, however, is the on-going battle between fans of the two resident football clubs, Rangers and Celtic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o8uAtklCeKSmY6TlYqOMK2145L2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glasgow Through the Ages","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
