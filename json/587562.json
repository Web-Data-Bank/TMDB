But, when we revisit our curious, loveable pals, the entire animal kingdom’s survival is once again at stake. Amid the prospect of no new land on which to live and prosper, not to mention the ever-diminishing food resources, the mood on board the Ark is laden with mounting tensions, which regularly spill over into ark rage. Fragile peace is frequently broken with general chaos ensuing. How can our unlikely heroes help? And what lies beneath for Finny in an oceanful of possibilities when he quite literally falls into some rather surprising new company?","popularity":12.204,"poster_path":"/ckcn7tYzqVUABxMZhqHUbaSeLKf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moetion Films","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":50163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ulysses Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":50164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fabrique d'images","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2020-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They're taking a ride on the wild side","title":"Two by Two: Overboard!","video":false,"vote_average":7.589,"vote_count":141}
