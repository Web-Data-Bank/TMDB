His friends, colleagues, fellow performers, housekeeper, driver etc, all talk about the real Graham Kennedy they knew – utilising rare footage not previously seen on Australian television – with wonderful memories from Denise Drysdale, Rosemary Margan, philip Brady, Stephen Curry, Mike McColl-Jones and many more. This is not just another re-hashed TV special – but a new, rare insight into the boy from Balaclava – who became the undisputed “King of Australian Television”. produced by Bob phillips, one of the producers from Kennedy’s break-thru Channel 9 program ‘In Melbourne Tonight’","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4eW4zOH0ZgearDD9UVIj4T7AgL1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Graham Kennedy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
