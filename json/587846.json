Taylor. Lt. Taylor talks to the men about the necessity of becoming practiced in the way of the aircraft in such a way as to enable them to rely on their senses much of their time in the air, as reliance on instruments can be confusing for beginning pilots. He explains that, at first, flying will be like walking or riding a bicycle were first learned -- by trial and error and following strict instructions. But with practice, eventually the pilot's senses will take over and much of the process of flying will rely more on his feel for the plane and less on rote following of instructions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Loew's Incorporated","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primary Flight Training: Flight Sense","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
