But this time he didn't count on being interrupted by a rather over zealous cop who's willing to do just about anything, no matter how dangerous (or stupid), to save the damsel in distress. Will our hero save the girl before Geoffrey's home made death machine goes off or will Geoffrey add another victim to his ever growing list - and just how can our hero make Geoffrey stay dead?
