Along the way, he meets the people who played key roles in the music scene of Tanzania during the struggle for independence and the nation's formative years under the first president, Julius K. Nyerere. As Kitime plays with the band, spends time with musicians and digitizes reel-to-reel tapes from the 1960s and '70s, he reveals a fascinating and little-known story about the power of music to bring together a people and a nation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nX3Fvulg9kL6AEvC9N3lGRjynZT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TZ","name":"Tanzania"}],"release_date":"2018-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ancestors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
