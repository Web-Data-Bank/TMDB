Music by the Unidentified Flying Objects. \"The grand prize ... went to Andrew Meyer's black-and-white AN EARLY CLUE TO THE NEW DIRECTION, whose virtues had nothing to do with technical polish. Mr. Meyer's film hung on dialogue, cast and plot (of a kind), clearly moving in a new direction. Its central virtue was nothing less than a superb performance by an old man, Prescott Townsend, playing a Boston rogue long past his time, who charms a young girl with his 'snowflake theory.'\" â€“ Douglas M.
