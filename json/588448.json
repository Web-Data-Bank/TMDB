Trying to fill a void in her life, Maggie feels the need to locate her birth mother. What she finds is not what she hoped for. Maggie finds a mother that does not love her or want her. Maggie gets caught up in this woman's world. After a few months enough becomes enough and when all hope is lost, one desperate night she reaches her breaking point. In a rage, she releases her frustrations by destroying the seedy hotel room that has been her home.
