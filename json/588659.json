Her daughter Pegah is a rebellious youth, part of a generation in search of an identity they're yet to find. Together they live with Minoo's mother - three women of three different generations, living in the past, present and future. When Pegah takes off on an existential journey, Minoo realizes she needs to reconnect her fracturing family, and sets out to find Pegah - encountering a myriad of Tehran characters, including an improvisational indie rock band. Things take a turn for the worse when she loses her mother along the way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c63HOelaNmLTwOUH3Uk3RJ7MoO1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Women","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
