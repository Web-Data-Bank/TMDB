In their interpretation, there is “no moment, no movement, that goes against the musical meaning” (R. Chailly). The result is an energetic, authentic, and atmospherically strong Bohème, “in which every sacred phrase receives its own orchestral colour, its own dynamic and its own expression.” (Corriere della Sera)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2HLMqdTBjOkM2E2PI11uGiKu2Ps.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accentus Music","origin_country":""},{"id":174190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2013-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Bohème","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
