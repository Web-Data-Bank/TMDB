Parking lots, hen houses, and brownstone apartments become the dwellings of many strange creatures; coyotes are rendered forest spirits, neighbors as martians, and night crawlers as flesh-eating meteorite worms. Employing sci-fi, documentary and ethnography techniques, a state of mind particular to early youth is sublimated - weight is lent to shadows as vast as space, ripe with discoveries both minuscule and immense.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5oeLrO9K9CkvV0CJW8jdCO9QD8P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Black Hole is a Black Hole in the Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
