The transaction being satisfactorily accomplished, he remembers that he does not possess a corkscrew, and consequently he request the wine merchant to remove the cork for him. This done, Bill places his finger to the mouth of the bottle and departs upon his homeward way. As may be imagined, before he has gone very far he discovers that the improvised stopper is resulting in a leakage of champagne, and, in investigating matters, he lets fly a tremendous volume into the faces of passes-by.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pKZrFncfAvOc5VxObsewwdvOrdf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12243,"logo_path":"/hztlrOaMK77kKdErDwogso0m2YS.png","name":"Lux Compagnie Cin√©matographique de France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1911-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La bouteille de Patouillard","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
