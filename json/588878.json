We often give up and walk. When we commit ourselves to waiting the bus usually appears with a second bus, empty, trailing by a block. We assume the drivers feel free to stop and gab between rounds; not nice, but then the job is impossible and it’s understandable they need a break, some social activity. There’s a couple of stops we wait at a lot, after visiting with friend Max or returning at night from Anthology Film Archives. Worse for Flo than for me; I photograph. I dawdle in the streets in any case, photographing a compulsion since getting a 3D camera. And night is a great time for time-exposures, for distortions in 3D.\" - Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joys of Waiting for the Broadway Bus #1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
