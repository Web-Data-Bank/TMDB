I enjoyed AVATAR and HUGO, though not much else among the movies I’ve seen in illusionary depth. They place things in depth but don’t go at depth as a realm to be investigated, toyed with; no mindbenders other than story. Cezanne, Cubism, never happened. This movie begins to play with possibility, with things only sometimes appearing real.\" - Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joys of Waiting for the Broadway Bus #3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
