Since acquiring a small 3-D camera I dawdle everywhere but prolonged bus-waits allow for a continuity of images, thus a movie. Computer-editing with Nisi Jacobs allowed further investigation, this time into digital 3-D itself.” - Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joys of Waiting for the Broadway Bus #4","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
