Southern Iran. We are at the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war. Abadan, the capital of the Iranian petrol industry resists the repeated assaults of the Iraqi army, but is soon under full siege. Omid, a 14-year-old boy, has stayed back in the city, with his grandfather, waiting for his elder brother to come back from the frontline. Along with Omid, we discover several other uncommon characters, each one having stayed for a personal reason. Each one resisting in his own way. But as the Iraqi siege of the city hardens, Omid has to quickly find a way to save those he loves.","popularity":1.168,"poster_path":"/N0CO2An4yMPHYSyWHdS04Ey04o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'ici","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11794,"logo_path":"/vjyzeaIhRdtMfDIVGAECNirIkGw.png","name":"Lunanime","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":208,"logo_path":"/bxQYlRhQu6nbohBEL0SWz8xIAGy.png","name":"Bac Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8112,"logo_path":"/6IIvfhyzyvddO5qT8hOXzU2WKUb.png","name":"TrickStudio Lutterbeck","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":122128,"logo_path":"/iYPn1TwMpJXPRTF9O0m4h0nEmCS.png","name":"Special Touch Studios","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":193793,"logo_path":"/xtsC35g0iCpBZoWpbIj867bYrWe.png","name":"Rêves d'Eau productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":122125,"logo_path":"/8zUJP4URxf0t2l96xvDbqm5vqGf.png","name":"Amopix","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":150026,"logo_path":"/wMAoxh2ovKco6z31IZFwHepPZd0.png","name":"Les Fées Spéciales","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":68446,"logo_path":"/9GiI34u4iJu9gOYD28RRLgm51vf.png","name":"Katuh Studio","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":45015,"logo_path":"/7O9okD5UDjnyHUwNR3VZN3gbUpA.png","name":"Bac Cinema","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2023-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Siren","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
