This is the last station on earth for old people that called “clients”.  While they’re waiting for the end of their lives, prisoned in a desolate nursing home and their old-dying body,  they are fighting for the freedom of their soul, the only place they can feel young and alive.  A fight between light and darkness, suffering and acceptance, life and death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bpfjzs3VDzDiSH8X7tZvw4Cueae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Okapi Creative Studio","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":131245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nezavisni filmski centar \"Filmart\"","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2019-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valley of the Rulers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
