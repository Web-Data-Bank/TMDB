A lifestyle portrait, Making Our Own not only exposes the every day moments and challenges of a band on the fringes of mainstream culture, but also captures the spirit and drive of a collectively created and genre-defying international music community. With interviews and performances from bands, bookers, managers, and fans that Ms. Jorge encountered along the way, including Amsterdam legends The Ex, Roman visionary noise band, Zu, and more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l0zh9hTX9DWI45eH8RKxWjdKxlc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Making Our Own","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
