Mirror or projection, poor bastards have fun with everyday facts and do not tell a story, but stories. Through these short and bitter stories, are revealed all the cracks of the human race, which, in a movement of globalization and neoliberalism more and more assertive, can lead the ordinary man to be a monster of cowardice, cruelty, indifference or hypocrisy. Poor bastards from an odd angle, transcribe reality provocatively or not, always with the same ambition: to react.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9A03XOxTQbrUo6t2FfsRgAEkjkA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poor Bastards","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
