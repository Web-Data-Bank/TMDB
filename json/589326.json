Tracing its effective use by religious figures, politicians and marketers, director Larry Weinstein crafts a persuasive study of the mechanics behind propaganda. This fascinating investigation confronts us with timely questions: If we grow up surrounded by propaganda, how do we know what is true? What risks are inherited by a society tricked into their perceptions? Freedom of speech is critical to a democracy's survival, yet demagogues have consistently exploited that freedom to coerce willing supporters. Contemporary artists, including Kent Monkman, Shepard Fairey and Ai Weiwei, analyze their politically motivated work, creatively co-opting the conventions of disinformation that have permeated their respective cultures. As our platforms for spreading ideas continue to expand in a digital age, dangerous lies have never been better disguised.","popularity":1.916,"poster_path":"/dZGrPJy3FtIezdwcklZN8cSEf3w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51615,"logo_path":"/7kRlmKnoTAS80v2xk3znsHKApVH.png","name":"Hawkeye Pictures Inc.","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":86010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taglicht Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Propaganda: The Art of Selling Lies","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":11}
