Spectators are invited to discover them at a happening that mixes fiction and reality as domestic theater. Voyeurs are not always who we think they are. Guest/spectators, hosts, angel-guides, actors and technicians - all become characters in this fictional documentary where Alice's looking-glass reflects a mischievous fantasy with the roles reversed and complementing one another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Voyeurs are not always who we think they are","title":"Ciné-Romand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
