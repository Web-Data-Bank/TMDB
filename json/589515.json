Pianist and Schnabel devotee Markus Pawlik (in collaboration with baritone Dietrich Henschel and the Szymanowski String Quartet) brings Artur Schnabel's greatest compositions back to Berlin with a filmed commemorative concert. Along the way, Pawlik visits the places, landscapes, and history that shaped Schnabel's life and music. \"Artur Schnabel: No Place of Exile\" rediscovers an essential artist displaced by the catastrophe of the two World Wars and the Holocaust and inspired by the possibilities of modernism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l65GNcDfupFebh2xgb8SvhYkxc9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artur Schnabel: No Place of Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
