When Hemingway asks, which novel he means, Hawks says To Have and Have Not. Jules Furthman writes a script, which follows the book closely. The location of the story is Cuba, but the US Government is against depicting corruption and violence on Cuba, and threatens to withdraw the film's export license. William Faulkner rewrites the script, and relocates the story to Martinique. Hawks's wife, Nancy Slim Gross, happens to see a young model at the cover of the magazine Harper's Bazaar, and shows it to her husband. Hawks is a star-maker, who likes to discover and nurture new talents. After a screen test, he chooses the 19-year-old model as the lead actress opposite Humphrey Bogart. She changes her name from Betty Perske to Lauren Bacall. At the first takes she is so nervous that she shakes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qbnK77kkygi0mBSrqeriVxNIqIg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kurtti-Pellerin","origin_country":""},{"id":8922,"logo_path":"/yZWehAyjfKi4KvKeg1bkJ1bm5H8.png","name":"Turner Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Love Story: The Story of 'To Have and Have Not'","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
