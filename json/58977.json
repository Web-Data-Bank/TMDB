Using archival still and film clips as well as interviews with film historians, actors and Lugosi himself, the special chronicles the meteoric rise and then precipitous decline of a talented yet tragic man who forever changed the face of horror films.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/1hpPCtvDU9Lg94xw5VyW1dPn1ku.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4313,"logo_path":null,"name":"AVRO Television","origin_country":""},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2007-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bela Lugosi: The Fallen Vampire","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
