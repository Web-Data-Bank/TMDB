They wear clothes with fossils drawn on their back, carrying the identity of a buried memory. They use their bodies to hit the cities, provoking vibrations in the architectural structures and modifying the soundscape of their habitants. They listen the collapse of the silenced ruins, while watching the death of Albert Speer’s legacy. They capture the wind with their shake movements, revealing the voices that were separated from the language, the noises that were extracted from the objects. 7 limbos turns its eyes to the spectator and invites him: “Come dance with me, don’t bring anything”  7 limbos is a sound journey through the veiling of the spectral that passes through the membranes of visibility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6LWrSVW4Cjrc6GUMUVpvxuydSq1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7 Limbos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
