Felony convictions derailed the lives of the San Quentin Prison squad, some of them promising players. The rocky road to rehabilitation is the point of the game in this eye-opening, inspirational documentary. Q Ball‘s focus is on determined men grappling indelibly with the gravity of their crimes and reaching for redemption. The film zeroes in on about-to-be-paroled star player Harry “ATL” Smith, who has not surrendered his NBA dreams; Anthony “Ant” Ammons, a lifer who has become a mentor to younger inmates; and head coach Rafael Cuevas, a convicted murderer who understands his role in preparing his players for life on the outside. For all three men, the team is not just a means of recreation, but a form of family.","popularity":1.537,"poster_path":"/xJaDSFH5A6pDzFwDCHl2Y6XkKFB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Q Ball","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":24}
