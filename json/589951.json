Now I only have three days to pack my things. It‘s my sixteenth home, sixteenth room from which I‘ll move myself out. I am packing things and through my window I see another 215 windows. Through these windows I see immigrants, couples, misfortunes. Some read, some play, some sleep, some learn to walk on the balance beam, they come in, they go out. I am filming so I wouldn‘t forget about them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r5rGshic7smYN1S3J67I8o56PR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2019-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Windows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
