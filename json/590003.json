Tomasz is a deserter who tries to hide as far away from the battle as possible.  In the vast emptiness of northern Scandinavia he meets Lilja, the last survivor of a resistance group, who is determined to fight the superior machines. With every minute that passes the machines get closer, searching for the last remains of the human race. And the enemy doesn't just shoot on sight - their perfect sensors are programmed to recognize human voice patterns.  So if you speak or even whisper - you die.","popularity":1.247,"poster_path":"/kkpeYDMS0LPLPtQveJGvkLMk4V8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nocturnus Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They make the commands now.","title":"A Living Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
