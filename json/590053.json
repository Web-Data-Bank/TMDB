Instead of his \"yes\", the groom says \"no\" and runs away from the altar. Fortunately, overwhelmed Eliska has a great friend with a clear recipe for what needs to be done. She herself alternates boys as socks and therefore immediately bases her profile on a dating site. She doesn't like it very much, but she is middle-aged, she's single and she's afraid the train won't miss her. And she wants to take life more firmly in her hands. She therefore throws herself into a blind date and tries to find new love between a series of catastrophic meetings. At the same time, she has to move quickly and the only option is to live with her half-brother, a weirdo who grows bees on the roof and who does not want her at home.","popularity":0.814,"poster_path":"/1yKN8bbuLItX0Wo7MNhvCWx96gV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bontonfilm","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":29284,"logo_path":null,"name":"love.FRAME","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":118491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Beep","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":29285,"logo_path":null,"name":"FRAME100R","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":136728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradajka","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":136729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Durancia","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":136730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Výprava Chochola","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2019-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LOVEní","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
