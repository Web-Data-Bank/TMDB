Normally, these are done in sequence so as to remove any potential ugliness between the two. In Chorus, dry granular forms of both are added to the film stock simultaneously.

The film bears witness to the conflict, a sum of individual grains asserting and succumbing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ddvGxcY15HrkVTZGJPsHP6sYqD1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chorus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
