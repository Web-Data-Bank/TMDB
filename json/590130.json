Vinnie (Erik Palladino) bumps into the attractive Jessie(Brigitte Bako) at his uncle's wake, and when his aunt mistakes her for his latest girlfriend, she gladly plays the part-leaving out one small detail. Jimmy(Robert Longstreet) sets his sights on the seedy part of town-only to find love (Justina Machado) waiting for him in the least likely of places. And Ralph (Patrick Fischler) woke up a virgin on Friday morning only to have that situation reversed two times over by Saturday night. With an original score by jazz musician Kevin Eubanks (The Tonight Show with Jay Leno) \"The Week That Girl Died\" takes the notion of the romantic comedy and gives it a dose of what real people go through.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Week That Girl Died","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
