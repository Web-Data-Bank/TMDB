Cross-cutting between the girl protagonist and her father, the film creates a sense of crisis and conflict. As the girl invests her feelings in her surroundings and describes events connected to her father, we are drawn into a world of pain and pathos.  Morley's first directorial credit was her graduation film from Central St. Martin's School of Art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c2jYvZpPjq6ccwW0w3FMV0A871c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
