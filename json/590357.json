Rapu sets his gaze on his homeland in Eating Up Easter, where the Rapanui community faces an environmental collapse due to overwhelming tourism and industrial progress. Rapu himself serves as a narrator, describing to his son the depth of Easter Island's plight and the dilemma of the people who live there. Struggling to keep up with a land that refuses to slow down, the film features other locals making the best of an impossible situation: an ecologist who attempts to temper the rising waste crisis that affects both the island and the shores that surround it, a pair of musicians trying to establish a free music school that may help to preserve cultural traditions, and finally, Rapu's father, the island's former Governor, who is caught between responsibility to generations of culture and the ever-growing demands of industry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/syFSBDaE67hdzZUhhALpl7yOlAj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mara Films","origin_country":""},{"id":13042,"logo_path":"/k57hcv8sELrZCf1j33FDBNGDpF6.png","name":"Kartemquin Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2019-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eating Up Easter","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
