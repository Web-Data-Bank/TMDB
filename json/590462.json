That is the victory battle cry when kites are eliminated in raging sky duels, sometimes lasting hours. Filmed entirely in Lahore, Pakistan, over three continuous days, Bo Kata is a rare cinematic documentary treat, depicting uniquely the rooftop kite flyers of Lahore, who have been a traditional part of Pakistan's culture and heritage that has lasted for over 400 years. Their sport is now under threat from a complete ban, after a series of tragic fatalities involving children and motorcyclists, resulting in decapitations and dismemberment from illegal chemically coated strings used to fly the kites. The documentary highlights a population that is associated with the mysterious art of kite dueling amidst the political backdrop of an impending ban","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmedup","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bo Kata","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
