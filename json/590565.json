In it, the Air Corps' CG-4A glider is demonstrated in its cargo- and troop-carrying modes. Takeoffs, landings, and flight/towing characteristics are described. The principal function of the film is to familiarize the viewer with the shape of the glider, so that it can be recognized from any angle and not mistaken for enemy aircraft. The glider's long boxy shape, square-cut wings, rounded tail, and detachable wheels are explained with diagrams augmenting the photographic view of the aircraft from various viewpoints.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":101192,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Motion Picture Unit, United States Army Air Forces","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recognition of the CG-4A Glider","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
