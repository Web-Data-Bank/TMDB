She is angry but she doesn't know who she's being angry at. 'She' is actually a manikin and she's about to kidnap someone to ask for ransom money. The energetic and lively editing and sound are much alike Kim Gok and Kim Seon's previous work but their message to society is very direct and straightforward. The highlights of this movie are the unique narrative structure that twists the typical customs and the eccentric images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ql3bND4yIxV96uIkMdCGP1yELaU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self Referential Traverse: Zeitgeist and Engagement","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
