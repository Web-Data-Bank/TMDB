The family films shot by his father, pieces of Michel's first films shot in the Balearic Islands and in Athens, contemporary images with Teo Hernandez, to stolen dialogues between his mother and and his aunt, recorded without their knowledge. The author is the spider, at the center of a device that allows him to survive: he has woven the threads of his own web and is now in control of his personal situation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uRrWUyBb5mhQDqW1vNLrRIWtKn2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"À quoi rêve l'araignée ?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
