A place where they can forget their everyday life and gain courage to change a skate culture that has been dominated exclusively by boys for the past decades. DON’T GIVE A FOX follows three different girls in their early 20s, who each are seeking to gain a foothold. It’s a coming-of-age story about identity, love and skating.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yGKdjvko73UB584wes8ix9xbqie.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88293,"logo_path":"/q4uunfEJRQhTfzFdAFfC6zMvqPo.png","name":"Good Company Pictures","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2019-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Should we be as boring as our parents?","title":"Don't Give a Fox","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
