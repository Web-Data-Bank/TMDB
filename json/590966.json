Completed in 1965, the dam was to mitigate flooding in Pittsburgh, 198 miles downriver, but the 27-mile reservoir that formed above it inundated vast tracts of the Seneca Indians' ancestral lands, forcing their removal in breach of one of the United States' oldest treaties. Set against a backdrop of a federal Indian termination policy, pork-barrel politics, and undisclosed plans for private hydropower, Lake of Betrayal reveals an untold story from American history-a one-sided battle pitting a small Native American nation against some of the strongest political, social, and commercial forces in the country. Although the Seneca suffered irreplaceable cultural losses, the Kinzua crisis became a turning point to build a stronger Seneca Nation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cK1n6v0r8YpOZ14YfqOj8JMp5WB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lake of Betrayal: The Story of Kinzua Dam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
