Unfortunately, fallen star/tabloid queen Jamie Stephens already made it famous. Hollywoods constant rejection due to what Diane refers to as \"TJS\" (\"Too Jamie Stephens\") has made her bitter, frustrated....and, yes, whiny. Co-worker/boyfriend Jack Sanders doesn't help matters. His idea of ambition is letting it ride. Now he's in major debt to a trigger-happy mobster who, interestingly enough, has a thing for Jamie Stephens. Jack's only way out? Convince Diane to be Jamie and wipe out the debt having one meal with a made man. It's literally the performance of her life. With Jack's on the line.","popularity":3.427,"poster_path":"/kvJewsaWPfl0qpWhcGwygAe6dZ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5322,"logo_path":"/6Vk4WZnKJuC6z6HKBGFirbWwWwV.png","name":"Aloe Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-05-03","revenue":8000000,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fake it 'till you make it","title":"Hollywood & Wine","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":10}
