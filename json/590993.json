There was a fire. Nadia and Denis died.\" So casually, suddenly, terribly, irrevocably, her habitual life was crossed out, burned. Katya's husband Denis, a bright scientist, urbanist, together with his 11-year-old daughter Nadia were at the dacha in Beloretsk, Denis's birthplace. At his mom's. It seemed so quiet, beautiful... the happiest and safest place in the world.
