The new album was to be called \"SMiLE\". SMiLE pushed the envelope both musically and lyrically, and was supposed to out-do the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper record. But Brian wasn't able to sell the project to his band-mates when they returned. The project was shelved and Wilson's well-documented decline into depression, drug abuse, recluseness, and obesity had begun. Thirty-odd years later, Wilson announced that in 2004, SMiLE would be performed live in its entirety in London. This film tells the story of a damaged but healing artist bringing his greatest work to light.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/3HTPdYOL4zukZ0SKJRLnMpJoF95.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Plus: Brian Wilson Presents Smile Live!","title":"Beautiful Dreamer: Brian Wilson and the Story of Smile","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
