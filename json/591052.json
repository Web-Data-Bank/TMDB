Whatever the words, whatever the decisions, there will always be a side that feels aggrieved. Why does time fail to cure resentment? From the signing of the Evian agreements in 1962 to the skid of the candidate Macron, who was in February 2017 in opposition to the \"Pieds Noirs\" community for comparing the colonization of Algeria to a crime against humanity. The story is told through the experiences of exiles, activists, former soldiers and politicians, all involved in the events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iscKok990c0k5BDOvZ23uMCEAbe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"France Algérie : une affaire de famille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
