Demonstrating a ridiculous disproportion between an effort and its effect, the work is a metaphor for Latin American society, in which minimal reforms are achieved through massive collective efforts. Participants in the project gave their time for free, reversing conservative economic principles of efficiency and production. Embracing rumor, urban myth, and oral history, Alÿs aims to make works that continue beyond the duration of the event itself, through stories disseminated by word of mouth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5q0DQyJJsofP82v98oMSVS2z9NQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Maximum Effort, Minimum Result","title":"When Faith Moves Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
