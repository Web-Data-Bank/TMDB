Rhobi Samwelly, a brave local hero, stands up to her community and provides a Safe House to protect the courageous girls. Although female genital mutilation (FGM) is harmful and illegal, in Northern Tanzania it is widely believed that girls' clitorises must be cut off to reduce promiscuity. Mutilated girls also demand twice the bride price as uncut girls.  The chillingly named 'cutting season' runs through the school holidays in December. Now, some of the most courageous girls in the world, some as young as eight, are leaving everyone they love behind to run to a Safe House, not knowing if they'll ever see their families again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3SrCeABuWBMLqeJOa8LGsDmzSdn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Name of Your Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
