As time passes the stain dries up, shrinks and changes shape. Just before the water is completely evaporated the process is put on hold. The new shape of the stain is then being enlarged and recreated with new water. This process repeats and with these interventions the ‘life’ of the stain is artificially refreshed and extended to an unnatural length. Which allows new shapes to evolve that otherwise could never have existed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rWhHfWhWjlhbMPV8zzs3Zv0PPGr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Refreshment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
