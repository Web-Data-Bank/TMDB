I've toured it round the world, added a full-on death metal backing band, expanded it, honed it and even written a bestselling book based on it.  Now it's time to film that show, so I can capture the magic and then finally put it to rest.  Yeah, I could do it shit and just upload it on YouTube and hope some of you see it.  But that's not good enough. Not for this show. Not for HEAVY METAL.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2vJHjAGZyBeexQS2188alGJflS5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andrew O'Neill's History of Heavy Metal","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
