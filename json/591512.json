The objective of the roped party was to climb the 82 peaks over 4000 meters in the Alps, by carrying out the connecting routes on foot, on skis or by bike. All at the end of winter and the beginning of spring. They left on March 1, 2004, from Saint Christophe en Oisans. The film shows us in images this alpine adventure, from which the spirit of competition is excluded, to make way for the simple pleasure of being in the mountains. This posthumous film was edited after the disappearance of Patrick Berhault, which occurred during the expedition on April 28, 2004.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dcpbQGjoxk4cmJhnyFC683GJuwS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140202,"logo_path":"/6GwgCiSUcoKTN16xfExDM9qCl1f.png","name":"Migoo Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sur Le Fil Des 4000","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
