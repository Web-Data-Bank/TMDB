Having been chased around the world by the law, they have landed in New York. FBI agent Tass (Leslie Body) and a couple of comical Brooklyn cops he commandeers pursue them doggedly.  From the Mafias of Manhattan to the Mobs of Brooklyn, no one will protect the killers. Carving a path upstate, leaving a trail of bodies, they seal off a mountain resort and prepare for a final showdown.  Into this end game stumble a handful of staff counselors and a group of poachers.
