Magoo thinks that the flyer is a letter from his mother about her \"83rd birthday\" and begins to worry that maybe he hasn't spent enough time with his mother lately. He goes to pay his mother a visit to make up for lost time but upon arriving, Mother Magoo doesn't quite appreciate Magoo's attempts at being helpful such as baking a feather duster thinking it to be a turkey dinner. So she uses psychology to eventually persuade him to go back home (at least until next year).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8409,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Productions of America (UPA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meet Mother Magoo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
