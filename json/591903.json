Before he can orient himself, chaos breaks over him: snipers hit him, a half-naked warrior brandishes his ax and painful memories of his son haunt him. Meanwhile, a young couple is driven to the wedding ceremony that is to be held in this very forest. But the car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and the fact that the bride's father does not at all agree with an anti-nuclear activist as a son-in-law quickly turns out to be the smallest problem for everyone involved.","popularity":0.713,"poster_path":"/6mUZbds1Y6auHZKVMmXDqbInEB1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mimicry Freaks","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
