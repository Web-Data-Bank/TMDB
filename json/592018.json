Two absolutely distant and distinct worlds that needed to be confronted directly, due to the exponential growth of proLife extremist Catholic movements and their political ascent, thanks to the exploit of the right-wing parties that welcomed them into their row (the Fontana family minister and Senator Pillon, both members of the Family Day, are a clear example). But also because of the growing need for legal recognition that homogenitorial families are clamoring for, to which sometimes only the magistracy grants approval, due to the gaps in the law on civil unions of 2016 caused by the cutting of the Stepchild Adoption and the obligation of loyalty among the partners. The result is a desecrating mix between the silent normality of these families and the bawling madness of their protesters.","popularity":0.849,"poster_path":"/pbT4LLx17piNGlwRkJkJ2NBmhCb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Human Tree","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'unione falla forse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
