Their names: MONSTERS OF DEATH. Their character: vicious. MONSTERS OF DEATH doesn't waste your time with lullabies, instead it’s packed with the most deadly metal stuff conceivable: 55 video clips, cautiously compiled by Skandinavian-European and American style Death Metal, plus six live recordings and an ample audio section with new and unreleased stuff. In short: a blast for each and every death metal fan - not only because of the sheer amount of clips, but primarily because of their accurate selection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9hefUkmJU0dKPQoBaiuVfWa5Z8a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":205,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monsters Of Death Vol. 1","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
