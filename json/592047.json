This Emmy award-winning program tells the unforgettable story of ordinary people caught up in a mind-numbing disaster. Told through vivid first-hand accounts and stunning archival footage, Angels Too Soon is also the story of a fire that remains officially unsolved, despite the detailed confession of a 10-year-old student in the school.
