Many of these children were coming from dysfunctional homes, and going to school became recreation as an escape from their home life. School by most of them was not taken seriously, especially due to the inconsistency of their school day. Some joined gangs, became teen parents, and some fell victim to death in the streets. These children were attending schools where there was a daily shortage of teachers, not enough books, no heat, and some faced abuse at the hands of those that were supposed to educate them. The substitute teacher Ms. Stephens was able to convince many of these children that the circumstances of their past could not stop them for success in the future.","popularity":0.632,"poster_path":"/iS69LRVelJqFcd9Yan1tHEUhdpq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116536,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hoodeville Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sub in the Brick City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
