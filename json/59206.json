It features never-before heard studio recordings from the Double Fantasy sessions and never-before-seen outtakes from Lennon in concert and home movies that have only recently been transferred to video. It also features exclusive interviews with Ms. Ono, who cooperated extensively with the production and offers an unprecedented level of access, as well as with artists who worked closely with Lennon during this period, including Elton John and photographer Bob Gruen (who took the iconic photograph of Lennon in front of the skyline wearing a “New York City” T-shirt).","popularity":2.829,"poster_path":"/g3KP7DuYuHzGRA4avwrNPouRxdk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147790,"logo_path":null,"name":"Two Lefts Don't Make A Right","origin_country":""},{"id":99614,"logo_path":"/gXrb4q4TqBHCYEvjRa16WOE9NRs.png","name":"American Masters Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":106324,"logo_path":"/s3zNiYR6gmjGjI7fphaym7WuNLy.png","name":"A\u0026E Television Networks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LennoNYC","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":15}
