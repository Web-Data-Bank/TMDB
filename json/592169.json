There is a crooning cousin, family dinners with games and plays, and a great-uncle who still seems to live in the Vichy age. At the heart of this colourful cast is Maman, Bauer’s grandmother, who passed away during the shoot. What follows is an increasingly absurd story of a woman who, after her death, embarks on a journey that eventually becomes an odyssey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/evMoR7zKEu4NSb74vxnvwpEFf6x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maman Maman Maman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
