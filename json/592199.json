The mass media reproduces and celebrates the image of Vegas based on gratuity and transgression. LAS VEGAS IN 16 PARTS proposes a flirtatious dialogue with this collective perception through an aesthetic of appropriation. The film cannibalizes the sheen of the cityâ€™s voracious capacity for spectacle: from the 1950s, when atomic explosion tests became another tourist attraction, to the present, when a male stripper turns police brutality into the sensual fantasy of a bachelorette. A documentary about a concrete city, it inversely aspires to be a fiction of an improbable collective fantasy.\"","popularity":0.632,"poster_path":"/lbVC0h9F4ZcqiKye5CGum2vb8f4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las Vegas in 16 Parts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
