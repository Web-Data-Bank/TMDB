Dotson also “blows the bottle” using a Coca-Cola bottle partially filled with water. Both his bottle blowing and his one-strand-on-the-wall are important links between African musical roots and the blues. The one-strand marks the beginning of the “slide guitar” style which heavily influenced 20th-century blues, rock and roll, and rock music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pAeTlY6fFS41ynuPM7doUaSysI6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bottle Up and Go","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
