It comes as no surprise when he stands upon the victory podium and receives the winner's gold about his neck. And that's not all this young, hot swimmer receives. From the pool to the locker room Kyle quickly learns the old saying \"everybody loves a winner\" is truer than ever. Just as the roar of the crowd begins to fade, the steamy adulation only beginsâ€¦with a famous sportscaster, his teammates and even strangers in a parking lot falling victim to his enormous talent. From this point on the ensuing action gets so hot that the pool fairly simmers at a slow boil. Gold medal performances are nothing new to this All-American cast as the adoring public soon discovers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bKjbw9zmBylXJ8HEquiQH0ErK6l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107964,"logo_path":null,"name":"L.A.
