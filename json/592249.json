In addition, the sex offenders discuss how they set up and lived a double life, posing in public as kind and responsible members of the community while raping and molesting in private. Five vignettes are included of sex offenders who were either in pretreatment or treatment phases of an incarcerated sex offender treatment program. The videotape can be used to educate parents, teachers, therapists, prosecutors, judges, mental health workers, and others who are concerned about child sexual abuse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c3lAYMNU0iuB3gP3vZ0rCh63zIW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sadistic Versus Non-sadistic Sex Offenders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
