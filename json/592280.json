The temple is called Kôun’in whose roof has a tale passed down from ancient times.  The tale is based on the myth of dragon god: Once upon a time at a brumous crack of dawn, all kinds of snakes magically flocked to a waterfall. As soon as they merged into a single huge serpent, it started to fly up heavenward. But when it incarnadined his body with the red color of the roof, it transformed itself into a rising dragon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A4pA1IQqcPhSv8SZCYJTLDsM9kD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Above the Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
