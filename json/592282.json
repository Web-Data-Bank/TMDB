Through archive images, meetings around the world and interviews with sociologists, philosophers, historians, musicians, artists or biographers, the author takes us on a spiritual and existential journey. We cross the history of slavery, segregation and pan-Africanism, punctuated by ethereal beats, letting ourselves be invaded by the breath of words and saxophone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6e3iAddcyHPxkIK9N3CpXcbWJmS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black to Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
