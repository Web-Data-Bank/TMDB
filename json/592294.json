The play's main role of Geesche is played by Annick. But what does it mean to make a fictional character come to life when that character is so close to one's own experiences ? A number of questions arise concerning the impact of Geesche's story on the intimate and collective life of the actors and actresses involved in the play. Annick, Georges, Jean-Pascal, Jean-Paul, Anne, Nordine, Felix, Stephane and Marie-Pierre question how their real lives overlap with their theatrical roles. These questions eventually develop into a common reflection on how psychiatry, patriarchal violence and social constructions are ultimately interwoven.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i9ntnl6AxCu7VHvVvtaZHi9RLXJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What If the Sky Was Empty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
