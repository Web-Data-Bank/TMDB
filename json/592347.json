Using Mark Twainâ€™s \"Life On The Mississippi\" as a road map, Brown travels along the Mississippi River from Memphis, Tennessee to New Orleans and considers ways that river pilots, paddlers, historical re-enactors, and civil engineers attempt to know the river through modeling, measurement, and simulation.  Along the way, Brown attempts to survey the river and the landscapes and land uses along its banks as a visible expression of economic transition, political polarization, and environmental change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/imX4L5P3CmkN6rhjTn5Pkb1T297.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life on the Mississippi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
