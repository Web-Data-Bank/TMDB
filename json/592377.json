At some point, I experience a sense of dislocation of the time and space. It seems to me that my life has been spent in an infinite loop of tunnels, like a shuttle in inertia to absorb the past happenings. The time in the tunnels becomes less precise, and the intricacies of everyday life are hidden in strange corners. There is no end to the cycle of day and night, either in or out of the tunnel. Does this cycle of rebirth bring me joy or pain? Is it a vision or a destiny? I keep on exploring in the daytime and at night, but there is no resolution, nor any relief.” – HH","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Round the Clock (Waltz)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
