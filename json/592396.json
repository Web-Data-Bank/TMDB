But life is good, away from society and living of this leftovers. Lisbeth, Herbert and Walther have created their own self-sufficient little paradise. While Herbert is hunting cats, Lisbeth tends to the self-grown vegetables and Walther angles for usable scrap from the dump down below.  One morning though, the peace is disrupted: A nameless, suit wearing  stranger has appeared overnight and set up his tent among their huts. He does not speak, but obviously he intents to stay. The rooftop dwellers are anxious. Will he destroy their perfect little society? Or can he  be part of it… incorporated so to speak... ?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6am6KMnI57rTDIccDfO9IEaWNYy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nocturnus Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Strangers are always welcome to stay for dinner","title":"What happened - No one knows","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
