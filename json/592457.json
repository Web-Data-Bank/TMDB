Zoey Brooks (Jamie Lynn Spears) decides to be one of the first girls to become a student at Pacific Coast Academy. Very exciting, but also very scary. Fitting in at a new school is hard enough, but going away to a boarding school and living on your own at age 13 can get crazy, especially when the girls are heavily outnumbered by the boys. The main DVD program will feature a double length episode plus two bonus episodes.","popularity":3.744,"poster_path":"/dy7iSZUnSYaS6ghzK6EDenT3MAv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19528,"logo_path":null,"name":"ApolloProScreen Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":12237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schneiders Bakery","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The First Ever Zoey 101 T.V.
