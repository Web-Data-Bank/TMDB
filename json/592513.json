Traveling from nation to nation for years, she is accompanied only by a wolf, Fenrir. Together they must evade the assassins sent by the Sect - who'll stop at nothing to complete the task they failed to achieve many years ago. Her past is shrouded in mystery, as even Riese can't recall the events of the tragic night when her entire family was slaughtered and she was forced to flee into the wilderness. On her journey, she'll piece together her past, and her destiny, in a conflict that will hold the fate of the world in the balance - and the once peaceful kingdom of Eleysia will be the battlefield.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eHawOn8J02bXmSF3HB8WfTG79gM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riese: Kingdom Falling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
