She shares them with Rosalee, a smart and perky teenager; Timee, a flamboyant, puerile youth, who wears women’s clothing; an old lady, a habitué of museums; and a dozen of others. Karen’s official diagnosis is Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Through personal stories, “Busy Inside” delves deeply into DID — a condition that fascinates and puzzles modern psychiatry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wvCs0Gm8B0xjdR5SdWkHFWeWa1B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150972,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diplodocus Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Busy Inside","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
