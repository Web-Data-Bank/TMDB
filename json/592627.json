Characters of the movie- kingly names, but in dull souls of the slaves. They are freaks, obsessed with various complexes and manias. Weak, puny people that face the most unusual, paradoxical situations, where they never end up as winners. They don’t take up what the Fortune offers them. They don’t change the world. However….. Under circumstances, they get the opportunity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7iv8SVj7tlEWCYDGZLiDCY9LehB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brotherhood of Pate","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
