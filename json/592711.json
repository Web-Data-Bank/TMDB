He is accompanied by his former student and biographer in this journey, with whom he shares a complex relationship. As the disease continues to corrode his body and mind, the professor has to grapple with a memory that eludes him, regrets that haunt him and questions that he is yet to find answers to.

With the ghosts of his past resurfacing and the present turning into a nightmare, is it too late for him to seek redemption?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xTRTCS8lOrKZSJ17aaehFdxvD3J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Certain lives in Twilight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
