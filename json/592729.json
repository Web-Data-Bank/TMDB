Palestine creates a kind of composite instrument in motion as well as an \"articulated personal drama\". His stated desire for escape is contained by the boundaries of the island. Palestine was a trained cantor, and he often used his moving body and sustained vocalizing to generate a physical and aural intensity in his musical/video performances of this period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jOsnWYnefZbKwwtXwYILL5oUcpw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island Song","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
