An athletics competition and a lost Walkman set in motion a chain of events that will mark the lives of a group of friends, rivals and enemies forever. Shy, wealthy Qian, extrovert Cheng, troubled Su, academically gifted Wang, charismatic athlete Teng Xiao and student president Yang are all linked in a web of friendships and hatreds, secrets, violent conflicts and passionate attachments. None emerges unscarred, and some of the wounds run deep. Years later, a series of encounters draw them back together, but the shadow of the past hangs heavy. Can they redeem themselves – and exorcise the ghosts of their youth – or is tragedy inevitable?","popularity":0.947,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2019-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where It Begins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
