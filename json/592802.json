From the rooftop you can see the whole city. It is  summer. On the roof is a group of refugees from Syria. The depth below reminds them of  the depth of the sea. Above them is only sky. On this roof, they feel like they are back on  their journey across the Mediterranean - lost on a small rubber boat. They begin to  reenact the most dramatic situation they have survived during their flight: crossing the  Mediterranean between Turkey and Greece. They try several times but the Turkish Coast  Guard prevents them. During an attempt, water begins to swamp the boat - the refugees  save themselves by swimming for hours.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qrX0Lp1pOrWfOOWVqEJzVJX3Y72.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
