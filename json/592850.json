A play takes place, where no text is written but where everyone knows his role on the fingertips. The actors, since distant times, have all the same suit: a black blouse and a cane. During this short lapse of time, they are going to confront themselves, to flee, to catch, to tap on the shoulder, to laugh and to have a row, to love and to hate themselves. These actors of a moment are the traders in cattle of the market of Laissac.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iiNe6bXh7lxMWHLp81EO5A2fXcR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Négociant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
