A place that the film never quits, except for a few seconds out on a stretch of pavement, as the credits open. One or two shots are enough to establish the exterior and remind us of the hostility of some nearby residents – the glimpse of a board tied to a window: “No to the drug injection room”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mT7bCbop1tE8X34eZ9WrXfH1rDN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76117,"logo_path":"/6GBfBiE0nz6kgkNdTku3ls8ZYii.png","name":"Look at Sciences","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here I'm Not Gonna Die","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
