They both boast about their loving sons but in reality, one had just escaped a retirement home and the other was looking for an escape from her son and daughter-in-law. With nowhere to go, the two wander around, befriending a cosmetics salesman and a kind waitress who give them beer. This biting social satire starring two memorable grandmothers, scripted by Yôko Mizuki, picked up on Japan’s aging population problem far ahead of its time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xFHu6J39AQ1pEdvNzshYY41nw4c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124672,"logo_path":null,"name":"M.
