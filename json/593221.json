In three insightful conversations with female friends, collaborators and high school students, the director looks for a discourse about fear that is not fearsome, a discourse on violence that is not violent.  Direct cinema, horizontal process, self-criticism and narrative breaks. Mostly, this is a tale of universal sorority.","popularity":0.909,"poster_path":"/ASbBYqHItSmtFVl7gKtnFKZhHG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walkie Talkie Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All the Women I Know","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
