With no official documentation they find themselves unable to cover the medical fees and Dorj must pawn their wedding belongings before signing up to a local karaoke contest. A heart- warming and feel-good road movie about the clash between nature and the urban world. Out of Paradise is as much a love story as a reflection on our modern ways of living.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oNnEZxaBINe2Ct9kcs1gmAmrEGR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":10259,"logo_path":null,"name":"Look Now","origin_country":""},{"id":116775,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hesse Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MN","name":"Mongolia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
