But she doesn't care as she informs Li'l Abner that she has a new suitor, Disgustin' Jones, cousin of Available Jones. He takes a train, airplane, ocean liner and gets as far as the Egypitian pyramids before he realizes what she told him and, while Abner doesn't want the delectable Miss Scragg---at least as drawn in the comic strip---he ain't hankerin' fer anybody else to be wooing her, and he returns to Dogpatch to put an end to any hanky-panky that might be going on in them thar hills. But Disgustin', disgusting character that he is, has about a thousand bodyguards hired to keep Abner away. They do but, then Mammy Yokum, takes a hand and quickly makes short work of the bodyguards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3287,"logo_path":"/bz6GbCQQXGNE56LTW9dwgksW0Iw.png","name":"Screen Gems","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Pee-kool-yar Sit-chee-ay-shun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
