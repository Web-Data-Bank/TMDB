SWANS has always been a collection of singular performers, but there's been one constant since its formation in 1982--singer, songwriter Michael Gira. 'Where Does a Body End?' is a SWANS documentary with unfettered access to hundreds of hours of Gira/SWANS archives of never-seen-before recordings, videos, and photographs. An unfiltered story of a life in the arts, frequent difficulty spanning decades without a safety net, creating work because Gira says \"What else am I going to do?\"","popularity":1.183,"poster_path":"/1dqXCynVLkOWaZZ8R17bSuQuXwf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116858,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eyelight Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Michael is not a fearless person, but he is a fearless artist.\"","title":"Swans: Where Does a Body End?","video":false,"vote_average":7.714,"vote_count":7}
