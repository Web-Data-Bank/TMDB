The different locations include a reservoir, for which Faoro has a particular lineal affection, a cemetery in the Bronx where his ancestors were buried, and a slaughterhouse in upstate New York. Consequently, the film explores themes of family, death and the loss of innocence. In doing so, it creates a concentrated rhythm and familiar cyclical pattern of movement; both of which result in a subconscious pursuit of the inevitable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hPeQYs591cHesZuCGVJQdtLVo1g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Melody of Decomposition","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
