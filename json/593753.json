The photograph, taken at night, features an empty street in Philadelphia. Street lamps glow, light subtly reflected in the asphalt below. As Guzzetti traces the origins of the image, a tender portrait of his father comes into focus. What was and what could have been are inexplicably entwined in one static shot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hGzvFdHfc6oGJJnTmLoZE64Nt5O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Exposure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
