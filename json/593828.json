In the film branches of magnolia extend into the empty cavity of the cello, the space where sound resonates.” (JP)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oblique","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
