Situated on the edgeland between city and countryside in the transient landscape of the Thames Estuary, this is a place layered with the traces of ever-shifting global narratives of empire, industry and movement of people and goods. Anastassiou explores how this pocket of nature is contained and consumed by focusing on the figure of the bird watcher. The film follows a walk from day to night along the inner and outer peripheries of the reserve, shot on a hand-cranked 16mm camera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kleep-toowit, klip klip, too-ow-wit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
