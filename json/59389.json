But he is haunted by the memory of a recent car crash and hounded by his estranged wife and her demands for divorce. Slowly, a festering insanity takes over and unwilling to face the outside world he embarks on a lunatic experiment. Confining himself to his middle-class home, he eschews contact with others and survives entirely off 'food' which he can find in his house. Based on JG Ballard's The Enormous Space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d4VZ0CsJMtOPqKpILvMJYLSKDYs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
