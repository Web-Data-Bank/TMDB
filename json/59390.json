Now, he's a successful senator running for president and she's an award-winning children's author. They may clash on some political issues, but they can agree on one thing: they're falling in love. Aggie isn't sure she's ready to become anyone's first lady, let alone the country's but she's soon seduced by the smiling senator and introduced as his bride-to-be to the nation. Unfortunately for the White House hopefuls, someone has film footage of Aggie from the Nixon Years, showing her in a series of compromising positions which could compromise Hugh's chances of winning. Will the two running mates ruin into in a brick wall â€” or will love conquer all before election day?","popularity":1.128,"poster_path":"/xQxz5gvKVIoBcfJO7N4IjScLdZ7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7429,"logo_path":"/6in9uMqxXEHx5XgYgkeRBpZ4rPw.png","name":"HBO Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's got a bright political future.
