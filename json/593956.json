Contributing factors to Taylorâ€™s wrongful conviction included a rushed police investigation, evidence that was withheld from defense attorneys and misleading testimony that was presented to the jury. In 2010, after Taylor spent 16 years in prison for a crime that he did not commit, the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission dismissed the murder charge against him and he walked out of prison a free and innocent man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dATUPGOe6NxPWccCaYagFYpVUZT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Captiol Broadcasting Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6,149 Days","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
