From time control with frame shooting to gaze fix with live action filming, her technology and texture change greatly. This first work in video indeed straightforwardly defines the relationship between \"living space\" and \"physicality\". Through repetition of thundering and quietude, the power of Nishioka's pure solitude and intense observation turn and reshape the warmhearted town of Osaka into something hard and inorganic. The adherence to a suddenly rising unrealistic and gigantic vapor pillar, the ever-turning ventilation fan and the ever-watching eye – All of these are ways to love Osaka permissible only to this filmmaker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jCgeD5N5lalBZtkjk6mDPzu0WAP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Voyant Cinémathèque","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bristlecornpine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
