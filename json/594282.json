In English, La Guerre oubliée means The Forgotten War. Here, we talk about the 1914-18 big thing. This documentary doesn't use old footage, but actors to show us some parts of that war in Quebec. Joe Bocan sings some songs of that period and makes the narrations. There's also some rare veterans of the war who talk.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nfP4ghMro56tnjfUPZ2RIO0Bn1k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Vent d'Est","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1988-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forgotten War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
