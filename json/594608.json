For four years, from 2006-2009, filmmaker Martin Bell and photographer Mary Ellen Mark travelled around the country and documented proms.  They went to twelve high schools in 10 cities, covering a wide range of ethnic and economic groups.  While Mary Ellen Mark made portraits of the Prom-goers with the 20x24 Polaroid camera, Martin Bell interviewed the students in an adjacent studio.  When the project finally came to a close, Bell had interviewed over three hundred students.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aCzZtjcqIES9kBKEzgG7UuGybGW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
