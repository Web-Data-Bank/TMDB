This piece is triggered by the shocking news of his death. Though launched with such reason, other than Akemi Edo's still photo shot in the opening of the film, there is no sign of directly grieving the singer's death. What evolves is Yanase's impoverished poetry overlapping a view of a town cut into tiny pieces. \"The eyes were married\", \"My life is long\", \"From here to there. Here here here here...\". The repeated typing of words that seem to be squeezed out of the unconscious shows a strange unity with Akemi Edo's live concerts – conveying funky loneliness – and intrigues the souls of the viewers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hahKHaaIRKQnJySS00w4jt6NkUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Voyant Cinémathèque","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the flower blooms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
