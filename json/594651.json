Responding to the tiniest light, a total stranger in an lien town, Aoi's vision and camera keep on wandering through downtown alleys. By controlling time, he discovers a new way of existence in \"light\", and his brisk solitude can be felt all over the screen. Aoi's true masterpiece – turning a perfectly ordinary daily scene into a completely extrinsic object, this unique tone and texture have received high praise in and out of Japan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aUARQj8UHIGh2U1o1WGfIb8LLIB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Voyant Cinémathèque","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
