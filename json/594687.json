This is one of the most extreme challenges a human being can face. The sailors are alone at sea for months and physical and emotional strength are essential. Growlers (Icebergs), sea mammals, and massive waves are a constant danger. On any day the forces of nature can bring an end to the best sailor's well made plans. They harness the wind, hope for safe passage over the sea and push hard to win. They are a testament to the audacity of the human spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pxvh23AhLLUSRWMFQ5k82dFeDRN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miz Monday Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":117061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Resolve Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Racing Around the World Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
