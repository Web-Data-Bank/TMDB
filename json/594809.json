What was meant by the lost “Golden Age?” Why did ancient sky worshipers refer to Saturn as “the sun?” Why was Venus worshiped as the “Mother Goddess?” And why did both Old and New World astronomers celebrate the planet Mars as a great warrior whose battles shook the heavens?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aeaabDvJBR1lQ5rpGntlQa1ReV7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A video documentary that could change everything you thought you knew about planetary history.","title":"Mythscape: Remembering The End Of The World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
