Cosmopolitan, resourceful young men from the Ukraine, the Philippines, from Ghana or Trinidad, enticed by the slogan “See the world for free” and the promise of a job! For ten months, the film follows these new globalised sailors across the oceans while they gain experience and cope with the isolation. They communicate in “Globish”, a sort of scattered, heavily accented English and look towards Andrei, the “chief mate” from the Ukraine, a central figure on board.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6OigurCLgrF1Uvgo23UiqzfhBWC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La mer est mon royaume","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
