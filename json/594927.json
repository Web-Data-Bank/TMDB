KAROO COWBOY tells the intimate story of Seun Beukes, 29, a descendant of the San Bushman living in one of the most arid places on earth but where, once upon a time, his ancestors existed in perfect harmony with nature. He loves nothing more than being out on the veld and, in the evening, studying old westerns as he tries to learn the intricacies of riding horses and herding cattle. In a way of life that is unique to this desolate corner of the Rainbow Nation, Seun reconciles the contradictions of his people's past with his own present and sets his hopes for the future upon his young daughter who is just starting school. But this year's unprecedented drought has reached a new record and in the anticipation of providential rain the pressure mounts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ol7jmkRozDi2rRXFK8ZzKoDSySn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karoo Cowboy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
