To break away from their daily routine, run-down infrastructure and troublesome clients, they may come to sing in the company choir once a week. The folk and patriotic songs they practice at rehearsals become a bridge between the past communist era and the new political and economic reality. They help them to deal with the shock of transformation and simply spend some time together, just like in the good old times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k3ImSj62InrwPF3c03xdDwvWqcM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phalanstery Films","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heat Singers","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":3}
