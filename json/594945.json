That of Malek, the filmmaker’s father, who for years said nothing of his childhood in Algeria. And then, the need to break the silence, with a script that he gives to his children, to start telling his story. Several years later, the father and daughter finally make the journey to Mansourah, his native village: seeing his house, meeting other men who experienced the same heartbreak. Little by little, the film reveals what Malek, like many others, has long kept quiet about.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3FvFZgag5o3drUT0ICzDCaqTYGS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Bilboquet","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":110998,"logo_path":null,"name":"HKE Production","origin_country":""},{"id":71793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sonntag Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Mansourah You Separated Us","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
