Little known at home but a superstar abroad, Sean flies around the world to open 15 major museum exhibitions - a journey that also reveals his extraordinary life story.  Now, at the age of 73, Scully opens up about his unique experiences spanning 55 years in an often hostile art world - how he built a reputation from nothing, having grown up penniless on the streets of Dublin and London, often homeless as a child and running with street gangs as a teenager, to turn his striped paintings into the huge success they are today.","popularity":0.678,"poster_path":"/hPFdJFsTsJB6e2BD3SshXFIcK2t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unstoppable: Sean Scully and the Art of Everything","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
