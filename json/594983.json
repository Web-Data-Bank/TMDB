This documentary takes a glimpse behind the make-up, wigs and corsets to find out what it takes to live a life in drag, why people do it and the daily battles drag queens still face, following three queens at different stages in their drag careers.  Barbara La Bush, the self-proclaimed ‘oldest queen in Glasgow’, represents traditional end-of-the-pier drag. She must come to terms with ailing health and the insecurity of a working life spent on the clubs and pubs circuit. Lawrence Chaney, part of the Instagram generation of highly looks-focused performers, seeks approval from a mainstream culture that is out of her comfort zone. And new queen Voss must battle the prejudices of a job in the merchant navy as well as gain parental acceptance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qayrcF1aaWKUE0yyjWsOlPYg1Gi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary that finds out what it takes to live a life in drag, following three queens at different stages in their drag careers.","title":"Mother Tuckers: Drag Queens of Glasgow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
