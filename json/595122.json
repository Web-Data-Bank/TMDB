Black Man’s Houses tells a dramatic story of the quest by Aboriginal people to reclaim the graves of their ancestors against a background of racism and denial. Documenting a moving memorial re-enactment of the funeral of the great chief Manalargenna, the film also charts the cultural strength and resilience of his descendants as they are forced to fight for recognition in a society that is not ready to remember the terrible events of the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xngYalxi3GseUxBsoAs3M3qM4lt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Channel Co-Operative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1993-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Man's Houses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
