He is drafted into the A.E.F. when World War I breaks out, and accidentally captures a nest of German snipers, and is decorated for bravery. He returns home as a hero but Vance, the town bully, challenges him to a fight but Barry refuses and the townsmen mock him and consider him a coward. His girlfriend Janet is none too impressed, either. He heads for the tall timber with suicide as his intent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zcvQxUDbxOgSz7Lb8EhCQqNBydg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
