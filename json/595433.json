In Plazuela, a peaceful hamlet lost in a mountainous region of Ecuador, only a handful of old ladies remain, who are all widows. In the gloom of their houses, photos of those who are gone hang on walls: husbands who have passed away a few years earlier, children gone to work in the big cities or abroad, and grandchildren who have grown up far away from them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3TEIZKfgjze7AcjO1bgKEeQiZPD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Consejo Nacional de Cinematografía del Ecuador","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2019-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When They Left","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
