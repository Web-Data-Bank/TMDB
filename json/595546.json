Even though they fight relentlessly, they keep losing. One day, though, things change. Everything seems to be possible again. But will the team be able to keep up the momentum? Delphine Gleize films this sports odyssey with humour and passion. She is the only woman in the locker room and the men talk to her as if she were one of them. Through her camera, getting close while keeping an observational distance, the filmmaker manages to capture elements that define and clarify male bonds and relationships.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eUyDyuKmsBDu8RtKsk9PXnPlmhV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great Expectations","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
