The journey produced a unique documentary film and a travelogue. A hundred years later director Kira Jääskeläinen returns to the Bering Strait in Pälsi's footsteps. Combining old and new film footage, Pälsi's notes and the stories of the local indigenous peoples, the film highlights the story of the Chukchi and Siberian Eskimos from bygone days till today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bN7zPPT6HIEi916jx0SLR5OKIhD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illume","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northern Travelogues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
