By far his most personal work to date.  About the show - 'Houdini's right-hand man deals with the death of his boss. A half-century later, a Blackpool joke shop proprietor takes on a wide-eyed young protege. An affectionate look at a misspent youth and unsung heroes. Not a magic show, but magical nonetheless.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Aioy0vj6ILV6KHshUzVEKJewfI9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A love letter to a Blackpool magic shop","title":"Linking Rings","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
