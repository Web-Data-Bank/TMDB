Madame de Dumeval, the Duke de Tesis and the Duke de Wand, libertines expelled from the puritanical court of Louis XVI, seek the support of the legendary Duc de Walchen, German seducer and freethinker, lonely in a country where hypocrisy and false virtue reign. Their mission is to export libertinage, a philosophy of enlightenment founded on the rejection of moral boundaries and authorities, but moreover to find a safe place to pursue their errant games, where the quest for pleasure no longer obeys laws other than those dictated by unfulfilled desires.","popularity":3.27,"poster_path":"/6r9NoFRNbWMA9vXWHrgqE4wsIZp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":2606,"logo_path":"/2KJaKgKrsJE3JXpp2pf2TQpxomf.png","name":"Idéale Audience","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13720,"logo_path":"/wqBR878P0PvPAEWE8xxG8VkHP8i.png","name":"Andergraun Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":45489,"logo_path":"/h9pjnrYbpEqWwPZDEyJfUzHFCG9.png","name":"Lupa Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liberté","video":false,"vote_average":5.462,"vote_count":26}
