These peoples of the Skeena River exist in two worlds. Ancient totem poles tower against the mountains and the forests, old graveyards reveal fragments of shared history, and traditional crafts are still practiced on the reserves. But in the school games, in a wedding complete with white veil and white rice, and in the sawmill, we see how other ways of life are being adopted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1949-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peoples of the Skeena","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
