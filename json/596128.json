Near the Sevillian town of El Palmar de Troya, in 1968, people begin to say that the Virgin appears and the two friends take advantage of the situation. Soon a network of economic interests and credulity is created that makes it easier for Manuel and Clemente to achieve their goal: a monumental basilica, a religious order of nuns, priests and bishops of their own, and even a pope, Gregory XVII. Satire on the curious origin of the Palmarian Catholic Church and its unique founders.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/jia5X2eiJ3DbHyCaheontpAvC7q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Javier Palmero P.C.","origin_country":""},{"id":117295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Margen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1986-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manuel y Clemente","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
