Narrated by Dominic West, this incredible documentary looks back to the very early days of the pandemic when there were no medications and a positive HIV test meant almost certain death. Many of those featured have never spoken openly to the media about those traumatic early days, and this may be the only time they will do so. The film features interviews with the actor Jonathan Blake (portrayed in the film Pride by Dominic West) who has lived with the virus for over thirty years. This frank and important movie features moving interviews about a desperate time that the world must never forget. It beautifully commemorates those lost to AIDS, it celebrates those who supported people living with the virus and the many who continue to be there for those in need. AFTER 82 is a remarkable testament to human compassion, strength, love and resilience and ensures that those voices will never be forgotten.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q0XelxSGYJGAyCvj4NlFdxvmPNH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154371,"logo_path":null,"name":"82 films","origin_country":""},{"id":154372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virtuous Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Untold Story of the AIDS Crisis in the UK","title":"After 82","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
