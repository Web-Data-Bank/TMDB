This way, the number of people exposed to virus transmission increases. Silence is not the solution. The story depicted in the film revolves around the presence of HIV/AIDS in Poland. It deliberates over tolerance and social attitude towards this problem, over openness and eventually anxiety. People living with the virus and those who live in ignorance saying “But that doesn’t apply to me” both fall victim’s to this anxiety.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ohEiUEGw3EPliajnpjxZWqdGZob.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HIV in Polish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
