But what about intersex people who do not fit into either category? Since Vincent Guillot, as an adult, discovered the word that defines him —intersexual – he has never stopped looking for people like him in an urgent quest to understand himself. The German women artist Ins A Kromminga realised that she was different as a teenager. Born and raised as a girl, her body began to acquire male characteristics in puberty. Her eloquent drawings speak of the trauma that is inflicted on intersex people. With joyful determination and a great sense of humour, the characters in Régine Abadia’s documentary fight for the emancipation of a minority that is invisible and beaten and bruised by life. Their problem: medicine, which intervenes not only to treat, but also to adapt bodies to rigid female or male norms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hrtJYwfrIbersh4kEQ0klxpNCeS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intersex","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
