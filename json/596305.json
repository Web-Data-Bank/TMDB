It is a model law in the world since it enables the change of document and sex assignment without the need of any operation, simply by manifesting the self-perceived sex. Still today, in more than eighty countries in the world, any type of sexual practice other than heterosexual is criminalized and in some cases even condemned with the death penalty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iFLYvG9m7AXTCztKZ2dcHaeVvqH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nosotros, el documental","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
