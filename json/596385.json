Valery Gergiev provides a quite good performance, as he uses to do, and the stage presents very brilliant moments, for example, the impressive image of Turandot, especially when filmed from the bottom of the scene by the expert Brian Large. Cristina Gallardo Domas as Liu clearly outcomes in this cast although I cannot help mentioning my favourite Liu, Monserrat Caball√©. She did set a so high standard for this role that further performances slightly get to approach her. Good Calaf and Turandot and perhaps a not very remarkable Ping, Pang, Pong trio.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rl7ghLQzwERXS0LPw6fX0vALfKy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":29639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salzburger Festspiele","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turandot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
