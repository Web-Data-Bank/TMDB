A space that’s not always provided in the daily life of the kindergarten, as the film casually suggests even after it was toned down by the DEFA censors: toilets without doors, ghastly birthday parties and friendly but unmistakable reprimands when the children let too much dialect slip into the grammar exercise or when their pictures of soldiers are not realistic enough.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4ui1ACN1cj6fOsioS5rLHWXc5Yw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA Studio für Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1987-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once I Was a Child","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
