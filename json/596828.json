In a hopeless move, he hires a very famous thug / fighter for protection: Sahin, nicknamed \"Deli\" (Mad). Sahin's reputation is so intimidating that the news of him being hired causes a distress in Mr. Abbas's rivals, even before he appears in town. Things are looking up for Mr. Abbas. However, the welcome committee waiting for Sahin's arrival are shocked and disappointed at what they see: He's a bum who can hardly stand, with a bottle in his hand at all times instead of a gun. The plot is loosely based on Cat Ballou (1965).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hcejoidp1zGrZJA6yVjt7kLdQXE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1385,"logo_path":"/l04VbeoDrr3AbOnhopcfLnA1Tjl.png","name":"Acar Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1976-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deli Şahin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
