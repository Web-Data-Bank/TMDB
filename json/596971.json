He was a young physician with a promising future, until his medical error caused the death of a big-shot politician. He was discharged from the hospital and had since sailed around the world as an on-board doctor. As he was about to reach the Taiwanese piers of Kinmon Island, thoughts of his days in Japan crossed his mind - he reminisced about the Taiwanese girl, Yan, who had scooped him out of his misery during the time of the medical accident. At times of war, the two rekindle an old flame.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/6yN3UubSDFrCTocX2HpPmuErs4T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":955,"logo_path":"/5xnXD3PJI1HqOJceSAKZ3fDqO1V.png","name":"Nikkatsu Corporation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":25345,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Motion Picture Corporation","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1962-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rainbow Over Kinmon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
