Mykki Blanco is portrayed in tasks that test the limits of the body, physical stress, and the boundaries of normative health. STONES & WATER WEIGHT is an exercise in how societies perceive the fragilities of those who survive with the virus. In this era of globalized fitness culture through the use of social media, “looking healthy” matters much more than actually being healthy. Using endurance as the motivation for the performance, the video creates a new perception of HIV+ people as strong and resilient. Research references include the Atlas myth, the god of endurance who holds the earth and the skies over his shoulders, and the neverending climb of Sisyphus.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vDWXo5eZkhbP3uUvVop1JbltEOz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"STONES & WATER WEIGHT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
