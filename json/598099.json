Everything as usual in the Fukuoka city. Some places in Japan have already been scorched by the fire of war, but here it is relatively peaceful and calm. The school still working, and the boys play war in their spare time. Daichi and his friend are the commanders of rival squads. One day a newcomer appears in the class - Yoriko, a girl evacuated from Tokyo. Yoriko takes life very seriously, she has good reasons - her childhood ended after the loss of loved ones in the bombing. Children get to know each other and become friends. They, as the rest of the city, do not yet know that on June 19 their life will be divided into \"before\" and \"after\".","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/cBYiyHe4EVLLjPrdf0gBIvQEfmP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20327,"logo_path":"/drfbo2T51CU0gvV5PWCre19P8nG.png","name":"Mushi Production","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1988-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raining Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
