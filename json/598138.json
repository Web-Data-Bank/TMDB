Hammer was invited to have a retrospective in summer, 1994, at the first Gay and Lesbian film festival on the African continent. She wanted to do more than screen her films and videos; she wanted to teach video production skills in the townships. These workshops provide the deeply moving stories lesbians and gays told to one another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qjzouY9PV5QNfVWQCf1DEWlm2lH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out in South Africa","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
