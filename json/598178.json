Part doc-, part mock-umentary (see if you can tell which is which!), FtF explores the variations of femme identity.  Interviews with famous femmes, including Guinivere Turner, Bitch and Leslie Mah (from Tribe 8) are interspersed with scenes from a parodic consciousness-raising group.  FtF asks a lot of hard questions like “Does wearing a push-up bra make one a bad feminist?”  Sub-genres such as the retro femme, fat femme, tomboy femme, punk femme, and high femme are all given their due.  FtF is a savvy, defiant documentary that’ll make you laugh, make you think and make you want to dismantle the patriarchy, while in stilettos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fadHMBcBTW959ez0ebSfvWVrUZA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FtF: Female to Femme","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
