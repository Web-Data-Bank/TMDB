Shake Dance is a documentary that takes viewers to a number of strip clubs in the Atlanta area, where some of the nation's best shake dancers show off their moves and talk about their jobs; some regard what they do as an art form and a means of personal expression, while others just look at dancing as a fast way to make a buck. Shake Dance features music from a handful of the South's leading dance music acts, including 95 South, Quad City Family, and 69 Boyz.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gy1ojEgXCoZB7Wu78cmEUH0z5bD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xenon Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shake Dance: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
