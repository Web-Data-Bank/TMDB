She became such after she received a concussion and a leg injury. Now she limps and sees the world far from rosy. Zhenya blames his best (and now former) friend Prikhodka for his injury and directs all his anger and sparkling cynicism at him. But apart from Prikhodko, everyone gets it: parents, older brother, girlfriends and classmates. Everything changes when Zhenya meets the head of the robotics circle, Stanislav Karin, who becomes her mentor. Through interaction with robots, Zhenya learns to communicate with people, enjoys life, and most importantly, forgives and regains an old friend.","popularity":3.095,"poster_path":"/upGGCt4TeZdaAECKLp1fe9TFl2z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15755,"logo_path":"/cZDbkvJPOnzHlmu2CDx05DcEnaf.png","name":"Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":103137,"logo_path":null,"name":"QS Films","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tin Head","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
