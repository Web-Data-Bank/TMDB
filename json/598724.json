Amidst ecstatic water balloon fights, opulent feasts devoured without utensils, narrations of pleasure, lewd hand gestures, densely scored orgies, improvisational performance, and intense kink dynamics, (W/HOLE) proposes a new type of pornography: a world of queer sex that is at once surreally lush and intensely real. The film celebrates queer pleasure as resistance, while inviting viewers of all identities towards their own human capacity for pleasure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oaTbZkOxEW4ZHn2fMlLuqkjJhkI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(W/Hole)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
