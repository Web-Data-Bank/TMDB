Just over 300 in attendance. It is quite sad to me that despite increased exposure for women's wrestling that women's only shows still draw massively smaller numbers than the men's shows. This is the first SEAdLINNNG show I've seen. They start off by having 25 minutes of talking in a studio. It's odd. Skip in 33 minutes for the actual show start.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":16233,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seadlinnng Shin: Kiba 3rd Night","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
