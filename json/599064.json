The booking went all over the place here with very strange choices (dynamic of some matches, nine matches in a two-hour show, Niya vs. Nevaeh which does not take place here \"because of reasons\", Tessa Blanchard in babyface , and especially THE FUCKING OFFICE), but everything is not negative with the anniversary show which is already full (Nevaeh vs. Niya, Blanchard vs. Stephie, Juicy Product vs. Athena vs. Hania in a TLC match) and some interesting beginnings / returns (Blanchard even though she is babyface and Bates). Let's hope that the next show will raise the bar because this new regime is not very fascinating at the moment. 08.11.2014","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":23113,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WSU Breaking Barriers III","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
