We have the sequel and end of the tournament for the Spirit Title, defending the team titles against the Dollhouse of pas-Mia Yim and not-Marti Belle, and finally Cherry Bomb defends its title for the first time against Tessa Blanchard. This show begins - with a promo of the Office. We have a sudden break from the beginning, then Stephie announces that Allysin Kay is not present and that Hania replaces her in the tournament because why not. Yeah, I do not know if it was planned or not, but it is perhaps time not to book Kay who magnifies a show on two (she was at a house show of GFW instead). She also announces that Shanna has not been able to move and that Cataldo is left without a match, but music sounds and here it is. In short, he gets excited for a moment and wants a match against Stephie for later that she accepts.
