We create our own feeling of loneliness and feel as though we are living our lives unnoticed, when in reality it is quite the opposite. We build up these emotions and often times take it out on those around us, expecting things to change. But is it the people around us, or is it ourselves that must change? Sometimes, the only black sheep that we claim exists, is the one within our own minds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fmWFHrTr4qTzz2SznWFEbl77lfV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The only black sheep that we claim exists, is the one within our own minds.","title":"Black Sheep","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
