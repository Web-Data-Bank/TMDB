Shot in the style of a thriller, this observational film combines the look and feel of a narrative feature film with a real life revelatory journalistic investigation into a campaign of killings. The film uncovers a murky world where crime, drugs and politics meet in a deathly embrace - and reveal that although the police have been publicly ordered to stop extra-judicial killings, the deaths continue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6CjAxc9raRWoCA5iQBR1SQf2qq0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the President's Orders","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6}
