Gordon Murray comes the 1959 Holiday classic Santa Claus. Made in Mexico and dubbed into glorious English, Santa Claus tells the story of, well, Santa Claus, who lives in a big white castle above us in Geosynchronous Orbit and watches over us all in a way that would make the NSA jealous. It’s Christmas Eve, and on Earth poor little Lupita wishes for a doll. Santa hears her wish and prepares for his yearly visit, helped by the heavily medicated Merlin the Wizard and Santa’s unintentionally creepy mechanical reindeer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5qKrLmi1gY7sr2fQiZoSET6UOVQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RiffTrax Live: Santa Claus","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
