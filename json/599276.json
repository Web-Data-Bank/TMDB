Starting the show with a crazy brawl definitely set the tone for the rest of the night. There's not a single bad match on this card (the opener served its purpose) and the main event was an outstanding contest. Highly recommended show.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hOQr3bGfAja7B7p6bk1HVMEnINc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118180,"logo_path":"/gTEbqOLuwGCzn6rYUTLMLuArk2K.png","name":"World Wonder Ring Stardom","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-01-05","revenue":44355,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stardom New Years Stars  Tag 3 (Evening Show)","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
