Bar Wrestling is the new company of Joey Ryan, founded last year and has so far 20 events under his belt. It stands out for being simply wrestling, in fact they still do not have titles, and as its name says, it is usually done in a bar (this is done in a theater). The fans are on the edge of the ring in a way very similar to how is Beyond Wrestling or the Irish OTT Wrestling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/syWSSscxX429CLc54c40ygUTtRa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115910,"logo_path":"/urrDHmKuK94yZbS2hAtfn2351dc.png","name":"Bar Wrestling","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-03","revenue":43327,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bar Wrestling 20: Ain't My First Rodeo Drive!","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
