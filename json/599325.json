But Ray's gotten used to it. In fact, he’s been using his banana-based infamy as a way to evangelize even more. Last year, he wrote a book, hoping that would provide some much needed context to his banana bit — it didn’t — and now he’s made this movie documenting the same thing. The problem with the entire routine, though, is that taking an hour to explain a horrible analogy doesn’t work when your starting point is a horrible analogy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2J0QZ4j8jYOpe2gzCSYIQImIXod.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The True \"Banana Man\" Story","title":"The Fool","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
