Just as she and her band get a residency at a prestigious theater in the city, the boyfriend she's mad about coldly announces that he doesn't love her any more. The film is punctuated by intense bursts of tango. Every song moves the story along, providing an insight into the characters and access to the protagonist's feelings: nostalgia, passion, sadness, and joy in turn. The lyrical and musical wealth of tango, brilliantly performed by Eugenia Ramírez Miori, unites the two stories, past and present. 'La cantante de tango' is a poignant auteur film about a woman trying to get back on her feet after a devastating break-up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dJfLwz4TVI7wW29HEqKMiSyARpx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trivial Media","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":113022,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mobilis Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12583,"logo_path":"/vnYEkRJgZ9w1ZL777SGNqNV74b8.png","name":"Minds Meet","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":34602,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Productie","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tango Singer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
