We are alone but at the same time we keep constantly contact with the world. The city feeds this dual mobility - physical and virtual - through a variety of situations, routines and rhythms in our everyday life. Spaces deeply encoded and propitious to individualism and indifference, transform us in spectators of places where no one is truly part of.  This film is about this state of loneliness, about ambiguity and disorientation, darkness and silence. A space between confusion, chaos and liberation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mSWjFR06ClVmOLdU5ZzZET4OgXh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"在中间 IN BETWEEN 在中間","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
