In Les 4 Saisons d'Espigoule, Philibert returns to the town where he grew up (and left when he was 25) to film the residents for a year. In addition to capturing Espigoule's annual Goat Rodeo and New Year's Eve costumes, the audience gets an inside look at the backbone of the local economy (sheep herding) and a night of big excitement (a bingo match). We also meet a few of the locals, who show off their talents (painting, classical piano, imitating Liza Minnelli). While scripted in advance by Philibert, the film was indeed shot in his hometown, and the \"actors\" playing the citizens of Espigoule actually do live there.","popularity":1.525,"poster_path":"/4QOPwu5CvSf8PGGFlLbn9CZedkl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72654,"logo_path":"/qAGfpZE53RKgPWyiWYnIUdzpPrb.png","name":"Lardux films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les 4 saisons d'Espigoule","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":11}
