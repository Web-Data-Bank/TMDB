He fell into a sea of depression and self-medication before deciding it was time to do something drastic. Three weeks later, he was on the Pacific Crest Trail. He’s gone on to hike his way to recovery. His trail name? It’s Akuna, as in hakuna matata — or no worries. “I try not to worry about anything on trail. I do that in my normal life … Every mile I hike it seems like I bring more of Akuna back home with me.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stept Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":11124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stept Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Akuna","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
