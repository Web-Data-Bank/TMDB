My favourite game was to dress up as a resistant. But one day, I discovered that in 1944, in the name of God and Brittany, my great uncles Job and Pierre, fervent Breton nationalists, joined the \"Bezen Perrot\" militia and fought against the Resistance, wearing the SS uniform. Today, after several years of research, I take the road, traveling in the footsteps of my ancestors, from Brittany to Germany and Ireland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6t49o64tn6Ig1URAlbT6HerMHbO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La découverte ou l'ignorance","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
