If a baby kangaroo leaves his pouch at a certain moment, the handicapped child stays longer in the lap of his/her mother. Then the stake is, when does one dare to gently push him/her out? For his/her part, the child also has to prove to the mother that (s)he can become independent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ichYFNJGGhX3Tog8hNxib76UkOf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kangaroo Complex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
