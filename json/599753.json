Here, text from the original video exploring the intersections and conflicts between electronic media and the creation/reception of new media art is dissected into individual words that are then pair with split-second images and sound clips. Further, the original soundtrack has been removed and replaced with a more conventional, drum-and-base like soundtrack; the sequence of words-and-images has been sped up; and a Japanese speaker now presents a vocal accompaniment to the text.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26609,"logo_path":null,"name":"CNAP/Image-Mouvement","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Theory Remix","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
