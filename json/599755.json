Here, the duo record a performance by a singer dealing in the profound social and cultural effects that television has had on modern human life. Images of the musician - over-saturated and recorded at a lower frame rate but duped at normal speed - are only apparent when he is singing. Otherwise, the screen is black, with only the sound of his guitar.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114055,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZKM Karlsruhe","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Theory 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
