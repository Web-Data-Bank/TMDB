Then Hurricane Maria swept through, a bomb of wind, water and devastation. In the destruction left behind, Huffman and his friends employed their rigging skills to clear trees, retrieve belongings and help the island on its long path of recovery. And in the process, they discovered that Maria had uncovered new climbing zones. “Maria made us realize the duality of things,” he says. “Even when you think it’s the worst case scenario, there’s always something positive out of it.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":117960,"logo_path":null,"name":"Encompass Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Climbing out of Disaster","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
