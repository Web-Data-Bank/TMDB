However, three years later many are still unhappy with this system, and a group of nobles led by Lyros, Prince of Valcania, plan a coup d'etat.  Two days before the planned coup, Lyros asks Dianna Silvernale, the captain of the Royal Guard of Valcania, to join him in order to overthrow the confederation and reclaim the nation for the sake of Valcania's people. Now, Lady Silvernale has very little time to decide whether to follow her prince or to prevent another war that will likely break out.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/ohfe3fphe1ltiELruR3cHkuzwLj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17315,"logo_path":"/w8YlPWsdAhQsbIrX0w9H1HRD9rG.png","name":"feel.","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":19533,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZEXCS","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":50555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2005-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Growlanser IV: Wayfarer of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
