Born in Vienna, the capital of Austria in 1958, he participated in the development of Viennas subculture through his bar called \"Fun Factory\". It was a unique place to have some cheap drinks, see strange movies and join concerts in the cellar. He also influenced the Viennese film community by bringing art house and underground movies, like \"Liquid Sky\" (1982), or \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1973) in uncut versions to the theaters. As he was a film maniac he started to direct movies by himself. His first two movies \"I was a Teenage Zabbadoing\" (1988) and \"Mondo Weirdo - a Trip to Paranoia Paradise\"(1990) became underground classics. In the late 80's Andersen went to Berlin. There he directed and produced more than 10 No-Budget movies. Diffic ult relationships and the process of filmmaking itself were his main themes. He got lost in alcoholism and committed suicide in August 2012.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aOtTEoVOOYsr1z2rutsgwgQ41yD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2015-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carl Andersens Underground der Liebe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
