It can be considered as the cinematographic equivalent of Tristan Tzara's method on how to make a dadaist poem by putting words in a bag, and it mostly rises from Isidore Isou's film enthusiasm. The film has been made in fact out of elements of film strips found in the trashcan of a film development laboratory, that have been subsequently taped together bit by bit following the exact order they were originally gathered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9LbznE1AxHPjFKbVJ1JMYwtrAiH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1968-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une Oeuvre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
