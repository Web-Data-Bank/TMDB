He is practically alone in a genre (black and white silent abstractions) which has its antecedents in the likes of Eggeling, Richter and Leger.  What I find most interesting in his work, amid the concern with textures, shape and space, is his ability to produce works of even tension. Doing away with concepts of beginning, middle and end, he presents a broad landscape, piece by piece, until he has exhausted the source of his subject matter and the whole scene lies there naked and revealed.' - Carmen Vigil, Director, The Cinematheque, San Francisco Art Institute.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rTDqY1mgRmGwhfIwxSdQpzkiBOX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frozen Flight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
