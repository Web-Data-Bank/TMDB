Chanel is one of those people. Obsessing over her ex-husband, Chad, Chanel hires a private investigator to find out if he's cheating on his new wife Emma. But Chanel's obsession with her ex has created challenges in her own marriage to the kind and faithful, Damon - sending both of them into couple's therapy. Certain that her dissatisfaction is related to Damon being too nice and needing a little more drama in her life, Chanel gets her claws into her therapist, Jay. But the pursuit of satisfaction doesn't always have a happy ending and for Chanel, her bad deeds aren't without consequence.","popularity":2.193,"poster_path":"/liDZ0D9PGPfyiFGd9vATq7GUL4x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6671,"logo_path":"/6im4djIvfI8aLD1hVsZTQ2Fi4uL.png","name":"Sweet Sinner","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You can never have too many lovers.","title":"The Mistress 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
