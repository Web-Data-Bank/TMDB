This device allows forms to be deployed by the movement, but is still untapped by narrative film: contracting and leaking spaces, crushed signs, decomposition of movements by other movements, dripping and corpuscular choreography. Mobiles is the result of a continuous tension between abstraction and reality. The same goes for the relationship between sound and image, which echo one another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vuriKlrFFkEmYgohi23DggAiawg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mobiles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
