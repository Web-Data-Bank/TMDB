Along the way he encounters the faces of those who speak about wounds that cannot heal—survivors recounting the deaths and disappearances of their beloveds during Peru's civil war that pitted the communists of The Shining Path against the government, with both sides aligned against the people. \"The dead have called us to find them,\" remarks Lida Flores de Huaman, and Marcos follows her evocation, cutting memory trails into Peru that bring back the names of the disappeared. Using frames that are strong and tender, steady and compassionate, he summons a community of memorials that dare to remember.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/25WPdBhsObzoQxyR1wZKizqSWv9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for Carmen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
