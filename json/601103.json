The last images of a film which lets you no escape, no more escape than the punkette who exhibits her genitals in a toilet hallway, no more escape than all these rockstars who belch to fill the void. On the music aspect, there is a combinatorial saturation of sounds that looks like a requiem. The images : uninterrupted movement un a daily apocalyptic space. This is about savagery, frantic intoxication, suicidal energy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ePwyIehjYCOYb2dzZu1oHMJKEiK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entrée de secours","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
