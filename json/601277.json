One man is led away, and the group crosses the river. The neighbouring Grbavica district is about to be taken by the Serbs. The footage was shot by a man from an apartment in an adjacent skyscraper without knowing who the armed men were. Are they Serbs, Bosniaks? His camera wobbles, searches, pursues and retreats. The artist Clarissa Thieme finds the man who shot the film and has him once again recount how it happened.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Ik6WL1nBNyXVXCwcyexL6n1WFZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clarissa Thieme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Can’t You See Them? – Repeat.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
