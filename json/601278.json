Visual Music for Ten Voices distinguishes the physicality of the optical vocal track as having a unique identity from its actual resonance in sound films. Designed as a 10-foot black box projection loop, this film focuses on the rhythm and materiality of ten 35mm optical soundtracks. Each musical passage maintains its original length and linear harmony with the other tracks, collectively creating a new sense of motion and repetition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3XpKToePkLtpEN8IgILJGMiZ7GC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visual Music for 10 Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
