In the Men's Singles, the world number one Rafael Nadal returned to SW19 to defend his title, hot off the success of a sixth French Open victory and determined to prevail ahead of 2011's form player Novak Djokovic. In the Women's Singles defending champion Serena Williams was attempting to win her 14th Grand Slam crown, despite having played sparingly since winning the 2010 title due to injury and illness. Six-time champion Roger Federer, in search of a record equaling 7th triumph, crashed out at the quarter-final stage for the second year in succession, beaten by the twelfth seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zXlv1PYYTln1PgsMD0rEA8GI9gl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wimbledon 2011 Official Film","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
