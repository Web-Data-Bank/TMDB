A native of Dakar in Senegal he has been singing and performing since his childhood. He has performed with many leading western artists including Paul Simon, Neneh Cherry and Branford Marsalis but is perhaps best known for his association with Peter Gabriel. He was one of the stars of the 1988 Amnesty Tour and appeared at 8 Live concerts in Hyde Park, the Eden Project, Paris and Edinburgh - three of them on the same day! This concert from 1989 features Youssou N'Dour with his band Le Super Etoile de Dakar and was the first of four appearances he has made at the Montreux festival to date. N'Dour's voice is as fine as ever and the show is a showcase for the colour, emotion and energy so characteristic of his performances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qmtplKM0HEVgWjCgOrd77lZWNph.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214,"logo_path":"/qIptM4dZBNflgv2OXzYECv8iQNH.png","name":"Eagle Vision","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Youssou N'Dour: Live at Montreux 1989","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
