Since I was traveling, writing letters in unknown lands, I also had very limited access to technology. I write my video letters with Fisher Price Pixelvision, Super-8, and Hi-8. When I could not find editing facilities I edited them with the camera. They became records of my desires desperately in need of an outlet… When shown in public, they re-invent new meanings in different contexts. They become letters to anyone who can relate to them.” — Yau Ching","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A1890G6l80V6Byx8HL2gMfLSWMx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Letters 1-3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
