He returns to Peak Performances with the American premiere of “Democracy in America,” freely inspired by the work of Alexis de Tocqueville. Castellucci conjures majorettes who stir the crowd’s enthusiasm for democracy in America, colonial settlers who confound the native Americans, and a puritan couple who struggle to farm a barren land. He asks us to consider the empty promises of a political system steeped in Biblical egalitarianism rather than the concept of tragedy so essential to ancient Greek democracy, the dangers of majority rule, and the inherent violence that springs from religious puritanism and territorial conquests. His challenging, soul-stirring brand of theatrical magic transposes these painful, profound ideas into an enticing, vibrant, celebratory work of art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gmlIJuEahqXRA2Opny4pQcGiqHJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Socíetas Raffaello Sanzio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ojibwa","iso_639_1":"oj","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Democracy in America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
