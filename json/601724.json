Through the performance, Anger probes and dissects her “abandoned” works to re-imagine the relationship between the audience, the filmmaker, the movie theater and cinema and erases the line between a filmmaker’s corporeal body and their body of work. A vital, singular, innovative work that explores what it means to be a woman and an artist, the project showcases Anger’s sensibilities and pushes the boundaries of cinematic experience.","popularity":0.939,"poster_path":"/iFsYAMkKHDqmJX0RYkLOCdhPEdy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34777,"logo_path":"/oZA5oinnPpGTSMFt6mlhIBDLUL5.png","name":"Memory","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Live Cinema Presentation","title":"My First Film","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
