While most of these were utilitarian in nature, Bouanani, Tazi, and Rechiche took a different route with this film, creating a modernist “city symphony” film that documented six hours in the life of the city of Casablanca. Combining a hard bebop soundtrack with stunning black and white cinematography and a radical editing style, the film stands as a document to the energetic experimentation of this period of Moroccan art and cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/csC510QlhYuXXaMSt1v3tgxmvqd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36252,"logo_path":"/xHIIkI4AXFHrz8jiUzcQtd6dt6W.png","name":"Centre Cinématographique Marocain (CCM)","origin_country":"MA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"1968-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Six and Twelve","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
