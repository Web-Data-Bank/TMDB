A town without a name. A town not on the map. A town with its own rules. A town without access from the outside. A town with secrets not available even to those 'living' there. How long? Suddenly a time warp, an accident of fate and then unexpectedly the appearance of a woman from beyond. Then it begins. The hidden ways of the town start surfacing. Although no way out of the town, the arrival of Alice puts the town's ways to a test.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Aka0fcxEDRh8Fq0qEXRnKbDNd8m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2018-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City Where Money Does Not Circulate","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
