Lucy reveals how Victoria used music to transform the monarchy from a political power into a benevolent cultural force that brought the country together during a time of great upheaval and change. Lucy also examines the central role music played in Victoria’s own life - as a queen, a private person and in her marriage to Prince Albert.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/blJhgXEjLxc9d0W0yrrL9Fw4LCM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen Victoria: My Musical Britain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
