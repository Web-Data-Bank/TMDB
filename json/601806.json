Using the images recorded on a cruise ship made by his parents, the author invokes a dystopian society where the problems of collective coexistence are solved by an algorithm, and where the prohibition of abortion is compensated by a law that allows parents to prosecute their children if, at the age of 30, they have not fulfilled the expectations placed on them. In La Veda, the authorâ€™s voice-over derives on his fatherly figures, stripping them with brutal honesty under the gaze of an existential void shaped like a virus and with the only testimony of a video camera that is treated as if it were a newcomer to the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Veda","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
