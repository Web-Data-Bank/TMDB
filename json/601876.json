A self-made millionaire, Pellatt was derided by fellow aristocrats for nouveau-riche pretentions:  the house and its décor considered by many an ornate fake.  Its original contents were sold at Pellatt’s bankruptcy auction in 1924. Today the building is a museum. The movie has three sections—the first in a cellar tunnel, the next in a first-story workroom near the stables, the third in the tower’s summit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bVpe2qcN06wTUKobnwCrJx9JBKq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corpus Fluxus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Casa Loma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
