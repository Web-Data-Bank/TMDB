Totaling more than 20,000 feet of film (10 hours), Harry Chuck's exquisite unreleased footage has captured a divided community's struggles for self-determination. Chinatown Rising is a documentary film about the Asian-American Movement from the perspective of the young residents on the front lines of their historic neighborhood in transition. Through publicly challenging the conservative views of their elders, their demonstrations and protests of the 1960s-1980s rattled the once quiet streets during the communityâ€™s shift in power. Forty-five years later, in intimate interviews these activists recall their roles and experiences in response to the need for social change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3T6l1p541gNgIxTIEBMhEqxE86a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chuckwow Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":76564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Center for Asian American Media Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chinatown Rising","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
