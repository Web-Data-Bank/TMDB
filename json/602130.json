A hotel in Etelhem in the middle of Gotland, which has not been in use since the 30th century. Inside, among dust and dead flies, time has stood still. Now, the eroded environments are taken and brought to life by colourful characters. The abandoned village street fills with people and life. The railways put into use, the hotel welcomes new guests, the bar serves cold beer and the village motorcycle gang stops outside the entrance again. Just like it used to be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":118325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zirkus Loko-Motiv","origin_country":""},{"id":118326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Per Wickander Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2015-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel Esplanad","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
