As she travels, her daydreams take on the force of reality as she fantazises about the past with Regine, yet the change in color tonalities of her imaginings and other camera tricks contrast her make-believe world with the scenic countryside and picturesque villages she passes on her way. As the road unspools before her like a role of film, images from her mind's storehouse of reels flash by - and the parallels between traveling away and mentally going back become clearer, for as the title suggests, she has to \"depart to arrive.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rqjIPgnTbr3sHItfBMMOuUUcD7z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Depart to Arrive","video":false,"vote_average":0.8,"vote_count":2}
