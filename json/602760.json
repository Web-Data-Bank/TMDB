At Gabriela C치mara's acclaimed Contramar in Mexico City, the welcoming, uniformed waiters are as beloved by diners as the menu featuring fresh, local seafood caught within 24 hours. The entire staff sees themselves as part of an extended family. Meanwhile at Cala in San Francisco, C치mara hires staff from different backgrounds and cultures, including ex-felons and ex-addicts, who view the work as an important opportunity to grow as individuals. A Tale of Two Kitchens explores the ways in which a restaurant can serve as a place of both dignity and community.","popularity":2.339,"poster_path":"/aDWrndCc2bOVB8FU7OdJjNVZtYE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125863,"logo_path":"/bb2ktapd4HjS8bWMYMcTwJY30xo.png","name":"No Ficci칩n","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tale of Two Kitchens","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":17}
