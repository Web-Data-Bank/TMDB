He emigrated in the early 1980s, and has spent the last several decades living on his own in the Australian outback as a hermit and Buddhist. Documentary filmmaker Jiří Holba sought Soukup out on his large property in the bush, where he builds secret shelters and lives away from civilization. The film, which Holba shot entirely alone on location, presents spontaneous conversations and situations that fully capture Soukup’s distinctive charisma. The film’s series of monologues are a kind of stream of thoughts that are part mad rambling and part insightful observations on life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ylhJwdF1g2Dg0fNIn0ODUTCLt9Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wet Cat Pictures","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2018-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
