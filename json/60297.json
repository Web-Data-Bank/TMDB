His only hope is a transplant from his brother, Paul. But Pierre hates Paul and has refused to see him for the past ten years. They are different in every aspect : their way of life, their tastes. Nevertheless, Marie, Pierre's fiancee, is determined to reconcile the two men.

After a few too many drinks and a bit of fooling around, the settling of scores between the two brothers will come to a surprising end.","popularity":1.946,"poster_path":"/1wq9Umi5eWkP2eTIqsTQXrhM69P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Alain Sarde","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":168443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofica Studio Images 8","origin_country":""},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":67543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tentative d'Evasion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slice of Life","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":23}
