Through a wealth of interviews, film clips, and archival footage, Sono Gassman! reveals how Gassman’s comedic screen persona cannily reflected and critiqued mid-20th-century Italian society, while shedding light on the complex inner life of the man himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9rZcmQQb2aMk5M890BvD1bMdWwq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dean Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":34401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Surf Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":317,"logo_path":"/HJj0J9Tk6AGcLpL4O7mI3bsccM.png","name":"Istituto Luce Cinecittà","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sono Gassman! - Vittorio re della commedia","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":3}
