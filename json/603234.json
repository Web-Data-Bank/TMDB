But while that approach may sound pretty frightening to traditionalists, this can't in fairness be viewed as a typical yoga video; nor does Barrett, who commingles power yoga moves and what she describes as \"core-conditioning power pilates,\" make any claims that it is. Many of the poses--including Warrior II, extended right angle, cobra, locust, and others--will certainly be familiar to yogis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vUZKLC2Pq0FzadF2MRDNb6XAlm3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16839,"logo_path":"/wxIDEXG8COFTlY96jbgrIEgKQb3.png","name":"Anchor Bay Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crunch: Super SlimDown - Yoga/Pilates Blend","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
