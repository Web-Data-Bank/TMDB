If so, this 30-minute Latin aerobic workout will be your cup of salsa. Some of the moves are distinctly Latin, such as the mambo and cha cha. Others are ordinary aerobic moves, but given a Latin flair with distinctive rhythm or hip and arm moves. The instructor is excellent: she cues flawlessly, explains clearly, warns you about changes, and builds the moves into patterns gradually. The choreography is sometimes complex, but it is taught so well that if you're reasonably coordinated, you'll get it. The instructor is accompanied by a class of six young women who whoop enthusiastically through the whole workout, which you may find motivating or annoying.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9ReI1ibtiKUyfr9ymyzjtdkKNc9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16839,"logo_path":"/wxIDEXG8COFTlY96jbgrIEgKQb3.png","name":"Anchor Bay Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crunch: Fat Blaster Goes Latin","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
