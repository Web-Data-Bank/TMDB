And what a place! It was a 13th-century tower, part of the ancient city wall. The Cassero di Porta Saragozza was one of the most important milestones in the history of the Italian LGBT community. This was also a monumental step for the social evolution of Bologna. The film shows the main stages which led the city council to make this unusual decision and the activities of Cassero in its early years. These begin from the 80's, and we see the movement change from a revolutionary organisation fighting for rights for gays to an established institution playing a central role in the cultural life of Bologna. Rediscovered photos and videos, performances by drag queens and the history of the organisation told by its protagonists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nEE7GaYX8FlxQ0pM2Hw9ZWMEDKW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torri, checche e tortellini","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
