But who is Olesya?... a 16-year-old feeble-minded girl, the week-long wife, a blessed fool with superpowers, able to light up lamps and electrocute in the bedroom. She is a literary character living in 21st century Moscow, unaware of her own beauty and power. For the two young and rich playboys, Olesya's 'spicy make-up' takes on a whole new meaning.
