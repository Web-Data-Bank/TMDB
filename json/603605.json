The performances were held in temporary “non-places” of undetermined statuses. These areas became filled with unwanted music – unpleasant noise driven out of urban spaces. The premise behind the film project involved seeking new contexts for marginal sound; the consecutive segments-concerts made up a tale of man’s acting in a space, while the noise generated by the artists became a metaphor of man’s interference with the environment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reverberation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
