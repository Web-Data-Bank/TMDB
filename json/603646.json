Beautifully shot at Riverview Hospital (formerly an insane asylum), the film follows the journey of Scheherazade, a young model attempting to insulate herself from paternalistic and sinister medicalization throught the re-telling of tabloid tales. Replete with lesbians, anorexics, necrophillic undertones and a deluge of menstrual blood, Pietrobruno's febrile fable contains enough raw passion to ignite the sensiblities of even the most faded feminists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9OXXZnWjlNjHIT7op6Pwqlxk7Fv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cat Swallows Parakeet and Speaks!","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
