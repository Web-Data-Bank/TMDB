Drawing on her encounters with religion and psychology she poignantly recounts the spiritual reawakening she experienced while weathering the storms of an explosive love affair with a beautiful femmeâ€”an affair which precariously straddles the boundaries between obsession and passion, and yet is told with a disarming humour. Woven into this narrative are the insights of lesbian women talking butch-to-butch and femme-to-femme about yin/yang chemistry and a love that borders on worship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Femme Divine","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
