What is she looking for?  What will she encounter?  Rural life in the era of globa­li­sa­tion turns into an adven­ture.  History lives in objects, stories and customs here since it was first recorded 800 years ago.  Wars and famines have left their traces, just as churches, poli­tical parties and various forms of govern­ment.  The change of the times, struc­tured by tele­vi­sion, has almost obscu­rely changed the old rhythms of life; super­market offers changed eating habits and food stock economy.  Is it folk­lore nost­algia or a matter of preser­ving one’s way and quality of life to keep the old customs and habits, such as preser­ving old types of plants and boiling down cucum­bers?  The village -  a mutual exch­ange of expe­ri­ences and garden products.  The village is like an onion:  it shows ever new surpri­sing layers and leads us deep into unwritten pasts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Helke Sander Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
