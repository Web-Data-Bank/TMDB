The card magic that Derren performs and teaches offers a rare glimpse into how he thinks about his magic, and how he constructs routines. Then, as now, the audience's emotions are always Derren's primary focus.\r Over the course of three hours, The Devil's Picturebook gives the audience a detailed insight into this rare Derren Brown material. The first half explains in detail some classic card routines from his early career as a conjurer, all of which rely on sleight of hand, misdirection, and audience management. The second half features his incredible, pioneering psychological card routines and shows a distinct move towards the mentalism for which he is now known.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/maXkRZndrye6AOHicxiA7zViHJM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":166,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The professional card repertoire of Derren Brown","title":"Derren Brown: The Devil's Picturebook","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
