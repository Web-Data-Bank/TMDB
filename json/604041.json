The fire in the cities","overview":"Although it can be first thought that these images were generated using software and custom algorithms, it’s been actually filmed in 2010 in Berlin, using three camera movements: agitation, circumvolution and tilt [adding sideway movements to the vertical ones].  Fire has brought human beings together since ancient times. In my childhood winters, fire was the center around which all my village neighbours met. There, many stories were told; secrets, tales and legends. Outside time itself, as I sat there listening, I was fascinated by those irregular shapes forming in the fire tongues, as they rose and crackled; or perhaps I’d play with a red-hot penny among the embers, which -when properly shaken- would produce incredible light strokes in the darkness. These would persist only for a brief moment in the air, but leave a far less ephemeral emotional trace within me.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neon.
