Since 2015, director Karin de Miguel Wessendorf has accompanied the protests against the clearing of the Hambacher forest and against the destruction of the villages on the edge of the lignite opencast mining, the largest CO2 source in Europe. First it was only a rebellion of individual groups with different goals, but in the autumn of 2018 the protest against the clearing finally becomes one broad supraregional movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ecVlQvcA3ggTbTK6F9lo8WcbDEL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Line - Resistance in Hambach Forest","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
