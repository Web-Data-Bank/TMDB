Or are they – as WG Sebald describes – alien structures denuded from human history?  The first collaboration between filmmaker Luke Fowler and acclaimed sound recordist Chris Watson. Enceindre is a study in film and sound of two 16th century fortified cities: Berwick in the North-East of England and Pamplona in the Navarre region of the North of Spain.  The film considers the wider psychological and social resonances of what it means to live within a town defined by its historical complex of defensive walls and bastions. By adopting an “infra-sensitive” approach to place; Enceindre draws on overlooked acoustic perspectives and lucid camerawork to propose a new framework in which to consider these anachronistic structures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xe3UKEQpPpHXGebscMwmU48E94s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enceindre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
