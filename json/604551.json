The young women interviewed speak openly about their experiences of coming out to friends and parents and how in many cases they were told it was only a ‘phase’ they would grow out of. ‘If you can go out with boys at 14 and that’s OK, why can’t you go out with someone of your own sex without it being a crush’ asks one of the young women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vwXfE1kR04ExzBpvKXbZP2QcGdp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Veronica Four Rose","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
