Complete exposure of reclining bodies and their lascivious perambulations. Licentious characters in incestuous copulations of carnal metamorphoses and abnormal couplings. The transformations of their bodies in totemic visualizations of a uniquely local rite. Made up of fantastical phallic doublings and entanglements of purely fantastic flesh in dissolution. The entropy of a gymnastic grotesque. A film of smiles and happiness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e64I2cVq5IzG4FUBuCHdofETWgM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Film Gets Hot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
