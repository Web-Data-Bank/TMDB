It is a wild mosaic of startling imagery including a safe-sex foot fucking scene with toes in a condom, a woman flasher, and a woman voyeur in a wheelchair who comments on the street life near a public toilet. Desert of Love is a challenging, highly original work from one of Germany’s most exciting gay talents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desert of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
