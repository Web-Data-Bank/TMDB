Concerns about AIDS, child molestation, sex education and the effect of the absence of a ‘’traditional’’ family setting on foster children are sensitively addressed. A careful look at what life is really like in lesbian and gay families, We Are Family is ultimately about the well-being of children. It concludes that homosexuals are as capable as heterosexuals of being committed, loving parents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Family: Parenting and Foster Parenting in Gay Families","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
