The star is 25-year-old Yoshiichi Yano who has written a play he hopes will open the public’s eyes to the status of gays in contemporary Japan, a society with deep-rooted prejudices against homosexuality. With abundant humor and nonchalant candor, director Yasufumi Kojima follows the day-to-day efforts of Yano to produce his play while introducing us to Yano’s friends and actors in the play, including a stunning drag queen and a charming 60-year-old man who claims to be gay but a virgin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kKPBGrJ3xfKACwXYFHbbl1mlihk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rough Sketch of a Spiral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
