In 1900 he launched his 'phono bio tableaux', which synchronised songs recorded by famous music stars on disc with a film of the performance. Sadly, all but one of the films are lost, making this last survivor a unique record of a major Victorian music hall star in sound and vision, as well as the oldest British 'sound film' - nearly 30 years before the 'talkies' arrived here.  Lil Hawthorne, who performs this song, was a well-known American singer, often adopting a male persona, although she was not strictly a male impersonator. It was her concerns about the disappearance of a friend that alerted the police to the crime of the notorious murderer Dr Crippen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/noOgb3RTvkXWyhtAq8QXuVHJ27c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1900-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kitty Mahone","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
