They are as follows: 1 - daytime, facing east, with animation, desert from a window; 2 - daytime, facing south, with same animation, desert from a window; 3 - daytime, facing west, doghouse from a window; 4 - night, in front of a fireplace on the north wall; animation. The early pleasures are in the texture of the paper on the desert in the 1st two sections, side-lit (like a sea or dimpled skin), and the sun's first ray on the curled corner; the thrill of the comparison of places. Then maybe, the thrill that they actually exist in the same time and place, and are not contrived in an optical printer; then to learn that the fades in and out of the animation are by changes in the natural light. There are two animations: - the hairs or worms or cracks, waving like underwater plans (1000 drawings) and a title, 'Log Hill', handwritten in different ways (100 drawings). -- Amy Halpern","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Corners","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
