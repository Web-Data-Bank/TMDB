From there we head inland to Totnes, over the infamous banks at Dainton and Rattery, through Ivybridge on the very edge of Dartmoor and into Plymouth itself. We finish with a driver’s eye view of the Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash.  Filmed in 1986 just weeks before the semaphore signals were abolished for ever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ePiekzV3oXNzeTmAgvvMPhphEKb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video 125","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exeter to Plymouth","title":"HST West - Driver's Eye View","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
