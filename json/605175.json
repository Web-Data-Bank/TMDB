Will the computer replace the automobile?\" These questions are taken up by six prominent writers, musicians, and multi-media workers, who describe their own shifting relationships to technology and public space within the city. Awakening from the 20th Century is structured around imagery from several San Francisco sites: the broadcast transmission tower Sutro Tower; \"Critical Mass,\" an activist bicycle event; and locations from the Dashiel Hammet Walking Tour, which are interspersed with scenes from The Maltese Falcon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7G4dPyPFAbTigjFNGagnWQU5fX6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Arts Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Awakening from the 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
