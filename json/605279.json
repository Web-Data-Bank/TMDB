He’s not too bothered about being unemployed, but the same cannot be said of his wife Bahar. Onur doesn’t listen to her and becomes indifferent not only to her anxieties but also to the world around him. He’d rather be surrounded by more zebras. A drama with dashes of absurd comedy about events that are no laughing matter: a personal crisis that impacts their marriage.","popularity":1.222,"poster_path":"/imiDwyZwo1Z1SBOa3TRvvChNaLt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asteros Film","origin_country":""},{"id":101427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Karaçelik Film","origin_country":"TR"},{"id":1935,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zebra Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2019-07-01","revenue":37234,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Belle Indifference","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
