Although his novelistic work is strongly auto-biographical, he always engaged in Swiss politics. In this movie, he says: \"Although I am writer, my existence is that of a human, a contemporary, a witness, a believer, a doubter, a desperate, an accepter, a refuser, one who loves and wants to be loved, a hater, a creative, an ambitious, a good and a bad mensch\". Filmmakers Walter Marti and Reni Mertens offered Diggelmann one hour of time in order to explain and to defend himself, to accuse, to apologize, to reconsider his judgments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qmXFQPNudnPpUewHQG0e7CnDdE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Selbstzerstörung des Walter Matthias Diggelmann","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
