To explore this we've chosen a place where barriers are visible and insurmountable, a place where love becomes impossible: in jail. The separation, loneliness and institutionalization of prison life intensifies the waiting, the fears, the hopes, insecurity and neediness, emotional blackmail and dependency. A long tunnel of barriers progressively narrows and eventually blocks out the horizon for a love relationship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qAVlQVJUS2paHlJCq2UHlSxzoG1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'ora d'amore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
