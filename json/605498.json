The Greek state has ceded its mining rights over 31.700 ha of land in northern Halkidiki, a region rich in gold, copper and other metals, to the Canadian multinational company Eldorado Gold. However, many of the region’s inhabitants, who have been resisting the construction of a goldmine for years, claim that this investment will cause irreparable damage to the environment and the benefits will be fewer than the losses.  “Cassandra’s Treasure” presents a detailed picture of the modern Greek state before and during the crisis period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/scgT9SZGXrTw5H1AtfJahOxV4oU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Small planet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2012-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden Times – Cassandra’s Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
