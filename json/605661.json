Malham is in the Yorkshire Dales, and is a place of dramatic natural beauty that is defined, for me at least, by the waters that run through it; those same waters that formed it slowly but surely over thousands upon thousands of years. ‘Foss’ is Yorkshire-speak (from Old Norse) for ‘Falls’. There’s even one waterfall there that has bored a hole right through the very centre of a huge rock. My film is a personal response to this place, a simple Super 8 work edited entirely in camera. I offer it up to the goddesses and gods of the Yorkshire Dales. Yes, I suppose I do worship at their feet, because Malham is the kind of church I go to.\" — M.J.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foss","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
