Synaesthesia is an experience of cross-modal sensuality – of ‘seeing green’ or ‘tasting pink’, hearing colours or feeling smells as shapes. I think everyone is latently synaesthetic, and that certain ways of making cinema might be able to trigger the experience. Peach combines artisanal Super 8 filmmaking with complex emotions in an attempt to create ‘Cinesthetic Synaema’. The film’s title comes from a combination of things – the peachy colour of the film which is caused by the way it was made, Jojo’s different experiences of peach as a colour, and an affectionate name my mum gave me as a kid.\" — M.J.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peach","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
