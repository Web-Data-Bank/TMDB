I was making loads of photographic and film work, and experimenting with organic processing techniques. There were 9 of us who were in residence at Arteles. When I was due to leave, I actually missed my flight – the first time in a lifetime of flights – and when I arrived back at Arteles that afternoon (much to everyone’s surprise!), this film is what happened… I see it as a sketch of life at Arteles, a line drawing with silver of a chance happening that I would have missed had I got on that flight.\" — M.J.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaved Head, Missed Flight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
