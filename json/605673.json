It was a sunny afternoon, and there weren’t many people in the park at all. My desire consumed me, and I had a strong impulse to retreat to the overgrowth and phone my lover, and to pleasure myself until I came.

The result is this film.\" — M.J.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Ramble in Serralves Park","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
