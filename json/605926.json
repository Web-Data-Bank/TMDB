From some critics comes cautious concern, from others, complete attack. At the centre of it all is the past of this extreme athlete, the first 20-odd years of life that Michelle spent as Michael. In 2002, Dumaresq became the first openly transgendered woman in the world to be named to a national team in any sport. Beginning with her days on the BC race circuit, to the Canada Cup, the national title and a berth at the World Championships, her progress is dogged by constant scrutiny, both from fellow competitors and the media. Dumaresq insists she doesn't race to make a stand, but doesn't shy from being a trailblazer. She grew up in turmoil over her identity and struggled to come to terms with herself as an adult, even with her parents' whole-hearted support. She takes on the mantle of role model because she understands how isolated others like her feel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/toUYLQJp53SIsrG1ZeGB8jdFEuU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"100% Woman","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
