Halleck says at the beginning that the images of Latin America she saw in Hollywood films didn't match the reality she knew growing up in Cuba. She then uses footage of old Hollywood films, newsreels and corporate advertising films to show that, even in the early 20th century, these problematic relations between Latin America and the US were well known to Americans, even if they didn't want to recognize them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vghSMZ9HhomuhFk1VzrDWsAe19l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119111,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeeDee Halleck Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gringo in Mananaland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
