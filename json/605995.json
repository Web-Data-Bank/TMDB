Dry leaves, wooden floors and a young man smoking a cigarette. Windows and doors are preparing the framing. The wind is coming up. Will it rain today? A young woman is pressing her face to a TV screen, all in blue but it is not water refreshing her. In her eyes, you see some hidden memories and dirty tennis balls lying on the street sucking up the drops of the rain. The short version is 12min, the original full version is 80min.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1g59iyannrRCTP13VnbsT2KPb1H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Groundwater","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
