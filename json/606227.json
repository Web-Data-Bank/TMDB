Mariagrazia suffers for the confrontation with her mother (Valeria Solarino), a former sports champion. Chiara has a chat with a peer, but she is too afraid to send him her photo. Letizia has a talent for music but too much shame to show it. After the umpteenth teasing, an unexpected opportunity for redemption comes from the popular and beautiful Alice, captain of the synchronized swimming school team, forced by a blackmail to train them in secret. The three girls embark on an impossible challenge, driven into the water by their desire for revenge.","popularity":2.307,"poster_path":"/bRamjKrwUKqRPbHqyxfg0YBToO9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18156,"logo_path":"/3nAuYcaWdpW0ULMvMz6V5HIJmCO.png","name":"Indiana Production","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":119152,"logo_path":null,"name":"La piccola società","origin_country":""},{"id":115535,"logo_path":"/mYoc1K3UPAUqKfuCYkvDLJN2aAA.png","name":"Vision Distribution","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":26261,"logo_path":"/thn5VXJ5JegdrtiJn7mFuV2NWB6.png","name":"Film Commission Torino Piemonte","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":77822,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Città di Torino","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-08-01","revenue":180000,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dolcissime","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":41}
