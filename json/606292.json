Each year in the US, 1.3 million abortions occur, but the topic is still so stigmatized it's never discussed in polite company.  Powerful, poignant, and fiercely honest, I HAD AN ABORTION tackles this taboo, featuring 10 women - including famed feminist Gloria Steinem - who candidly describe experiences spanning seven decades, from the years before Roe v. Wade to the present day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ikC5VvEg2YDRueNEnXwQSghYO4U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Speak Out","title":"I Had an Abortion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
