Due to its dramatic ending, the match has been regarded as one of the greatest grand finals in rugby league history, drawing comparisons with the 1989 NSWRL Grand Final and the 1997 ARL Grand Final.[2] Cowboys co-captain Johnathan Thurston, who kicked the winning field goal for his team, was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as the best player on the ground. Pre-match entertainment was headlined by Australian rock band Cold Chisel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ggMtfRkkvOsrLk7DQ9urbgCAq6E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2015 NRL Grand Final Brisbane Broncos vs North Queensland Cowboys","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
