The destinies of the film’s heroines, despite their ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious differences, largely coincide and create a contradictory portrait of a modern woman in the Islamic world.  Each of the heroines of the film is in conflict with the outside world, wants to change everything or return it as it was before.
