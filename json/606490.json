A thought-provoking piece on media's construction of societal paranoia \"Cruel Rhythm\" is an attempt to make a public, shared feeling intimate, or conversely, to make a subjective feeling of floating anxiety and dread into a shared representation.\" Unsettlingly, its ambiance is as poignant today as ever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2NDi5dzc7IaBxpcNGfVPXJ4YUhe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cruel Rhythm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
