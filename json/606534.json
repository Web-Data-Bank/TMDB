Unstable and by far the most volatile province in the country, it’s a unique opportunity to visit an area that’s normally out of bounds to tourists.  Located in the far northwest of the People’s Republic, on the borders of central Asia, Xinjiang is the scene of frequent clashes between the Chinese authorities and the Uyghurs, Turkish-speaking Muslims who, like their Tibetan neighbors, reject the colonization of their territory. Going beyond the Uyghur problem (which gets less media coverage than the unrest in neighboring Tibet) the aim of this documentary is to decipher the propaganda that is currently being put out by the Chinese, who are trying to convince the world, and Chinese tour operators in particular, that the region is a haven of peace, a heaven on earth suitable for mass tourism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7hr4vbgg0jJk8bw6ra5lJX2LfNi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"China's problems with the Uyghurs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
