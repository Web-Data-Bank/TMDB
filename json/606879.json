The four boys call themselves \"Bulk Rubbish\" and they drum out their resentment, having grown up on the new housing estates of East Berlin.  A straight-up picture of the GDR youth is presented here, which in no way conforms to the official image. The film crew concentrates on the observation of the boy Enrico and his mother Erika: when the mother marries in the West, her son decides to stay in East Berlin, bidding her farewell at the border-crossing. Only shortly after, the tables are turned again: as the events in Berlin leading up to the fall of the Wall are practically captured live from the film crew, Enrico insists on maintaining his cultural identity, even after the fall of the Wall. The \"Bulk Rubbish\" musicians want to remain citizens of their own state and perceive the looming reunification with scepticism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/upWpB2WYWgIoXbbNLfn8dwNOgnS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA Studio für Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1991-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bulky Trash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
