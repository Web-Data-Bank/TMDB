His figure became shrouded in mystery when she discovered that he was gay and the murder ‘’gay-related’’. Confronting her own grief in the deeply personal Theme: Murder, Swtzoff uncovers scores of journals and letters, and contacts former friends of her father to assemble a portrait of a man curiously obsessed with death, who may have led a rich, gay life in ‘50s and ‘60s Boston – a man who had not only secrets, but an entirely separate life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ipEEnCaZWABgLCLMqW6Vwds7yUe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theme: Murder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
