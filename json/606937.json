This documentary looks at some of the root causes behind the atrocities, and how existing matriarchal societies, whose cultural framework and belief systems not only embrace the feminine but see god as female, provide a much-needed peaceful and gender-balanced alternative to the violent, discriminatory cultures that currently dominate most of the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hV4QYtL8RJ2ff9LgJ5d5jKTWwAa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women Building Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
