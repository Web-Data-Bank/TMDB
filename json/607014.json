Produced by Jack Good, guests on the show included Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Little Richard, the Clara Ward Singers, the Buddy Miles Express, Paul Arnold and the Moon Express, and We Three.  Although they were billed as musical guests, Julie Driscoll and Brian Auger (alongside their then-backing band The Trinity) found themselves playing a prominent role; in fact, it can be argued that the special focused more on the guest stars (specifically, Auger and Driscoll) than the Monkees themselves. This special is notable as the Monkees' final performance as a quartet until 1986, as Peter Tork left the group at the end of the special's production.  The title is a play on \"​33 1⁄3 revolutions per minute.\"","popularity":0.901,"poster_path":"/n6HLN15wGmT1Ezkjf9gjcAzhXWm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screen Gems Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tonight's special traces The Monkees from their \"creation\" by a way-out sorcerer to their current eminence.","title":"33 ⅓ Revolutions per Monkee","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
