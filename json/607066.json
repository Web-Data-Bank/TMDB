A woman with long red hair (G.B. Jones) sits on a window sill and looks down with her binoculars at the street below. Meanwhile, Mary Tyler Moore escapes from an aggressive man and runs to the park. Boy/Girl is a documentation of a period of time when filmmaker LaBruce lived in a crummy, squat-like building at Queen and Parliament Streets in Toronto with the all-girl punk band, Fifth Column.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aR7sqsBjLhTSfe6Xx5cbLpiG6vr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boy / Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
