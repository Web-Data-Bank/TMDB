Life goes on without major mishaps in a large house surrounded by a beautiful garden. It is a wonderful world, a great bubble of comfort, where different personal spheres coexist: the mother, along with her three children and the Aymara inhabitants of the house. The drama surfaces slowly, without narrative ploys, observing day-to-day activities until internal and external forces make the bubble burst. The film relates the story of the final days of an upper-class family, at a time when the country is undergoing social changes.","popularity":2.026,"poster_path":"/qvevCZ91MXM5yQQlmeP5j4kRx9a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76546,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinenómada","origin_country":"BO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"2009-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Aymara","iso_639_1":"ay","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zona Sur","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":15}
