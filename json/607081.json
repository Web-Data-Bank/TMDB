Married to his high-school sweetheart, Wona, a heterosexual woman, for 12 years, no one would guess Rene was biologically a woman. Living under a veil of secrecy and lies, Rene and Wona's lives seemed fine until someone \"outted\" the couple at their beloved church and everything they knew was destroyed. The public revelation of Rene's secret starts to unravel his marriage to Wona. Through all of it, Rene continues to hold on to his lifelong obsession to become a biological male and goes on a cross-country search to find the best transgender surgeon, only to discover that the current surgery options are flawed. At the last minute, Rene finds a surgeon who has created an experimental procedure, which will be seen in THE OPPOSITE SEX for the first time.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/95fQccC4aJRWbt3VsuakCN3u6Gi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Opposite Sex: Rene's Story","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
