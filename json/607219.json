The film argues that the act of purchasing is the strongest aphrodisiac in a capitalist society, leaving open the possibility that a solution to toppling capitalism is to shift our sexual desires from consumerism to personal freedom from the state.\r The film was created during a residency at Signal Culture using a modified Paik-Abe Raster Manipulation Unit. A running VHS tape was manipulated using a voltage-controlled eurorack modular synthesizer, allowing the object of desire to be distorted, picked apart, and reveal its true form of capitalist allure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ldKM4KpiE00IJ8OdyD8o7gOtjGU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Burning Desire in a Dollar Bill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
