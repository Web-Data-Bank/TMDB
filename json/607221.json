It is seen under various light effects which create different colour and texture impressions. The timelessness of the monolith is suggested by negative colour, the result of using fine-grain Eastmancolour print stock in the camera, a slow speed material which required the intense Central Australian light for adequate exposure. A half-speed recording of the local bird call and insects contributes to the sense of cross eras. Human perception of time, colour and sound is questioned. As Einstein said: 'The distinction between past, present and future is only an illusion, even if a stubborn one.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/13ZlJqeu8nO6mO0AQbYNse02VTj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1978-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Uluru","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
