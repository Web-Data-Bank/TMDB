Legends say they are man-eaters, that even crocodiles fear them. Locals call them \"demon fish\" but angling legend Andy Coetzee calls them something else: an obsession. He dives into the predator-infested Okavango Delta and the treacherous Congo River on a mission to finally land what is considered to be the hardest fish in the world to catch.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/4J0fMrWkYmF6A9NLz3uI4NtfdH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Earth Touch","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Africa's Piranha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
