The opening of the restored building is celebrated in performances and installations by its new occupants. In common with Raban’s films that reflect upon different aspects of the changing face of London’s East End, this tightly structured film-poem confronts the present with the past: the building’s war-time role is recalled in archival images, and by women who served in it as Auxiliary Fire Service officers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uiYXF5bAVK62rOaRdxDAv98dXnZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Firestation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
