How can chapels turn into places of introspection? How can walls grant boundless freedom?  Driven by intense childhood impressions, director Christoph Schaub visits extraordinary churches, both ancient and futuristic, and discovers works of art that take him up to the skies and all the way down to the bottom of the ocean. With the help of architects Peter Zumthor, Peter Märkli, and Álvaro Siza Vieira, artists James Turrell and Cristina Iglesias, and drummer Sergé “Jojo” Mayer, he tries to make sense of the world and decipher our spiritual experiences using the seemingly abstract concepts of light, time, rhythm, sound, and shape. The superb cinematography turns this contemplative search into a multi-sensory experience.","popularity":1.001,"poster_path":"/dwrlU6H5VteyuSomwF6RqwPipZ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maximage","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":131167,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAGNETFILM GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Architecture of Infinity","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
