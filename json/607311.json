Their films, shows, songs and books influenced an entire nation and were the glue that held people's home together. As a comedic duo, they united right-wing ghosts and anarchists in laughter. When Tage dies prematurely, his children lose a father, Hasse a father figure and all of Sweden a country father. And when Palme dies just months after Tage, the Swedish stable society begins to crumble. For the first time, the Alfredson and Danielsson families open up the archives and give us exclusive access to their stories, photographs and recordings.","popularity":1.019,"poster_path":"/dF2ds2MvsEPFxa73LRPbW7KBY3r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39407,"logo_path":"/1ht2ayBUdGgKuLRCkTjyGVEY5VL.png","name":"B-Reel Films","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2019-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hasse & Tage - En kärlekshistoria","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":9}
