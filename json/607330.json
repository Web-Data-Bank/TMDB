The roles they were relegated to in Germany---peddler and petty merchant---were highly valued in the Gold Rush. Therefore, because of the openness of Gold Rush California, these Jews were far more assimilated into and had a greater impact on the building and defining of a major city than any other Jewish community in America. But this acceptance came as a price, as assimilation put this community in danger of losing its Jewish identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z3E3xAG7MxMivv2BzY7sJNLxYj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Jerusalem Jews and the Making of San Francisco","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
