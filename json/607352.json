With exclusive access to the European parliamentâ€™s Brexit Steering Group, this revelatory fly on the wall documentary captures the internal workings of European negotiators as they deal with an increasingly beleaguered Britain. As Europe contends with a decidedly un-United Kingdom, the austere corridors and dim-lit offices of Brussels become the stage for a human drama of epic proportions; a fractured tale that is by turns exasperating, tragic and hilarious.","popularity":0.608,"poster_path":"/t62bg6OI1gkVTH5ctuoZYA0sXO9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Journeyman Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brexit: Behind Closed Doors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
