Fritz Bauer, a previously unknown prosecutor, is on a mission. Against the policy of silence and denial, Bauer wants not only to examine these Nazis but to make the whole of Germany face up to its past. It would be a shock to the nation and a young generation of Germans would be horrified to discover the crimes of their parents. German society would never be the same.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mKViUIjsyBas7H4swqaZ1f65H45.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":55216,"logo_path":"/pyDDOSzQdVQU5F69qBOgtCn8q9J.png","name":"Kuiv Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fritz Bauer, un procureur contre le nazisme","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
