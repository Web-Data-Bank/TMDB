Our princess*, if you will, is a pink anus that takes on a journey to the often mystical place of the cruising area. Where colourful hands try to seduce our protagonist and communication is set to a meaningless and shallow minimum. Cruising usually happens far away from our heteronormative society but at the same time in public spaces. In poof paradise those spaces transform into a surreal world where the possibilities of queer identities are endless and the existing boundaries of our societal norms dissolve. Influenced by James Bidgood and John Waters, the artists create a lustful amalgam of the sweet and the bizarre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poof Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
