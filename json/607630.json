There is a plague upon the sheep, and the vagabond pauses in his wanderings to cure the sheep - and win the love of Toinon. But the road calls him, and he goes, leaving the girl broken hearted. Francois marries her, and the child, Toinet, grows to be a lusty lad who loves the daughter of Pierre. Pierre, knowing the secret of his birth, refuses his consent, but again comes the vagabond, and once more his strange spells work for happiness, but he turns his back upon his new found son and the happiness he has wrought. The call of the open road is too strong.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jkgNbK3NfTU5V7JezYmUdQdFVkT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1917-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Vagabond of France","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
