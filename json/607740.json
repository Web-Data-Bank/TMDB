Jimmy Joe Roche directs “Skin of Man,” an experimental horror film that creates vivid textures with avant-garde technique. The black and white film is free of dialogue but overflowing with raw atmosphere, a psychedelic film about lost innocence and demonic forces. Once the drugs hit, all bets are off, and what began as a quiet walk through the woods becomes a terrifying descent into the unknown. -KA.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3KDbbiPgvV1GxaBYpJG8x1QKjE5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skin of Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
