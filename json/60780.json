They go on holiday to the Cederberg for a family reunion, which leads to plenty of surprises and reconciliation.  Hanna is an intelligent and imaginative young girl who's earned herself the nickname \"Hoekom,\" because she's forever questioning things. When her eccentric mother decides that the family – including her gay biological dad, actor stepfather, detestable half-brother and two stepbrothers – should spend their winter holiday in a remote house on a mountain, they end up stranded with nowhere to go and no-one to turn to except each other.","popularity":1.081,"poster_path":"/eNjXZA2YpWPAvvRdIhEaIuV6SM6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on the novel by Marita van der Vyver, this is an endearing coming-of-age dramatic comedy.","title":"Die Ongelooflike Avonture van Hanna Hoekom","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":4}
