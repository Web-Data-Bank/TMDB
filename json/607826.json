Ilmārs Blumbergs (1943-2016) is a concept in life than can be classically proven if we analyze his work in set design, poster art, painting and multimedia work. The personality of Blumbergs, however is a shifting and intangible material which ensures superior value, wonderfulness and intimacy to all that he created. Those who analyze his art and world perceptions, recognize the work as seeming to come from antiquity, but it can never be catalogued or recorded in bookkeeping. How fortunate that it also cannot be consumed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3j4towlaYOph8MNFSBaqrJ9S0BU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibīrijas bērni","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ilmārs Blumbergs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
