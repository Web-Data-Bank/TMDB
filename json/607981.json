Tony, a stern task master... Cora, his equally taciturn wife... their eldest daughter Bitty who cheats on her psychologist husband... and their adopted son, Jim, a cross-dressing, live-at-home sex addict. And then there's youngest daughter Gloria, the only hope of giving Tony and Cora a \"normal\" family. Gloria is set to marry wealthy blue-blood Bradley. Too bad she hates him and wonders if she's gay - a wonder which will come to light, be exploited, perverted and trashed by the time the long \"Homecoming\" weekend is over... proving once again that you can run, but you can't hide... from yourself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aTPi7t6Mc8CQmkkGNYL7xa3qb3w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":149,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Family?
