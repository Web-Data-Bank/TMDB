This sacrifice and his divorce have made him cynical about human nature and this manifests itself in his relationship with Abdulrahman, his aloof 12-year-old boy. Father and son do not see eye-to-eye, and it is as though they speak in different languages. Ahmed is also rather suspicious that his free-spirited sister is back from her travels in Europe to ensure she gets a nice chunk of the inheritance. Suddenly, Ahmed’s ex-wife sues to deny him visitation rights, claiming she doesn’t want her son to see his grandfather dying slowly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yxnyPdqEQgfjDosZRcuzf1MJQW8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"release_date":"2018-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Musk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
