First installed within the territory of the Krenak ethnic group, and later transferred to Carmésia, it imprisoned and tortured not only Krenak indigenous people, but several other ethnic groups such as the Pataxó, imposing restrictions on their ancestral practices under relentless surveillance by the military. The documentary shows how this concentration camp worked, and the consequences of this collective trauma for the affected indigenous peoples.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f7vhStgvLkxcUbz8gtOoEIoxc5W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138758,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viêtnam","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resplendor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
