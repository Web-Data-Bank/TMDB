With a sordid history of sexual and physical abuse, and having been caught in the arms of her female lover by her wealthy, overbearing mother, Val is forced to make a choice: to live a 'normal' life, or be forever cut off - financially and emotionally. She concedes to her mother's ultimatum, and pursues a heterosexual relationship to appease her, only to catch her new boyfriend in bed with another man. Her inability to cope with her life triggers her repressed male alter-ego to emerge and take over.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/buxSmYhd5hb5nOgCgAYy15cnF9k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Val/Val","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
