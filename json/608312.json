How did two busloads of lesbians headed to an underground nightclub help spark the birth of a lala (LBT) movement in China? At the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the first ever lesbian tent at an UN NGO Forum was created. Emerging from hidden shadows of shame and invisibility, Chinese lalas began a hard-fought path of deliverance from themselves, from family, and from an apprehensive environment. In doing so, they sought empowerment and change as they explored concepts and issues from self-affirmation to rights consciousness. The film powerfully moves forward to the present day and shows the drastic change in today’s young feminist lalas – their challenging of sexism and homophobia with daring public street actions on subways – a parallel action to their forerunners in 1995, with much vigor and defiance 20 years later.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nNAWshOtPvap0VSg5sr5yTbpHwE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
