These words and images were printed directly onto 35mm clear film stock at eminent letterpress studios in North America: the Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum in Two Rivers, the Center for Book and Paper Arts in Chicago, the Hatch Show Print in Nashville and the Musée de l’imprimerie du Québec & Lovell Litho in Montréal. Judith Poirier printed 1,643 feet of film to produce her abstract western and her technique of printing onto celluloid creates a unique texture on screen, as well as generating an original soundtrack. Setting West reinterprets a classic cinematic genre while exploring a formative period in the history of typography and printing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jadGztpIgLGGDBiaLXkwDdKLctc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Setting West","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
