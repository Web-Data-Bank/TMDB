But how did the composer come to develop his unique style? On this video, maestro Francois-Xavier Roth and the London Symphony Orchestra present the UK premiere of a previously lost work by the young Debussy, alongside some of his earliest inspirations. Debussy's newly discovered Premi√©re Suite gives a rare insight into the mind of a young composer on the cusp of innovation. It's a work filled with Romantic and Eastern influences and glimpses of the unexpected harmonies that came to define Debussy's work. Paired alongside the composer's role models - from Wagner's powerful intertwining motifs, the abundant Spanish influences in Lalo's rarely-heard Cello Concerto performed here by Edgar Moreau, and Massenet's majestic Le Cid - Francois-Xavier Roth gives a fresh perspective on the much-loved composer.","popularity":1.237,"poster_path":"/oQBwjapS8Gmb1LOFNiBYVaVrRHl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126347,"logo_path":null,"name":"LSO Live","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Symphony Orchestra: The Young Debussy","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
