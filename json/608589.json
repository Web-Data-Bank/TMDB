Each story, reconstructed by the artist from 3D animation sequences culled from news sources online, plays on two monitors, with each pair at a 90-degree angle. The artist exposes the fine line between official history and myth making in one of the biggest news stories of the post 9-11 era, which triggered reactions and conspiracy theories worldwide. The work also contemplates the ways storytelling and video editing can serve as means to steer away from or approximate to the truth.\" - Microscope Gallery","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/xAqahCkJJTS7dVWDvuk7O9T4MnH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Re: The Operation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
