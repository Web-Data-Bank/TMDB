Warhol experiments with an early videotape machine, recording a beautiful, laughing Edie Sedgwick - his \"superstar\" of the moment - for the video portion of \"Outer and Inner Space,\" his filmed record of the \"live\" Sedgwick juxtaposed against her video image on an adjacent monitor. Also captured is a Warhol show at the Leo Castelli gallery, including the famous Mylar \"Clouds,\" as various unnamed art dealers and critics muse in voiceover about the meaning and significance of Warhol's work.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/JP0tCP9ugvarbMDMZnp9BoQIIh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Superartist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
