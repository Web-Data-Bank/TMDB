Set in the crowded back alleys of Dhaka, Bangladesh, the film follows Salma as she enters the mysterious and rich world of transsexuality. Salma, a 15-year old Hijra, left her village and family to enter the effervescent city life in search of a clear identity, love and above all, a sense of acceptance. Emotionally torn between her youth and her desire of being a woman, Salma will be faced with events that will force her, as well as the audience, to question any preconceived notions of gender, sexuality, family and love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/19fy253OBHCNTghvIMrrp2QqvAS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Me Salma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
