I think this was my favorite out of all of the workouts.  I liked the combination of movements.  Goblet Squats – Lawnmower rows – Split Stance lunge with a shoulder press – RDL – Skull Crushers and Chest presses.  These moves progress in round two the goblet squat adds a curl – the split stance lunch add a push press –  the deadlift becomes a one-legged deadlift – during your skull crusher you lift your legs and the chest press is harder with an iso hold.  The work to rest ratio also changes from round to round.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tP20lsHuQwuRapDG3nYqVRHF5CZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men's Health The Anarchy Workout: Phase 1 Endurance","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
