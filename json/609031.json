Thus, when he gets a generous job offer which might help him realise his dream, he jumps at the chance; he soon sets off to record the sounds of animals indigenous to Ukraine and also a rare bird native to the Carpathians. The situation proves somewhat more complicated when Vadym’s companion on the trip turns out to be his mother… To the sounds of a synthesized music score, debuting Ukrainian director Antonio Lukich unfolds a visually creative road movie, in which he demonstrates a highly unusual talent for constructing tragicomic situations.","popularity":2.569,"poster_path":"/9DOmWktaCDJtUfXq3hT7RQ8QUkg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120869,"logo_path":"/4oQ3hrdkBGc9oGqouWgODiYtHXo.png","name":"Toy Cinema","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-01-02","revenue":351500,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Thoughts Are Silent","video":false,"vote_average":7.797,"vote_count":37}
