Bubbles of bad luck come out of his mouth. When one of the bubbles follows somebody, it throws a spell on that person. And the victim is sent into a tailspin of misery and bad luck where the worst that can possibly happen always does, right up until death, in the most incredible circumstances (but meaningless for the other protagonists) ends his or her cycle of bad luck. With dark, scathing irony, the “Badluck” Chronicles will allow you to have a great deal of fun at somebody else’s expense. And you won’t even feel guilty about it !","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7XLhAIairzK9rFVi5owKwscDEpm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42875,"logo_path":"/s4g5EWVd5eDCeoNuai757G15i8W.png","name":"Je suis bien content","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12434,"logo_path":"/9rfMaAC5f84cCmmVmYv29nGkdY1.png","name":"Autour de Minuit","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Need to Teach a Bear to Fly","title":"Sticky Ends","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
