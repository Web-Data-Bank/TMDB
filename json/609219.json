She is lost and restless, invested by a whirlwind of blurred memories of her childhood. One day she goes to the prison to visit a man with whom she will reminisce about the vicissitudes of Silvia, a drug-addicted girl who was in and out of her daughter's life. Rosaria, a strong grandmother who gave up helping her own daughter to raise her granddaughter. And finally of Silvia's friend, French Julien, with his life punctuated by letters and poems, who had an almost paternal affection for Alice. But Alice did not go to Julien just to take stock of her family; she wants to know if he is her father. She will unexpectedly find the strength to return to her life and smile, not after that answer, but thanks to a boy who, like her, is connected to Julien's past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qLCaSVd99SKwFqHdVz6orjvb1fg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I bambini della sua vita","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
