They seduce hundreds of spectators with their beauty, which has to do with mimicry, the transvestite does not copy, but simulates. Night after night a man ceases to be one in order to become the metaphor of a camouflage that delights other men. Nocturnal creatures who dream and desire, who captivate the most skeptical, as if they were imaginary apparitions that draw themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4ddvLryfaLo8bKJZALXMpvvIizo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Make Up","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
