In 2007 Margaret Lunt left her long-time home in Niagara Falls, Ontario and moved to Montreal to live with her son. It was shortly afterwards, that filmmaker Donald Winkler embarked on a project that would explore what lay behind that series of photographs, uncovering in the process a poignant family history, a woman's determination to be her own person, how readily she threw off her own deepest cultural conditioning when she discovered both her sons were gay and a most unique and inspiring relationship between mother and son. The result...is Margaret & Evergon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hLnJutAdrxutWnC1ubazfokBsdm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margaret & Evergon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
