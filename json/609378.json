He goes in search of the slightest clue to try to find out if this little pony, which he had nicknamed Peach, was really meant for him. Through his encounters, he discovers the codes and stereotypes in force in the world of toys and evokes, beyond the clichés with which he was associated, what Peach really represented for him. Peach was not a simple figurine to be styled. He had become a real confidant to whom he confided his budding desires for boys and his growing questions about the norm of love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mN0oAgg95jolwisbvEzx0kPk3cW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pêche, mon petit poney","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
