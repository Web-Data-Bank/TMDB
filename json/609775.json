Working with a media production team and wide range of collaborators—including color experts, facial roboticists, hair stylists, voice actors, fight choreographers and VFX engineers—Kato directs the execution of his story about a non-sighted fighter and a telepath searching for a mysterious ghost in a future world. His pursuit becomes a deep interrogation of how sensory environments are perceived and rendered, offering new ways for viewers to think through their own assumptions about cinema and imagination. -JAPAN CUTS: Festival of New Japanese Film","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ytMZgBo9m3VJxaV2Z20vj8RLYHc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NIGHT CRUISING","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
