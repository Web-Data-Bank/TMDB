The prosecution needs to prove the guilt of the 94-year-old Reinhold Hanning who worked as an SS guard at the Auschwitz concentration camp and says that he had not a clue about what was happening within its walls. Then the 3D model of the Auschwitz as it used to be is created, and the jurors are given VR-helmets so that they can step into the Unterscharführer’s shoes and make a moral choice that he had once faced. Then they will make their own decision in real life by finding him guilty or not guilty in being involved in a hundred and fifty thousands of murders.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qe1kulFpKhJUGd9LLp0LmQGpCzX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nazi VR","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
