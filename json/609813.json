It is a mystery how director Hillel Rate managed to persuade them to let the camera so close, to invite the filming crew into their home and share their most private moments. Moshe Mishuris, a 37-year-old lonely Ashkenazi Jew came from Russia with his elderly father, and now they live together in one tiny apartment. Their main source of income is donations from the audience of their YouTube channel, where they talk about Judaism in Russian. Moshe is single, he had proposed to different women twice, but it didn’t work out. When he goes to the matchmaker and it’s hard to tell whether he is hoping to get together with someone or is fearing it. The most unexpected thing is that the film is open-ended. The director leaves Moshe perplexed, but not alone because in any case he stays with his father, a man who is almost a saint and dedicated his entire life to his faith.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Father's Son","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
