Strictly speaking, it is a video to a rap track mixed from a recorded monologue of an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor Janine and complemented with couplets by a young American rapper Kapoo. The symphony of life and memory, of rhythm and words, performed by means of radical montage, tells about a mysterious person by the name of Edek.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edek","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
