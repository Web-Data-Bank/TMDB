White balance, overlaid images, rendering. You have to put up with his moods, his narcissism, his disregard of your needs. How do you manage to maintain yourself in the face of all that, and is it still better than being alone? Behind the power relations there is viscerality. We see a man’s torso, “Picasso’s”, smeared in melted vanilla ice-cream, taking selfies. Does power trickle down, like viscous liquid on skin? Do you think you are better off alone? Picasso reverted to a beast as he grew less understood with age, and with this secured his status. We don't know what is going on in our world but Picasso continues to exist in his tunnel vision.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picasso","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
