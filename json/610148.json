Her mode of living is persistently challenged by an older brother, whose caring and love come with a strive to transform her sister. The sibling drama takes a new turn upon the goth's encounter with a dance prodigy whose brilliance seems to leave everyone else in darkness. The film draws from the thoughts of the philosopher and activist Simone Weil (1909-1943), medievalism and cyberculture amongst other influences, viewing work, art and dance as war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ihpnveOY81KPs3CTrfMuM8mXdOn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
