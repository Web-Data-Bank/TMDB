We can hear the projectors at each end of the room, which project images on the central screen. We can see the same scene on each side of the screen: a woman, seen from the front and front back depending on the side of the screen, painting it with spray paint. A man then tears up the screen and goes through it, followed by the woman. We can see Michael Snow sitting further away, giving instructions to the woman. We can also see the cameras filming the scene from each side. Visitors in the room can walk around the screen and thus watch the scene from one angle or another. Both films are projected in synchronicity on the two sides of the screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ktMQHeftAr5aNym9DGYW6MMto5W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Sides to Every Story","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
