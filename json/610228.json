The 90-year-old master was in attendance at the tribute event and was interviewed on camera. Film clips aside, King of the Movies relies almost entirely on the brilliance of King’s storytelling, which entertains, illuminates and charms. Elegantly dressed in his typical late-period style of bowtie and horn-rimmed glasses, resembling a professor of American history, King reminisces on half a century in “the strangest business in the world”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o1OpC9lvBJR7NSLymelQ3tlK0sN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King of the Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
