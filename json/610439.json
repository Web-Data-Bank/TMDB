Esta es mi Cara – This is My Face explores what happens when a group of men living with the virus open up about the chronic disease that changed their life trajectories. The film follows a creative process whereby the protagonists produce photographic portraits that represent their (often painful) memories and feelings, a process that helps them challenge years of silence, shame, and misrepresentations. A lesson in the power of collaborative storytelling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ulKBR23Wn7w1kS8b80YaeCOWatJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cerebro Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2019-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What lies inside a journey with HIV","title":"This Is My Face","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
