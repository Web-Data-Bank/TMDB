By day he dutifully prays at the local synagogue and manages a busy dry cleaner.

When he misplaces his black hat along the way, Shmuel’s two lives will interconnect in a way he never expected.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bjmnEKBerB9fLS9bOqEVdGITRTP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Hat","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
