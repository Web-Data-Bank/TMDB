A gang of Norwegian children do what Norwegian children like best - ski. They are actually rescuing Norwegian gold from the nazi invaders. The Nazis search all adults but don't suspect children playing. The children carry the gold, one bar at a time, across the mountains to a fishing boat. It is a race against time, it is spring and the snow is melting. So they ski from dawn to dusk every day.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/nvEOGvh5HrRIt1UUplS0MahbzVc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sagittarius Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snow Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
