Aloof and detached, Alberto comes from a wealthy family. Driven and focused, Juan is reared by a devoted mother whose affection makes up for the absence of his father. Juan and his mother survive in a tough and impoverished Barrio on the outskirts of the capital city. Behind every happy moment lies an ominous sense of despair. Yet the joyful Dominican way of life for those surviving on the margins serves as a testament to people anywhere confronted with poverty and injustice.","popularity":0.712,"poster_path":"/yjVFlu1YCmQMEdadJzYaoCUN5Nz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15098,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antena Latina Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"}],"release_date":"2007-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yuniol","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
