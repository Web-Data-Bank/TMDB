VH1 is rewriting the script on its critically acclaimed music franchise “VH1 Storytellers,” and for the first time in network history, the series will be broadcast LIVE from a venue of special meaning to the performing artist. In this tradition, Sheeran will perform and share personal stories from his life that have inspired his chart-topping songs from Whelan’s in Dublin, the venue where he first saw the artist that made him want to pursue music — Damien Rice.  “It’s amazing to come back to perform at a place that means so much to me personally,” says Sheeran. “I was only about 11 or 12 years old when I saw Damien play at Whelan’s, and that night literally changed my life. The time he spent talking with me after the show made all the difference. It inspired me in a way that I only hope to do for someone else.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qo533kmdHeQlSJBOnxv1jA8KLbw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17627,"logo_path":null,"name":"VH1 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ed Sheeran: VH1 Storytellers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
