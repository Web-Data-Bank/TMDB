The more I was shocked about how the disabled were depicted in this film the more I started to realize that in every non-disabled TV counterpart of this show (German TV shows like \"Popstars\" or \"Friedmann\" or the home shopping channels) its mentally \"non-handicapped\" participants are treated in a completely identical way: The total prostitution of the mind in front a huge TV audience at the expense of one's most important gifts one should hang on to: dignity. On the other hand one could completely understand people who are furious about \"exploiting\" these handicapped persons. But that's what Schlingensief's works are all about: shock people and don't care about those who cannot or will not try to get the message (if there is one).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jLRCPyT7ArpMNbzQmcUV59mkhkK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17178,"logo_path":"/eXbcwmrHmVmgmRFPoYZfbLkt884.png","name":"Filmgalerie 451","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freakstars 3000","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
