Sixty years after \"THE PLANETS\" was written, internationally renowned keyboard artist and composer Isao Tomita created a highly popular electronic version of the Holst suite. It is \"THE TOMITA PLANETS\" that award-winning Director Don Barrett has chosen for the soundtrack of his musical video grand tour of the Solar System.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qZSO3wJBKyEW1H90eSiFtfEynIu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Planets","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
