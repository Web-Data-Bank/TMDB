There were 4,000 fans in attendance and the show drew a 5.0 rating on TBS. The Master Blasters debuted at this event, however, after approximately one week Iron was replaced by Blade. Ric Flair was disqualified due to interference by Stan Hansen. After their match, Sting attempted to unmask the Black Scorpion, tearing away his black mask only to reveal a red mask underneath. The Scorpion quickly escaped when the \"real\" Black Scorpion appeared on the entrance ramp. Although he was never truly unmasked, the Black Scorpion that Sting wrestled was Al Perez.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/ikRwERPA6yRNftfCrpwc3JRxxKe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13510,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Championship Wrestling (WCW)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WCW Clash of The Champions XII: Fall Brawl '90: Mountain Madness","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
