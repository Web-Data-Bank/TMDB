To prevent panic, the officials go in dressed as tourists (who are dressed so casually that the pilots assume that they are all gay). The pilots are not to make themselves known and can't contact the rescue team. The secrecy causes a comedy of errors including the desolate Greek Isle deciding that since tourists have now arrived, they have to become touristy.","popularity":2.305,"poster_path":"/saLLEfLbqXIpdh5mrZoUcuGnT85.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Cacoyannis Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1967-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Day the Fish Came Out","video":false,"vote_average":5.25,"vote_count":10}
