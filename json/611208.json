This program is designed to build on the first program in the series. Pilates trains the mind and body to work together toward your goal of overall fitness. Move even closer by increasing the total length of our workout and by introducing some even more challenging movements. Most importantly, we'll pay attention to the principles of the work of founder Joseph Pilates: concentration, control, centering, fluidity, precision, and breath. For a modification to accommodate limitations, watch guest Tara Russell. The power each of us holds to take control over our own being is immense. Use this intermediate mat workout regularly to help you learn to blend the power of your mind with the power of your body.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Dx04bNH9j1dFtUOOX0EjID24LP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pilates Intermediate Mat Workout","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
