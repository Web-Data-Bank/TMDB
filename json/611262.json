Fearing the the thief/thieves are supernatural in nature, the owner of the statue hires mystics to investigate its disappearance.\r It's the characters in this anime production that make it enjoyable. The villian of the film doesn't steal the statue because he's evil and wants to `destroy the world' which would be typical in a lesser film. No, instead in this, the villian was born with a skill that was relatively useless in today's society but has found an outlet to really show off what he can do.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1cl8GAJyORoHuBJ1Vf8zg5R1bID.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirit Warrior: Regent of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
