He hitches a ride on a passing comet, but quickly finds himself thrown into jail by people who see him as an invader, rather than a friendly visitor. The Moon Man, however, has a most unusual - but perfectly logical - means of escape, and sets out to make his way back home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lF0dpWjM2I7rE0fjWKwTHTAEGa4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha","origin_country":"XC"},{"id":13636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moon Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
