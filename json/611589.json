One day she hires a girl and offers her a necklace against a mysterious job. Madame Anaïs's former husband, the count, immediately falls in love with the girl who is dressed as a teenager. After whetting his appetite on the maid, the count expects a very nice time with the girl and they quickly find themselves together in bed. After the first lovemaking, the young lady asks for more, which he provides but gets exhausted and begs for mercy. The girl, by putting a piece of cloth round his neck and nearly strangling him, brings his strength back. Then she definitely strangles him and leaves the house after receiving the necklace from Madame Anaïs (the countess), who then bursts into tears.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le clandé aux partouzes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
