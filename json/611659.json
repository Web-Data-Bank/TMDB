Natural settings are transformed through time-lapse animation, while ten discrete cyclic animations occur simultaneously in a bank of windows behind the motionless protagonist. NO ACTION contrasts sound and imagery to describe conflicting internal and external realities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zbXfQMGZ19sH1teKdgs4SEVfcAX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Action","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
