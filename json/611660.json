A baseball movie for the initiated, it includes references to Roberto Clemente, Bill Mazeroski, Dock Ellis and the legendary 1960 Pirates versus Yankees World Series. Bruno Sammartino also gets a mention, but my after-the-fact research indicates that Bruno was a professional wrestler and not a baseball player. There are so many details to keep track of in making a film. Anyway, this film also contains the world's longest baseball joke.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quick Opener","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
