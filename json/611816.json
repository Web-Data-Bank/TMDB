The object photographed is rice. I placed rice one by one and then took them away one by one on an Acrylic desk. I took a photograph when I placed a grain of rice or I changed the direction of light. I used 465 grains of rice and took 1355 photographs. Then I jointed the 1355 photographs together in software and edited them to be a moving-image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
