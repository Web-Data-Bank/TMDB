The pages reveal the experiences of World War II, love and separation, and a subtly ironic view on the events in the Soviet Union and among its society. The Little Bird looks at the world from the viewpoint of a small creature rather than from a perspective of power and politics which may be the reason her life story seems so incredibly heartwarming, familiar, and true to the tiniest detail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tL0yuqqrXf3l9J8u4Alt0Ghc4Na.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studija Centrums","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2007-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Bird’s Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
