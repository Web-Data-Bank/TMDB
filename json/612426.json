Trinity’s submissive partner, Baby, is by her side as she journeys in and out of reality on this wild ride of John Waters–style queer spirituality and alternative sexuality. Absurdity, kink, and camp abound in this film filled with the cream of Chicago’s queer artist community, including the infamous Imp Queen.","popularity":0.892,"poster_path":"/ckm9rvifEB9wH9mFoJEiV5PE4bq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166376,"logo_path":null,"name":"Full Spectrum Features","origin_country":""},{"id":61604,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forager Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a dominatrix... who can speak to the dead.","title":"Holy Trinity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
