A group of German soldiers huddle round to keep the heat, smoking cigarettes in buildings almost reduced to rubble telling tales of a one man wrecking ball who seems impervious to German bullets, striking fear into the hearts of Wehrmacht and Schutzstaffel alike. No, it's not the skull cracking, baseball bat wielding Bear Jew, it's not Stepan Petrenko the deadeye sharpshooting Russian, this man is those two combined and then some, It's the Nazi-crushing, Panzer-eating Dick Dynamite.","popularity":3.07,"poster_path":"/ckbFKiq4Mwc31D0TiLynGg64jd1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dick Dynamite: 1944","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
