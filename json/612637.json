It's all pretty yikes but here's what it said on the download page:  \"Four young women have been abducted from that greatest of american icons, the shopping mall. Those jihadist bastards! The girls donâ€™t seem to understand the gravity of the situation, as hooded men drive them to a secluded area. Eventually, they realize the depth of trouble they are in. Their first hint is when they are tied to posts, forced to strip and shot to death. Four bodies for the pit. Four fewer consumers.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gS1wFjqbZsPv1Uk6ye5XRk5QxYZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shopping Mall Jihad","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
