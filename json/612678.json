Brother’s divorce brings ceaseless conflict to the family. Disputes over custody of his kid and alimony constantly plague him, but I can neither help him nor ignore his troubles. Boyfriend seems to be selfish and makes me nervous. There are always anxieties lurking below the surface of any human relationships. This anxiety becomes incarnated in the shadowy face of a pervert hiding in the alley, and darkness has its metaphorical meaning in the entire film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60264,"logo_path":"/dufUwEz5RcpEDe8UZtyXcFE5Yxa.png","name":"Korea National University of Arts","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warm Swamp","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
