The film explores our hunger to find fulfillment through acts of committing to—and straying from—our partners and how the secrets we keep--and the lies we tell--in our search for love and desire reveal who we are. It is also the story of the director’s unexpected transformation, as she discovers her future partner through the process of making the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l45IuJAD7eTfBwxWzyTQCoJsrbj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123968,"logo_path":null,"name":"Incomplete Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talking About Adultery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
