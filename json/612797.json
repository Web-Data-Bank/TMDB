Our Love is a half-documentary, half-narrative telling the stories of Xiang Xiang, Ping Er and Raorao. Xiang Xiang is pretty and attractive, Ping Er smart and funny, Raorao honest and passionate. Physically speaking, they are male; but psychologically they are not. Issues such as homosexuality, transsexuality, and cross-dress are all touched upon in the film. Those who are different from heterosexual people are by no means perverts; their presence throws light on the ignored violence which has been taken for granted in the heterosexual world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1GqqDREXo2n8mIWvzE72gI5mDau.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
