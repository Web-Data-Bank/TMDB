In one scene, shot in the director’s hotel room, an actor played the part of a character whom the filmmakers passed off as Cali Cartel’s Number Three. They claimed they had risked their lives to get the interview. One sequence also shows a man pretending to swallow capsules of heroine and transporting them to London in his stomach. This phoney TV documentary is an international smash hit. When a London daily discovers that the whole thing is a hoax, a team of British journalists are sent out to Colombia to cover the story. Their report unleashes a scandal that shakes the very foundations of television in the UK.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":"/sxqUh9blio7r5pR73hLkliphTSD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2005-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
