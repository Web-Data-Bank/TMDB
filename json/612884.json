Both audio and video of that special performance are now set for release on June 28. This historic performance at the Beacon offered an opportunity for Doobie fans to hear deep cuts and songs never-before performed live by the band, such as “Mamaloi,” “O’Connelly Corners,” “Ukiah,” and “The Captain And Me.” The show begins with the 10 songs from the group’s second studio album, Toulouse Street.
