It expresses my interest in the human form and how two human forms can come together in various ways. My morphology teacher was also a dancer and he is the one in black moving with the white me in the cube. The film also includes photos I took, a number with multiple exposures, and drawings I did from the photos and from the work of Eadweard Muybridge, whose studies in motion inspired me.\" - Penny Slinger","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hGKyn58SOPDl4PmePJnxwXPwm7T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rhythm of Two Figures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
