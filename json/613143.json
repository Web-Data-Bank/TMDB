In the beginning of this experimental film a figure in white ascends spiral staircases and escalators and moves away from the camera down endless tunnels and corridors. A model in a black leotard is painted white, turned into art. Another is filmed as she ascends to a rooftop, then confronts herself in a mirror in a corner of a room. As Alice went through the glass, so in the last section there are two women reflecting each other instead of just the one.\" - Penny Slinger","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/mepwVLAWEflcv1yDdhfsIpsbLPr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stairs, Tunnels and Mirrors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
