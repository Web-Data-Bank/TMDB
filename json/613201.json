In the third year after she started living in Germany, Shiota became sharply aware of her own skin, arguably a symbol of her own  identity. This was the first work where she made a video version of a performance. It also resonates with her 1997 performance piece, “Try and Go  Home.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/igv9nhEMmX3nLiMy2hk4gAdGuqX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bathroom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
