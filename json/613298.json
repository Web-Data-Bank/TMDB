Bulat connects Moa Pillar to the local music community, so that Moa can collaborate with folk musicians who represent the tradition deeply rooted in the history of the country and its inner struggles. The collaboration experiment reveals a clash between century-old traditions and modern culture of millennials and makes both heroes doubt the possibility of a dialogue between two worlds they represent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5pENN4ZFputO0gZuHbEY1SKjbH7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102895,"logo_path":"/l7vxt0fHlxH0mgPScm1a2Sv4ZZS.png","name":"Stereotactic","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonfires and Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
