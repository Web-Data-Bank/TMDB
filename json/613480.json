Unfavourable circumstances not only affect the original purpose of their trip but also begin to impact the relationship between Nasser and his son, Waleed. Indeed, the interaction with their relatives exposes a serious underlying problem: much to his father’s disapproval, Waleed doesn’t identify with the strong traditions that have been upheld for generations. Through its story of a family encounter the film adopts a realistic approach to gradually uncover the divide between the rural community and the more liberal-minded inhabitants of Riyadh. In so doing the work presents a critique of deeply rooted Islamic customs and seeks to establish the extent to which patriarchy determines paternal love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ybj3Zk7vju5NAGw8sCTVfcibMfv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","name":"Saudi Arabia"}],"release_date":"2019-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Visit","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
