They had 3 hit singles and a UK top 10 album already under their belts along with a string of headlining concerts, all of which had come since their relocation from New York to London in 1980. The band's combination of original songs and rockabilly classics with a punk attitude and style had caught the moment to perfection. Added to this were their considerable musical accomplishments and knack for songwriting. All in all it was a heady concoction and the crowd in Montreux reacted with near hysterical excitement, something rarely seen in what is usually a polite and reserved audience. This is the Stray Cats at their peak.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bS6JNwkWBPo9muLHyJMvQyXiWJZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stray Cats: Live at Montreux 1981","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
