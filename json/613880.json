Greg adopted the travel as a lifestyle and made me share his daily life spent on the road. In his philosophy of travel, Greg has established five different degrees equivalent to five different ways to travel. I realized over the adventures and encounters that have been made on the roads of Eastern Europe, India and the United States that there was a sixth degree; a degree that, when it reaches you, change your perception of the world and its multiple realities. A sixth degree that transports you or destroys you.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jRggyxpp1HIJVo3JPJN0rQCd8du.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le degré 6 du voyageur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
