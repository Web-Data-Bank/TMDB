Since the publication of his first book in 1963, John McGahern was at the cultural heart of Irish life.  He was in the happy position of being universally praised by the critics and equally loved by the reading public. John McGahern: A Private World was filmed in 2004 just prior to the publication of his memoirs and these memoirs form the backbone of the documentary. Through intimate interviews, a strong and compelling sense of the man emerges, offering a rare insight into the creative process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harvest Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John McGahern: A Private World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
