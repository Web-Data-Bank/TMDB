Suddenly, while the class is visiting Robert Harrisâ€™ famous painting The Fathers of Confederation, John A. MacDonald comes to life from the painting and speaks to the students, explaining the Canadian Constitution and the reasons for it. This lively animated meditation on history and art is an engaging portal to the lessons of the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1950-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1867 and After","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
