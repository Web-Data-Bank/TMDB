Repeating his stage role, Andrew Mack essays the title character, a brawling Irish boy of a few centuries back. While swashbuckling his way through the Auld Sod, the Ragged Earl meets the aristocratic Kathleen Fitzmorris (Ormi Hawley), who is disguised as a boy to escape an arranged marriage with the wealthy but decrepit Lord Wildbrook (Edward Peil Sr.). Entering into the spirit of things, our hero disguises himself as Wildbrook, escorts Kathleen back home, and marries her himself, right under the noses of her unsuspecting parents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":86399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Popular Plays and Players Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ragged Earl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
