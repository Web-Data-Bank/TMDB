DMX commands arena stages, wrecks his competition in battles, and takes time to show fans some tough love. Leading off this two-hour tale of the X is the 20-minute short \"Angel\" directed by Bill Duke. It's a mini-movie about DMX's rise to super-stardom and his constant fight with evil. Co-stars Mary J. Blige. View \"Angel\" once and then forget about it... the rest of the DVD is what makes it a must-have. \"Tales of X\" is a look into the life and times of DMX. You can finally hear him, understand him and enter his world. \"One More Road to Cross\" documents step-by-step how X and his team lay down an album in the studio and the creative and emotional intensity surrounding the process. A full taste of DMX in front of a hometown audience is given by \"Survival of the Illest\" shot during his legendary 1999 performance at the Apollo Theater.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nXSgiUDcH9ZJLcSvabJAWRsYIK3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78156,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Island Def Jam Music Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One More Road to Cross","title":"DMX: Angel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
