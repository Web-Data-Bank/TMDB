They don't do it for money, they do it for scares, and for support and love. Many of the spooks have suffered from bullying, depression, dysfunctional family, and being treated as outcasts. The haunt is their home and the other spooks are their family. Rather than do other \"bad things\" they take out their aggressions scaring patrons every Halloween and they build each other upper, laugh, cry, and scare as a haunt family. It's scary, funny, and shocking. Join the family of fear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4LvH0VIHamF649ytzy6p0AGSOY9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some families are born of blood, and others are just bathed in it.","title":"Family of Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
