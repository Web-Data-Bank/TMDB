They quickly realise that something may be coming from the lake that is affecting their minds and the passing of time. As they lose their inhibitions their most primal desires take hold. Lured on by the unseen entity it seems that only one of the team is permitted to bond with it and so be reborn in a new physical body. A terrifying game of strategy not to survive, but rather to die with the promise of life anew.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nqBJZ9DJA89dsW9oYri4qmJFZZq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landing Lake","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
