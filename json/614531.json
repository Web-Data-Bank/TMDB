Bill, who is engaged to Helen, Dykeman's daughter, routs the gang when they try to dispossess settlers and subsequently eludes a large posse. Later, when Hawley steals a gold shipment, Bill captures him and returns the gold to the Blue Ridge settlers; he is then accused of the robbery, but again he escapes. Disguised as a Spaniard, Bill meets Hawley and discovers him to be his father's murderer; a fight ensues, and Hawley recovers the map and kidnaps Helen in a stagecoach. Bill gives chase, overpowers the villain, and rescues Helen from the burning stagecoach.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/viVX9VndmYBmykuOWIZ81nbxDde.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Myron Selznick","origin_country":""},{"id":14032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Path√© Exchange","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arizona Whirlwind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
