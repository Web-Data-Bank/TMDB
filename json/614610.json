On the periphery of historical events, the heroes of the film argue about faith. All of them will have to go through trials and find out if their faith is strong or is it just a mask under which they hide their weaknesses? Everyone answers this question in their own way.

The events of one day and one night divide the life of the heroes into “before” and “after”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/34mmwVkp9ijqlTyIe9MIKpzYSAm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Name Faith","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
