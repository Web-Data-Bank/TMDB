Shot in Kazakhstan, where Chizhevsky was imprisoned and later exiled, the film introduces Сhizhevsky’s research into the impact of solar emissions on human sociology, psychology, politics, and economics in the form of wars, revolutions, epidemics, and other upheavals. It aligns the life of post-Soviet rural residents and the futurological projects of Russian cosmism to emphasize that the goal of the early Soviet breakthroughs aimed at the conquest of outer space was not so much technical acceleration, but the common cause of humankind in their struggle against the limitations of earthly life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1c6JfdMFZ8uwg9tpoznr9DA8mMM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125235,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haus der Kulturen der Welt","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Communist Revolution Was Caused By The Sun","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
