José Saramago, 1998 Nobel Laureate in Literature, has a heteronym, Ricardo Reis, return to Portugal after a 16-year exile in Brazil. 1936 is a perilous year with Mussolini’s fascism, Hitler’s Nazism, Spain’s Civil War and Salazar’s New State in Portugal. And Fernando Pessoa meets his creation, Reis. Two women, Lídia and Marcenda, are Reis’ carnal and impossible passions. “Life and Death as one” allows for literature and cinema.","popularity":0.995,"poster_path":"/z9J9DFwTbimW1CGaGZCp0jystV3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28195,"logo_path":"/vZZFoeY1RlQDlidjvK0rSyUTVSA.png","name":"Ar de Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3}
