Revisiting his old gambling haunts, he meets Saeko, a striking young upper-class woman who is out seeking thrills, and whose presence adds spice to the staid masculine underworld rituals. Muraki becomes her mentor while simultaneously coping with the shifts of power that have affected the gangs while he was interred. When he notices a rogue, drug-addicted young punk hanging around the gambling dens, he realizes that Saeko's insatiable lust for intense pleasures may be leading her to self-destruction.","popularity":5.273,"poster_path":"/xI8duNuJ9ArNZZ6Jc1CbJSOXtzd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ninjin Club","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1964-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pale Flower","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":81}
