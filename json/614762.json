The film was created from footage shot at Phil Hoffman's independent imaging retreat in Ontario as well as from footage shot in Vancouver (where I had given myself the challenge of shooting 100 feet of film every month). All of the footage was hand-processed, and some of it was contact printed by hand and treated in baths of potassium ferricyanide. The final film was created through various optical printing techniques.\" â€” Amanda Dawn Christie","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iDGyEbeII62XOsUA6qsHres5TNB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knowledge of Good and Evil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
