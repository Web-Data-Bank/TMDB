The floor gleams, the spotlights are burning, the narration starts.  Born out of a fascination for the construction that is Hollywood, and by extension ‘the perfect Hollywood home’, the maker embodies three actresses from Hollywood’s golden era and their so-called private lives. Their smallest personality traits are performed so precise and characteristically that it becomes artificial. The home isn’t homely. It plays “house” and the inhabitants are speaking Hollywoodian. In this setting, the maker of the film recalls memories of growing up in her childhood home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8fJ5mvWuPZt3iMMur5T1W0DpT16.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blauwhuis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The reliability of memory is being questioned when, set within the highly constructed world of Old Hollywood, the filmmaker recalls memories of her childhood home.","title":"Ordinary Things (that happened in the childhood home of the maker of this film)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
