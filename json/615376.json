Three online video creators are trying in vain to create a viral video. They have cute, boring spots that are largely ignored on YouTube-and they have increasingly impatient investors. Enter a mysterious consultant whose videos have garnered millions of hits-by dispensing with good taste. Overjoyed by their newfound success, the team pops out one popular video after another, from Sasquatch and Yeti in a curling match to \"Breast Feeding While Driving\". But as their business starts to take off, they realize that they know nothing about their consultant. Co-writer/director Taylor Guterson (Old Goats) partnered with Erik Alskog (co-writer/director, cast-member) to produce Viral Viral -- a darkly comedic tale of the crackpot underbelly of public media where nothing is off-limits in the quest for hits.","popularity":0.638,"poster_path":"/vpUpi9wjCUqxEEOCGVkiAOjYxfB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just how low will they go for a YouTube sensation?","title":"Viral Viral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
