Filmed in a gay bar, the roving camera hesitates on a woman’s face, on some lilies, on small groups of people drinking and enjoying themselves and on the proverbial kiss between two women.

A sublime fantasy, with pleasure as protest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/co3nZnNC0s9s5uqInK0b624f9bu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Wanted Green Lawns","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
