Many canvases, hitherto believed to be by the hand of the Master, are now thought to be the work of artists who learnt their craft in his studio by copying his style. The film is a fascinating study of modern scientific techniques, a comprehensive art historical view of Rembrandtâ€™s work over the centuries and a reaffirmation of his genius.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iM61OzJfJ0mcsoRWMcdJtyEkHJC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Rembrandt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
