A seventeen-minute masterpiece that has precisely to do with the act of transmission. I have found a very powerful similarity between the film that is at the origin of this short - The Clock, by Vincente Minnelli-  and Rossellini's Viaggio in Italia. We could continue elaborating and extract a thread from this.  I find it very exciting to be able to start pulling this thread with a film that has been made this year (2019), instead of starting with its birth.\" - Paulino Viota","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8vhhjJaiwE3r8X8uPnw6N8yBEy0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97760,"logo_path":"/4ZKbXGBg1aR6PuNjw8SGf55USq7.png","name":"Dublin Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The night.
