In the spirit of daredevil Evel Knievel, Hodges recently attempted to jump farther than anyone ever has on a motorcycle – a distance that was set in 2011 at 378 feet and 9 inches by Robbie Maddison – and severely injured both ankles prior to the live show. In the revamped show, beginning at 9pm ET, exclusive crash footage of Hodges will be revealed and four-time X Games Medalist Vicki Golden will aim to set a new world record in an epic live motorcycle firewall stunt.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4DfM02uWR2ue21AeELGnmgRmcDo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116082,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nitro Circus Media Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evel Live 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
