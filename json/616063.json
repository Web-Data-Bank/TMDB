Without the warm glow of Luke's love, she is lost in the shadows of despair and forced into submission by nurse Broadfield. When Annie discovers a cottage hidden in Farthinggale's woods, the mystery of her past deepens. Even as she yearns to see Luke again, her hopes and dreams are darkened by the sinister Casteel spell.","popularity":6.361,"poster_path":"/oRE2h2p6qDh6W4euUMV38FZMRy5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3431,"logo_path":"/bVTF0p5xlPfQhQIuBLr9BFtrKip.png","name":"Lifetime","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3958,"logo_path":"/xkdYNmOW6e4gjgp4NSLRt0W5UIj.png","name":"Front Street Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gates of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":10}
