His four children, however, fell short once they grew up and had to fend for themselves. When Appleton dies, his widow (Lydia Knott) explains that his last request was that each child spend one hour of contemplation with his body. The first is the youngest daughter, Daisy (Rosemary Theby), an artist of note who was betrayed and left with a son to raise out of wedlock. Next is Luke (Milton Sills), a wild young man who ran away at 19, and even though he is now married and a father, he still can't quite settle down. The eldest son, Bob (Wilfred Lucas), is next -- he wed a wealthy woman, but the marriage has no love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mH0GjUqDltW7hlfhIuL1yUYEWlO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harry Garson Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hushed Hour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
