In a century of assaults on K2, only about 300 people have ever seen the view from the planet's second highest peak. More than a quarter of those who made it didn't live long enough to share the glory. At the heart of this documentary lies a mystery about one extraordinary Irishman, Ger McDonnell. At the very limit of his physical resources, he faced a heartbreaking dilemma. Through recreations, archive and home movie footage, and interviews with survivors and families, the film creates a forensic, vivid version of events that is emotive, engrossing and, at times, deeply shocking.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lY5z2wRHQ1AWGw4rdm5OCvzek7a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K2: The Killer Summit","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
