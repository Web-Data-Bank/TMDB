A legend says that she returned to Earth as a ghost and still roams the streets of Moscow alongside her free-drifting descendants. While shooting this film, the directors little by little realised that they knew the street dogs only as part of our human world; they have never looked at humans as a part of the dogs’ world.","popularity":1.083,"poster_path":"/fEEyn6IG3HvqtQvH3mL4YrYYCCt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120891,"logo_path":null,"name":"RAUMZEITFILM Produktion","origin_country":""},{"id":87110,"logo_path":null,"name":"IT WORKS!
