But for now they exist in a malaise of dissatisfaction. Soldiers from the local military post provide them some companionship and society, but nothing can suffice to replace Moscow in their hopes. Andrei marries a provincial girl, Natasha, and begins to settle into a life of much less meaning than he had hoped. Natasha begins to run the family her way. Masha, though married, yearns for the sophisticated life and begins a dalliance with Vershinin, an army officer with a sick and suicidal wife. Even Irina, the freshest, most optimistic of the sisters, begins to waver in her dreams until, finally, tragedy strikes.","popularity":0.633,"poster_path":"/fGSXU7gAZFhhkykFVfrg2AU3Olb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Commonwealth United Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":111701,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Actors Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
