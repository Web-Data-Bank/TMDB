This is a wooden fairground box with the views of other countries inside and the latest world news. In fact, such a theater with paper panoramas was a prototype of TV and the Internet. On the other hand, the spelling of the name «Rayok» refers to a network slang in which the anglicisms interlace with Russian words.
