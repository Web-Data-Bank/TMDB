She’s been gripped as of late by the silence of her once-buzzing household where she raised children and grandchildren. Resigned to Argileh smoking and day-long coffee drinking on a now-empty balcony, Teta now invokes the deepest memories of her violinist husband who died twenty years ago. She claims a preparedness to re-unite with him.","popularity":0.948,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veritas Films","origin_country":""},{"id":6995,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screen Institute Beirut","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"release_date":"2011-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandma, a Thousand Times","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3}
