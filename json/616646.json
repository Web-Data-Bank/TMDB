Here, where throughout the 20th century ever enhanced methods of oil recovery, have transformed an amorphous, ambivalent and hardly populated landscape into an uncanny site of man’s supposed mastery of nature, the film traces the ways of a man, who wanders the scenes aimlessly, bound by his own implication in the menacing mechanics of oil production but drawn physically to their coevally proceeding erasure by the rough and untamed nature of this seemingly self-subsisting land.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ae4YdousR5dXPUFLeMDdCXK4Kcm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way Between Two Points","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
