A third of the population left to work in Iceland, and those who stayed behind—most of them from the older generation—are hoping for their return. But by now their children and grandchildren are settling into new lives on the other side of Europe. The distance separating them is great and the journey expensive, so they don’t get to hug each other very often. The best alternative is intensive contact by Skype.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c4FGOEOrw27uDsv9bjYjVcV2tBr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37375,"logo_path":"/fB7PTMqy1bKhXrdu4cBUsg1tnVL.png","name":"NUR","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":96298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Join Motion Pictures","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":122740,"logo_path":"/c0XQNpfyvFfyK9WxdADpl3wPYk5.png","name":"MX35","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":122741,"logo_path":"/rClfLmnwkBeBDBkpckF7iHjyuZD.png","name":"Oxymoron","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":122742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Widok","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":11240,"logo_path":"/i59ItaKFdxJ7Yi6w2s7CML0LBvI.png","name":"PISF","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":38468,"logo_path":"/3PQ5z20TfOXzea2HL3TiTJkQDxK.png","name":"Icelandic Film Centre","origin_country":"IS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Touch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
