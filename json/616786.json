Their idyllic life gets a rude shock after Kawdu (Upendra Limaye), who had gone into the forest to fetch a medicinal root for his ailing baby, is arrested on charges of having killed a tiger. Desperate to save the life of her baby, Bhulabai (Vibhawari Deshpande) rushes to a Christian missionary, and showered with care and concern, embraces Christianity under the belief that this new god has different powers from her “own” gods, and will solve her problems.  However, freeing her husband from jail is another affair, and for this she is advised to seek the help of Naxalites living in the nearby forest, through whom she acquires a new deity—Karl Marx. Even as these new gods find their place on her altar beside Waghdeo and Naagdeo, the traditional nature deities of her community, the community itself shuts the family out for having dropped its own gods.\" - Aparna Pallavi","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":"/33MTl8AgqXxpf9BuTTVfX0ZQEBn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's Your Religion?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
