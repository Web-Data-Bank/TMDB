The entire police department act immediately to identify and arrest the killer. A man in his 30s wanders down a large avenue. He wears fine clothes, he walks elegantly. His broken watch reads 18:47. The man searches his pockets for documents he cannot find. Neither he can recognize himself in the objects he carries: a wallet full of bills, a theater entrance ticket, a bloodstained handkerchief. Crossing pedestrians for whom that night will be like any other, he seeks to recover his memory and identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wmInhERM4SkHrgA8yUgbsvsWOxJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1985-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noite","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
