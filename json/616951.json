Following the budding friendship of Kelly (Kelly Lloyd, Baltimore Improv Group), a bored housewife, and Chris (Chris Milner, Comedy Central), a displaced Londoner, this film takes an honest look at life by disposing of conventional on-screen relationships. Bored exposes the inherent drama in the silences between what people say and don't say to each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bNLpgF0ufq2wF4EKoO126UXf5dd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bored in the U.S.A.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
