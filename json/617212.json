Hamka decided to travel around Medan to spread the importance of unity between the community (religious figures) and the Indonesian military, in order to prevent them from being divided. However, this effort led to Hamka being shot. Fortunately, Hamka survived and as a result of his service, he moved to Jakarta and founded Al-Azhar. However, Hamka was falsely accused of being involved in a rebellion against Soekarno. He was arrested and tortured to sign a confession letter. Hamka persisted and his experience led to him writing the most influential book in Islamic education, the Tafsir Al Azhar.","popularity":2.949,"poster_path":"/8G1bT9DSxVNX0YU4P5zijvX3pS0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14140,"logo_path":"/tYujZw7UWP1mjWv48eqsjutjqeN.png","name":"Starvision Plus","origin_country":"ID"},{"id":121036,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majelis Ulama Indonesia","origin_country":""},{"id":72761,"logo_path":"/ikOKXFh7K4Hc9ywiqCI9humBHmg.png","name":"Falcon Pictures","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2023-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Buya Hamka: Vol. II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
