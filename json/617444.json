While he rises and falls, watched by the impassive but attentive look of a woman who could be his wife, he is the protagonist of a flight into the past. Again, there is tension emphasized by an impending sound in crescendo, this time the one of the jet engine. This jump into the void is a recurrent creative preoccupation that might refer to distance, wounds, and risks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rzNbleShvcxuo0GmuL5QiueK91E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"90 Years","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
