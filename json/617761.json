In each sequence, the screen is masked out to reveal the prior sequence: each audience is successively watching the killings that we, the actual audience, have just seen. The onscreen audience never leaves the theatre – there’s nowhere else in this world beyond the cinema, and the scenes of entrapment and containment play out in similarly-framed spaces of chaos (what if what we watched onscreen leaked out?). Without a scrap of ideology-addled earnestness, the tone moves from playful to inevitable. Like a game, it all loops together in an oddly fun, self-sustaining spiral of dramatic irony.","popularity":0.632,"poster_path":"/fZmDizcrUv8LXEJuHPdUDPz1lmh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runtime","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
