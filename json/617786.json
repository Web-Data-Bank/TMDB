Along with a band of similarly cloistered young women she lives seemingly unstuck in time, cut off from modern society in a remote forest commune presided over by a man called Shepherd, a controlling, messiah-like figure with a frightening dark side. But when her insular world is rocked by a series of nightmarish visions and disturbing revelations, Selah begins to question everything about her existenceâ€”including her allegiance to the increasingly dangerous Shepherd.","popularity":10.364,"poster_path":"/ynPJkpmWNi4rnDUb0PuzDnJj5JI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81794,"logo_path":"/7mIfopwJnw4RJSHq4FI5lhRe89w.png","name":"Rumble Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":39004,"logo_path":"/oIki78o91tifO6F1R0Uy4Ff3hhq.png","name":"Subotica Entertainment","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":197210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zentropa Belgium","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":19037,"logo_path":"/tceh2aAORA5JxIZSLQ1GkzTBZDL.png","name":"uMedia","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Lamb","video":false,"vote_average":5.866,"vote_count":160}
