One cold winter morning, Dr. Fleischmann (literally, ‘man of flesh') realizes he is starting to lose his memory. So begins a morality tale, in a dream-like state in which truth and fiction become entangled and lose their contours. The main character, a scientist, is reluctantly drawn into a world - his disease - in which mysterious bonds prevail: those between fate and the biological and physiological criteria that regulate existence. The film is based on a story of the same name by Giorgio Pressburger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6LuuRM7RKqR11NGwyLltayLfqRd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121139,"logo_path":null,"name":"VOX Produzioni","origin_country":""},{"id":26742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Collective Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":317,"logo_path":"/HJj0J9Tk6AGcLpL4O7mI3bsccM.png","name":"Istituto Luce Cinecittà","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La legge degli spazi bianchi","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
