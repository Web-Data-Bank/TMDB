For over 50 years now, we have been testing our human nature in our effort to conquer outer space, and still 30 years away from a possible human exploration of Mars, a question remains: Can our body take such travels? Will it ever adapt?  Combining human adventure and the exploration of the human body, this film offers unique insights into the physical and psychological effects of space travel on the Astronauts and measures the impact on medical sciences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bbO5EQVoZebW1T3uBQgS7U2oJsM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121169,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gorgone Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":99153,"logo_path":"/yzBcprlxcZ3A2x7EfYlOSIVHbKM.png","name":"Cocottesminute Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":75242,"logo_path":"/pviLhXu8yVavzS2Z1pthpv9Z4w5.png","name":"Pictanovo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Insights into the physical and psychological effects of space travel on astronauts","title":"Homo Spatius","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
