The incredibly diverse lifestyles that are lived in our society suggest that the concept of normality is something that no longer has a place in people's minds. Nevertheless, the concept of \"normality\" significantly influences the lives of people - based only on different themes, actions, objects and subjects. This is not limited to conservative lifestyles. It is not the task of this film to criticize conventional forms of life, but to question the concept of convention in the unconventional. \"Normal\" means something quite different for very different people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"wOrlD","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
