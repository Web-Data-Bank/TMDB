Where a crowd of the most heartfelt and surefire characters together this summer creates an \"up-the-walls\" lively evening at Vallarna's classic outdoor scene. One can say that one of Gideon Wahlberg's famous works is resurrected and given new life. You are offered love, gap laughs, pilsner and brush strokes (yes) and a lot of singing when Sweden's laughter-most gang takes place on stage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wpaYMFYTske9MfmL6V5RO7RkA41.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2018-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pilsner Och Penseldrag","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
