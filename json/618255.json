Zina was separated from her two-month-old child and Djo finds out she's pregnant and plunges into mutism and expresses her Syrian horror only in the novel she is writing. Tunisian lawyer, Nadia and Dora, a humanitarian doctor, assist them in their hard and lengthy reconstruction; impeded by the violence of their close circles, the harsh view on the social networks and their angst.  Nadia, also Driss' lawyer, a 21-year-old persecuted homosexual who's been banned from all school establishments, asks him to help Zina in the hopes that their stirring meeting will allow them to open their black boxes, to assume themselves and stand up to the unjust society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bTgPuSzeVODlAMmXkR1LerwdrUO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":790,"logo_path":"/k0MnHFovKIeev0ANR0Ww6HO6tfF.png","name":"Samsa Film","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"2019-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scarecrows","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
