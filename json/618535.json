The days that pass in a terrible and fascinating wait.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4vFC9EGzzdsvcZP8kITkrorVs8W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ORA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
