Using the code-name “April 23,” Carl successfully infiltrates the uptown-downtown literary world in 1950s New York. He edits a magazine, follows the Knicks, and marries Melinda, the socialite wife of best-selling jock novelist Hubert Cleaver, Ayden’s hilarious Norman Mailer pastiche. Through Carl’s eyes, we see New York City change from an outpost of Europe to the new capital of an anarchistic, post-ideological world. But then, when Carl least expects it, he’s called.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cDYrDle1IDicJcNTK5C7TEQiSLG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sadness at Leaving","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
