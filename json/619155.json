After sharing a short story about how he met Guy Clark while hitchhiking around Texas, the band performed the ode to the Hill Country honky-tonkin’ queen “Rita Ballou,” featuring Eleanor Whitmore on violin. Following a tale about Clark’s loyalty to Texas BBQ over Tennessee style BBQ, Joe Ely joined Earle on stage to perform “Desperadoes Waiting For a Train” – two Texas music legends trading verses on one of the state’s most influential songs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/roqw3DPcA2pw9X1e7SMgofWKnRX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36238,"logo_path":null,"name":"KLRU Austin","origin_country":""},{"id":94654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Austin City Limits","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ode to Guy Clark: Steve Earle in Austin, TX","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
