Director Marilene Ribeiro surveys three hydro schemes that happen at different times in Brazil (past - the Sobradinho dam, present - the Belo Monte dam, and future - the Garambi-Panambi dam complex). The video engages with situations in which the impacts caused by dams emerge in a more sensitive way; for example, when participants of her project (individuals who have been affected by these ventures) draw, sing, or speak about their feelings and their interpretations of their lived experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Costs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
