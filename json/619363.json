The work combines miscellaneous forms of theatre genres such as drama and comedy and also reveals the act of creating artistic situations. Two men act out these questions in a choreographed performance in which a pair of shoes and socks, a false moustache and a broken chair are the props for their games. A latent homo-erotic tension and a subtle power struggle provide the narrative base. Nashat, always interested in the dynamics of the body, builds up an outrageous tension, which is unpredictably dissolved by a physical incident reminding of a very popular slapstick element.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2VZXMzAM0AR6cF3m9K41LutJVTr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Body Comedy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
