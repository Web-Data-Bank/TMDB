In Florence, three thirty-somethings band together to wage their own war on the system. Each of them is a person of talent who has been pushed out by \"favorites\" or raccomandati, people who have muscled in on the promotions they ought to have gotten by pulling strings.","popularity":5.045,"poster_path":"/etdWDLTRKshgdUBCivHOvMudxeV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10102,"logo_path":"/b0g4aEM39p0PwbIiaU1Cg3ZZUAq.png","name":"Cattleya","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Say No","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":110}
