Without human presence, the land is roamed by wildlife like civets, macaques and wild boars. A project is underway to study the deserted areas by attaching a camera to wild boars to record the conditions of the former farmlands. Years after the disaster, we take a close look at how radiation has affected the wildlife, and what it entails for us humans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/PDgcximyjys2OXkYymKRkjQH95.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radioactive Forest","video":true,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
