The figure of the tiger itself is the medium through which mythological, colonial and modern histories are evoked and folded into the present, highlighting unstable identities and shifting ground, as well as structural continuities and modernization ideologies. Modernity is reflected as a colonial pattern inscribed in the history of nation states, militarization and financialization, but also as a an ontological revolution, as an order that fundamentally upsets social organization, cultural patterns and indeed cosmologies, and that in most societies in the past 200 years has led to a profound crisis of consciousness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 or 3 Tigers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
