The couple is celebrating their anniversary. What Carl doesn't notice is that the wife has mouthed the words \"your dick\" to him, and then sexily picks up a long-shaped appetizer and licks the tip suggestively. As she goes towards the bathroom, Vanessa signals for the waiter to follow her. They fuck hard and rough, a raw, frenzied bathroom quickie. Vanessa can't get enough of Brayden's cock and isn't concerned about her husband catching them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3yJi7aBcpQ3jBsQnEJhcFiLtDSf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Luckiest Guy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
