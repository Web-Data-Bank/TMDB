Taking as its inspiration the (most likely apocryphal) story that actress Jeanne Moreau and her costar were \"really making love\" on the set of The Lovers, Cantor shows us what director Malle could not, through the addition of hardcore footage from the iconic Marilyn Chambers porn film. At times the edits between one film and the next are remarkably seamless, creating an ingenious illusion, at others Cantor self-consciously foregrounds her redubbing and re-editing of her VHS source material.\" - Electronic Arts Intermix","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j1sXCLE2xcm0qiJhUzKousGX7G8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madame Bovary's Revenge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
