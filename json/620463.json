Returning to the scene of filming, this film goes in search of the poetic force that flows from end to end in Lamorisse's film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1m2jsKX6boHJEkd26D9zLZyTE4M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shellac Sud","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":73467,"logo_path":"/2ShpO35d9Sja9UzdEzDtBk7DaQf.png","name":"Andolfi","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Alain Emery: The Child Who Did Not Know How to Smile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
