We've compiled six color films from the archives of the prolific physique photographer that exemplify his taste for manly men. When Mizer was king, all you needed was a ten-gallon-hat, a toy gun, and a throbbing member. They just don't make ‘em like they used to – but we do. During the tumultuous time between the 60s and 70s, a small, but brave, few gave birth to the fantasies of many in movie houses across the US. These films have not been seen since they debuted in adult movie houses some 40 years ago.","popularity":1.379,"poster_path":"/pMoyUFaTclWVqjw4m8WhDhQjIde.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bob Mizer Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":115973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Athletic Model Guild","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theatre Film Classics: Teacher's Pests","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
