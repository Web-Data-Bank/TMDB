In the period between the end of World War II and the 1960s, the play was adapted in Hong Kong cinema a total of six times. Director Huang Yu alone adapted it twice, as a Republic era story and a period comedy, respectively. The 1955 Republic era-set film is more faithful to its source material, following a spoiled rich brat who is mistaken as a government inspector in a small town and ends up being wined and dined by a corrupted local official. The film pokes fun at the ugliness of bureaucracy in old society, calling back to renowned Qing Dynasty novel Officialdom Unmasked while keeping the original play's artistic style.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Great Wall Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1955-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nikolai Gogol's The Inspector General 1955 adaptation","title":"The Inspector General","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
