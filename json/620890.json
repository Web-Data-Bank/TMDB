He is then interrupted himself by an actor dressed as a caveman. When the writer takes the 'doctor' aside, the reporter then bumps into someone looking for the designer, before heading over to \"Verity Lamberth\" and \"Sydney Newbaum\", who explains there will be no \"bug-eyed monsters\" in the show, as someone wheels a Dalek between them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qvCYOWoOpR3kJyITz1gwFbnENBJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Corridor Sketch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
