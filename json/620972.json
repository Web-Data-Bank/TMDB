The film was banned in France and Algeria but won the Grand Prize at the Leipzig International Film Festival in 1965. Out of friendship, the production company Images de France sent an operator, Bruno Muel, who later declared: \"For those who were called to Algeria (for me, 1956-58), participating in a film on independence was a victory over horror, lies and absurdity. It was also the beginning of my commitment to the cinema.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cFUGQ2pG8yWwhp0B8AD2eWC3mjg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Capi Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Argos Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":169048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tamasa Distribution","origin_country":""},{"id":20116,"logo_path":"/qWEOTzHiZNWnyp1b3PYB1X63vfy.png","name":"Cinémathèque Française","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1965-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Algeria, Year Zero","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
