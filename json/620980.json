The camera pans along frozen squares and zooms into details of the immediate surroundings - innocently reinventing tropes from video-art of the preceding two decades: the unit of “what happens” not an event, but an experience, as it falls oblivion together with the anonymous dreaming collective to which it occurred.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phenomenon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
