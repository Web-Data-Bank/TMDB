What if her father had been an alien who left Earth to return to his own planet? In that case, Aurelie would be an alien too. That would explain many things such as why she feels different from others, especially her mother, why she can't string two words together without making a mistake, and why boys really get on her nerves. Through the pages of her diary, Aurelie confides her joys and sorrows, successes and failures, love and friendships, and tries to find her place.","popularity":1.555,"poster_path":"/nZqhjC0iUwYlRkOoIFlmmRaYD3i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13312,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Vision 4","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le journal d'Aurélie Laflamme","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":11}
