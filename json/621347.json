In this context of expropriation, Gedalia feels free to build his home and to try to fulfil his dream: a simple life, in harmony with God, outside the laws and duties of society. Life is but a dream is the story of the daily life of a settler's family, between contradictions, radical choices, difficulties, needs, and possible fears.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/scasM0UlgIb4VBacEVhbGxPmrhb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2018-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Is But a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
