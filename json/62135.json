Amidst the quaint Parisian street night, Fifi Koko runs a petty short order diner. Although her name is famous in chef circles she has placed her uncanny culinary skills on the back burner as she falls prey to an existential quagmire that fears her talent shall not overcome the expectations her reputation has sown. The late hours play out as Fifi must face her talent and unrequited love for a friend, while a collective stream of colorful creatures of the night make through Fifi's consciousness to feed her with temptation, insight, and humor on the path of her life-defining decision.","popularity":1.137,"poster_path":"/aGVyOVOj1OBKowB9cN88aw2fefN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life is a buffet","title":"Short Order","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":7}
