She gives the baby a spindle, saying that one day the Princess will prick her finger on it and die. The Lilac Fairy makes her own christening gift a softening of Carabosse’s curse: Aurora will not die, but will fall into a deep sleep, which only a prince’s kiss will break. The masterful 19th-century choreography of Marius Petipa is combined with sections created for The Royal Ballet by Frederick Ashton, Anthony Dowell and Christopher Wheeldon. Recorded live as part of the Royal Opera House Live Cinema Season 2019/20 with encore screenings broadcast online during the #OurHousetoYourHouse programme.","popularity":1.633,"poster_path":"/i9pmhteFuiESvVhavOFH4Sx71IF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sleeping Beauty (Royal Ballet)","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
