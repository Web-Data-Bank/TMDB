With his blond hair, toned body, and charming smile, it's no surprise that he's become quite popular. He's only been on his mission a short while, but he's already earned a reputation for being a bit of a mischief-maker. Having been through his initiation and calling, Elder Holland is well on his way to being ordained into the higher priesthood of the Order. The powerful men controlling his fate know he must learn obedience and submission and are happy to put him through all the necessary lessons. As he continues on his journey, Elder Holland must also reconcile with his companion, Elder Oaks, about his previous aggressive behavior. His atonement for his actions seems to continue on and on, but in the end, the young man knows it`s worth it.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/svIJKDQuo0gGaEAWJyqsm8GZnHb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Missionary Boyz","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elder Holland: Chapters 7-11","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
