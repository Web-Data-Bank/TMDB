This is its second revival since Jones’ production hit the stage in autumn 2017, replacing John Copley’s beloved 40-year old staging, resplendent with period detail and resolutely naturalist. Jones brings a considerable break with the past in his approach, pointing the way towards thought-provoking possibilities for the work, though it is a clearly a show that defers to the need for regular revival and breadth of appeal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/173rByXwzXJSotvobaGvq3KcQOF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"La bohème  at the Royal Opera House 2019/20","title":"Puccini: La bohème","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
