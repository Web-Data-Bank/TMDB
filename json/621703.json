Eric spends the nights crammed into a brick shelter with his dad, sister and her screaming kids, and every bombardment brings tears over the loss of his mother in an earlier raid. When he learns his sweetheart is to be evacuated, he finally buckles under the stress.","popularity":0.881,"poster_path":"/iJwZtN7nWzxir2z5wM0ypyZifZE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alan Parker Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Hard Feelings","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
