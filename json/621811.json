Leafing through postcards, book pages, and her own photographs as she talks, Davey reflects on varied approaches to photography and film, such as planned versus unscripted recording of reality and the passage from private to public realms with a camera. Davey punctuates her narration with thoughts on writing as she simultaneously listens to and recites a script based on her 2011 essay, “The Wet and the Dry.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mEuSd31R3ksTXQNX6e0I1jw3b1V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Goddesses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
