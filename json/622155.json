Although Roger Waters declined to grant an interview in this programme, the post-Waters era is only briefly mentioned (during the last 2 minutes). The rest is focused on the band's history with Waters. The documentary not only features interviews with all three members of Pink Floyd at the time, but also includes interesting interviews with several people closely related to the band: Andrew King, Joe Boyd, Mike Leonard, Storm Thorgerson, Ron Geesin, Clare Torry , Douglas Adams, and others. It also contains rare archive footage, such as extracts from 1968's \"Tomorrow's World\" programme and a very original film showing the band recording for the song \"Marooned\" in David Gilmour's studio-boat, the Astoria, with Bob Ezrin playing bass in this session.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eMZwdbpDu5JGsx8mKHMNG23Q8wk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Floyd: The Story","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
