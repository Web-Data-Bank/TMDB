It has a 17 part quasi-musical structure inspired by Dmitri Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues that at times ignores the literal meaning of certain interviews for the fragrant affect of the language and body language; that is, certain interactions are left un-translated so that the viewer is given full and unfettered access to the musical spirit that animates the arguments and quarrels caught so delicately in the sound and images. - Daniel Barnett","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aiHFEnEcQ9MFpuvvj8d8tvS5pWN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Anagram","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
