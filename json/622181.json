Setting off on their pilgrimage for a very humble destination, they travel along narrow country roads, and converse while listening to each other. The first one, Mili Pecherer, the director, carries on her back a both grotesque and enigmatic burden: a huge hemorrhoid-shaped bundle. As far as the second one is concerned, she is expecting a child. Understandably, here a serious and a comical approach are combined for this wandering on the foothills of the Pyrenees, open to carnival and irreverent tones under the auspices of a medieval song. As the picaresque tradition has it, this trip will give rise to meetings: with a farmer and father hosting them, with the inventor of a machine designed to find lost cats. And also a donkey, the transient travelling companion of this fanciful voyage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nbj1uMiC3iSICdevC4gGcpKFlXq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Glorious It Is to Be a Human Being","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
