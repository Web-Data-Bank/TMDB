Bennani's mother, a real-life pharmacist and pathologist, also plays one here on the CAPS. Her own mother's 80th birthday is the occasion for the titular party, at which she will debut a youthful new look, the product of an extensive rejuvenation procedure ...

We spend time with the party’s MC-for-hire as he slurps harira, flips off a trooper, and dispenses a longish musical interlude about a food vendor who once invoked his ire. Eventually, we land on the nightmarish, static-riven eyes and mouth of ZIP, a user interface promising an illicit escape from the CAPS, suggesting we \"sign the lease\" on a new body in Florida.\" — Maxwell Paparella (Screen Slate)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xQ3h9sftissJEedsJnsV1exvh1u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Party on the CAPS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
