A travelling theater troupe, led by Umagoro Ichikawa, comes to play in a mining town, and manages to sell every seat. Before the play begins, however, a miners' strike is announced, creating an uproar. In addition, the players find they have been cheated out of their profits by a crooked impresario. The socially naive actors join together with the progressive union members to create a political 'strike drama,' and learn much from each other in the process.\" --Alan Poul, Japan Society","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4URwCW5VJPwyw6DtME9hFHCAP55.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yamamoto Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1955-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Floating Weeds Diary","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
