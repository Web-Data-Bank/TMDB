Unbeknownst to most of their white passengers, porters played critical political and cultural roles, becoming trailblazers in the struggle for African American dignity and self-sufficiency, patriarchs of black labor unions, and helping give birth to the Civil Rights Movement. Ultimately, however, their greatest legacy is that which they left to future generations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dRbbEx6oqzriS8PNQitlVfiVHH9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They Rose from the Rails","title":"Rising from the Rails: The Story of the Pullman Porter","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
