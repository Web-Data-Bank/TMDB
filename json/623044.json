What emerges is a potent and inspiring story of Jewish pluralism and a community navigating the cross-currents of Jewish tradition and social change. Beyond the struggle to create a supportive environment for gay and lesbian students and teachers at the school, this is the story of a community wrestling with the very definition of pluralism and diversity in a Jewish context.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wEWoDqwlSYqimzYIsi6kJDQx5kP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hineini: Coming Out in a Jewish High School","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
