That's what Donaghy told the FBI, that's what he told 60 Minutes, and that's what he testified in court. But that's not what really happened. That's not even close. INSIDE GAME is the untold true story of one of the biggest scandals in sports history.","popularity":1.774,"poster_path":"/vEVFQYliFNvMOG0Y3telnveXKuV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of the NBA betting scandal","title":"Inside Game","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6}
