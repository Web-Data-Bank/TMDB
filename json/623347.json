In certain passages of the video, the combination of circles and ellipses resembles an eye, returning the gaze of the spectator. In the middle of the piece there are rows that incorporate nine contrasting sequences comprising six different colours and tones in alternating combinations. Besides the physical impact of this piece, I am primarily interested in the relation between the edges of planes/shapes and the confines of the screen. Whatâ€™s fascinating to me is the way in which the colour fields are reproduced by the eye and brain, affecting consciousness and perception.  - Simon Payne","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c205ES8gBt6IntU2JTauDNeeupr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iris Out","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
