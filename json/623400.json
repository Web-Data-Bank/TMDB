These conditions prevented my carrying anything heavy and gave me ophthalmic migraines. Under pressure, I started to draw. Later, when I rediscovered these drawings, I decided to make a film all by myself, with no crew and as little gear as possible in order not to overburden my back. I spent five years harvesting images, assembling, erasing and ordering them to tell this tale of one little woman and soulmates: a tale that has become my way of handling the spokes in my wheel. Over the years, I have learnt to reach out and share my experiences with humour.” Zoé Chantre","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2mAVqP0adS5Scts3Nhp0YVucCFp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiens-moi droite","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
