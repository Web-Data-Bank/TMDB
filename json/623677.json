Bissette, creator of DC Comic Book character \"The Swamp Thing\" and co-creator of the comic character \"Constantine\" teaches film appreciation and the art of comic book illustration in rural Vermont. Bissette is a life-long fan of DANGER: DIABOLIK and in \"From Fumetti to Film,\" Bissette gives us a guided tour of how, in his own words, DANGER: DIABOLIK was \"...the best adaptation of comic book to feature film bar none.\" His concepts of how the apparent 2-dimensional world of comic book illustrations were faithfully, but imaginatively re-interpreted by director Mario Bava are enhanced with side by side comparisons of the original comic book images laid next to film clips. Other films and television adaptations of comic books in that era were less successful, according to Bissette.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":25669,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZAP Zoetrope Aubry Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Danger: Diabolik - From Fumetti to Film","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
