The climatic factor is depicted as a visual metaphor of the society and the internal self of individuals. The dryness in the male character and the desolate landscape critiques the patriarchal system of that time.\r \"Un Matoneado\" tells the story of Gabriel’s revenge. His hate and wish of death turns into a big mistake. It is an example of the sociocultural context of the countryside people, and once again the patriarchal point of view of how one´s supposed to deal with problems \"as a man\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7R94zPNy3L5TqhIxD5ScROjNvtP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibú Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"}],"release_date":"2015-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unos cuentos de Angustias y Paisajes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
