One hundred years later, Kerry Laitala pays tribute to this historical moment with a dual-projector performance involving archival images of silhouetted spectators of the 1939 New York Worldâ€™s Fair sharing screen space with sinuous light shapes swirling, twinkling and bouncing across the frame like unbound forces of energy. The City Luminous: Spectacle of Light will be accompanied by a live soundtrack by Voicehandler (Jacob Felix Heule and Danishta Rivero), who manipulate sounds from various sources including a mechanical music box from Switzerland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hlIuphBB4WV44GLz15BJLP7Lplp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The City Luminous: Spectacle of Light","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
