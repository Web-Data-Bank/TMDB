Habakari chose ten filmmakers to make a five-minute work each, developed around a gay or lesbian theme, and compiled the resulting shorts in random order to create this omnibus film. The result is a queer film, by queer filmmakers, for a queer audience. Each short is its own short story, and the styles range from drama and experimental film and animation.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/X5O9nrllY9Mv3UrPyaREu5MJrJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queer Boys and Girls on the Shinkansen","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
