Using the resources at the tail end of a comet, massive spaceships will be sent to the corners of the universe in an attempt to colonize other worlds, but due to the length of time it will take to arrive at even the closest solar system, the comets must be destroyed in-flight, resulting in super-fast speeds that will kill any life onboard; only frozen sperm and eggs, and machines will survive the journey.  Carrying the unborn children of the Robinsons, the first of these ships must now set forth to Ozma; and with its precious cargo is coupled the hopes and fears of all humanity.","popularity":0.939,"poster_path":"/iAR5HppIge2gI4xT7XmiBsQZzpW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5805,"logo_path":"/jiTDwr7CelkRTSJt8or6WipN75c.png","name":"Studio Aoi","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3069,"logo_path":"/tpGaXEBassYaiEBvnJ7K5vchT50.png","name":"Tokyo Movie Shinsha","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1987-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Space Fantasia 2001 Nights","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
