From humble beginnings to Downing Street soirées, from dodging bailiffs to releasing multi-platinum albums, Creation had it all. Breakdowns, bankruptcy, fights and friendships… and not forgetting the music. Featuring some of the greatest records you have ever heard, we follow Alan through a drug-fuelled haze of music and mayhem, as his rock’n’roll dream brings the world Oasis, Primal Scream, and other generation-defining bands.","popularity":6.849,"poster_path":"/2qjWOHYUjJhw5qe86Qk790vaegf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burning Wheel Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":5056,"logo_path":"/kADFcjL04xe5HGBnlLjbfhliS2a.png","name":"Head Gear Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":25954,"logo_path":"/oga9DS7GZGbZ0iZ4JFuVTBMBv1C.png","name":"Metrol Technology","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":171436,"logo_path":"/2PCuIrmhOMX9eGpxs8PQWjxfU3s.png","name":"Carte Blanche","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creation Stories","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":17}
