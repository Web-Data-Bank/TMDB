As a film editor, I was mainly curious to know about his editing technique. When I tried to get an interview, Jonas played his accordion, his tuba, his harmonica… He even organized a jam session in the basement of AFA. I wondered: ‘Is Jonas too shy to let himself be interviewed by a woman?’ Enlisting a cameraman to shoot the film instead of me did the trick. Jonas invited us to his loft on Broadway and to his editing room. How happy I was to be watching as he gave me a long master class.” –Jackie Raynal","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nJcIgmq02PdZDA4Wr10lwZMkMRs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is Jonas too shy to let himself be interviewed by a woman?","title":"Notes on Jonas Mekas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
