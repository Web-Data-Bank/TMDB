Accompanied by his equally adventurous wife Nicole, who drove a motorcycle with their supplies and pup tent in tow, they planned and executed the journey of a lifetime. Leaving from Sion, Switzerland in 2000, they returned five years later having traversed six continents and thirty-five countries. Alone in the world's most unforgiving landscapes they confronted challenges that threatened to push them beyond their physical and emotional limits - extreme weather, civil unrest, deadly disease, horrific poverty and a variety of other life-threatening events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zjEa58K4wGqCdlDfD6uPQfW2aqK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 25,000 Mile Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
