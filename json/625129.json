Photographer David Maisel captured these beautifully unique urns of forgotten souls on film. Exhibiting their photos revealed secrets, influenced political decisions and reunited families. This film will show how art can stimulate social change and will document the ongoing controversy surrounding a proper memorial for these institutionalized casualties.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gWGP7HzfEPmzxPU5gSv5G3Ww477.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Library of Dust","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
