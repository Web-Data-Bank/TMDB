While Zenobia (Nicole Ari Parker) is still looking for a man, Victoria (Tamala Jones) is married to a man who doesn't want children. Clevon (Kevin Hart), meanwhile, is too geeky to get a woman, and Phil (Keith Robinson) is already married with children, but his wife is not very interested in being a mother. All four of them try to rectify their romantic lives and futures while their biological clocks tick away.","popularity":4.933,"poster_path":"/btW3UGhWOd3TnLseOI76EPjPQXB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6728,"logo_path":"/2HMc1LNp5BoVSJtM2vHh5UuLXfw.png","name":"Swirl Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":80431,"logo_path":null,"name":"UpToParr Productions LLC","origin_country":""},{"id":3086,"logo_path":"/iksa7hXQMvPIzfSq0Tuo4WPU8gc.png","name":"Image Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"35 and Ticking","video":false,"vote_average":5.591,"vote_count":22}
