His good looks and playful spirit get him a lot of attention, but he's never quite figured out what to do with it. As he's gotten older, his body has become an object of desire, but the repressed missionary hardly ever thinks of himself in that way. However, the men of the Order are infatuated with his friendly and bright smile. They want to see him realize his full potential and see what a catch he is. They've seen him checking out the other men and think they know how to seduce him into the ranks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xkLaVdK16SsN37wwyqsMA8rNoea.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Missionary Boyz","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elder Calder: Chapters 1-6","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
