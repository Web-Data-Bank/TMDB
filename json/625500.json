An arrival in the cinematic tradition of 1920s avantgarde, with the railway and industrial modernity as a favourite graphical motif, which takes him past a fish market and a strange procession, and finally home to a small family, where the grandparents drink tea, smoke cigarettes and chat cheerfully. The image of a young woman burns itself onto the celluloid - and into the filmmaker's consciousness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83012,"logo_path":null,"name":"If You Hold a Stone","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Winter of Zeljka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
