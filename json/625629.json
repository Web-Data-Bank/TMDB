Headwinds arise as critics get offended by the claims that Eryn is being declared a living literary legend. The storm gathers force as the assaults gravitate from bad reviews to a fake-memoir designed to obliterate her from the field. Through the noise, Eryn attempts to write her way out of the public fray, and reclaim her voice in the minds of her readers. Along the way, she hopes to prove a happy ending is not always a bad thing.","popularity":1.684,"poster_path":"/tpwsbzvSVgzXkxcOC1HLDhOOj4Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Creatress","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":7}
