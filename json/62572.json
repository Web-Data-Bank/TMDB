The two sicilian directors use a language free from compromise and from the traditional storyline rules: the movie is photographed in a sharp and very contrasting black & white, with no beautiful pimp music, and lacks a logical story. There are no women (the ones we see are actually men), and the language is strict sicilian dialect. The directing style is characterized by long fixed shots on a post-atomic world, which is really present-day Palermo, inhabited by fat people in socks and underwear who burp and fart while roaming around smelly alleyways and waste dumps.","popularity":1.484,"poster_path":"/4rTDFNEr2pSUTYulzv2zc19ystW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Digital Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1995-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Uncle from Brooklyn","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":20}
