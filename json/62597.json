The odyssey is a homecoming for singer Chhom Nimol and a transformation for the rest of the band as they perform with master musicians and record new songs along the way. More than a rockumentary, the film serves up a portrait of modern Cambodia as the band tours through Phnom Penh and beyond, crossing a great cultural chasm with the same spirit of Cambodia's original rock pioneers.","popularity":1.551,"poster_path":"/7KrqDTlbLRFnvytDxE455lmINS9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleepwalking Through The Mekong","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
