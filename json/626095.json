Vans’ The Tony Alva Story chronicles T.A.’s humble beginnings on the streets of Santa Monica to his rise to superstardom as part of the legendary Z-Boys, his inevitable drug-induced implosion and his ultimate rise from the ashes to accept his rightful place as a beacon of hope and inspiration for generations of skateboarders the world over.","popularity":0.712,"poster_path":"/dUxZk4O4DiMwmSDHnDuhZl6IZUA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Six Stair Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tony Alva Story","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
