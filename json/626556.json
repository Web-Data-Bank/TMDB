In the film, all types of images flash quickly on screen. Images include fried eggs, Marlboro cigarette packages, and the American flag. The film continues flashing images in a quick, rhythmic pace and only slows down at three points in the film. The first slow sequence, is in a junkyard where an automobile is being set down by a tow truck. The second sequence is of two females in the nude, chatting, smoking, and eating saltines. The final slow sequence is of a man who appears to stick his tongue out, but as his \"tongue\" is pulled out further, it becomes apparent it's some sort of pink substanceâ€”not his tongue. In this film and in Festival of the Cyclists, Byron re-uses some of the same film scenes to create original content.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hexagrams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
