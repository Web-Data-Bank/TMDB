Working as a trumpeter, teacher, club singer and club act agent, his son, 40 year old ex-miner Joe can just about scrape a living, but his marriage is breaking up. 10 year old Michael is left to grapple with his own realities as coalfield culture begins to disintegrate. Three generations struggle to come to terms with the past and find the ties that still bind them; three worlds unfold against the rich and extraordinary backdrop of East Durham.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rRhw0yoLdiGdhpHjEnGS52p2cVl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38052,"logo_path":"/8uZNsz3zVarlswxx3CDBtfLPgMT.png","name":"Amber Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like Father","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
