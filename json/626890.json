But was this stirring tale of violence and revenge simply an allegory, or were there real giants of the deep deliberately attacking whaling ships? With the help of centuries old witness accounts and modern day science, we explain how the legend of the great white whale came to be. Then we determine if the multiple sperm whale assaults on ships in the 19th century were indeed premeditated and coordinated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hLT2A2Cgjj6ZYR7DZfFhxmfggiy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moby Dick: Heart Of A Whale","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
