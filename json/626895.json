The project was initiated by the artist asking people what they could remember about an old film called 'Whistle Down The Wind' starring Hayley Mills in 1961, which was filmed around Pendle Hill and involved many local school children.  This film follows over 60 members of the local community as they remember old scenes and imagine new ones while revealing the ‘majestic’ presence and power of Pendle Hill and the surrounding countryside and revealing contemporary social issues in the process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"[birdsong]","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
