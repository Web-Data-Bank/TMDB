My dad has spent thirty years alone at sea fishing lobster. He was taught the trade by his dad, who learnt from his dad. A heritage pasted down from father to son. My father never got a son, only daughters and since I was a girl no one assumed I was interested. After I turned eighteen I left Sweden and moved to Australia. After a decade abroad I started to long for home. I return to the island to see if I have it in me, can I learn the things I was never taught as a child? Will the legacy fade with me or can I become the family's next lobster fisherman? /Karolin Axelsson","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u50XkW0u5m31V0Ff47KdJhlqxww.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67256,"logo_path":"/nU1s0hj1y1Hhxy8I0fXic0Up3Od.png","name":"Mediabruket","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2018-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a documentary about heritage, knots and open oceans","title":"The Last in a Line of Fishermen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
