The result, however, would be something that looked and sounded a lot like Kenn Kington. Great comedy without any side effects (no blushing, no cringing, no embarrassing situations), just a bunch of life in its funniest form. If you are looking for a different perspective on life or just need a good hour of laughter, this performance is for you. You will see firsthand why Kenn says, \"I Don't Understand,\" and why love really is funny and life can be very weird. Enjoy! Answers to Questions I Don't Have Do I Look Fat?
