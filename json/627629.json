Shot over a 6-month period by the owners, Wendy and Ler, this intimate documentary is an unfettered access into the lives of the flmmakers, exposing their deepest vulnerabilities in face of this crisis, which had crushed their fnances and strained their relationship.  Through their personal story, Wendy and Ler hope to create more awareness for dogs with cancer in Singapore and around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uDNrdjQhaRfZilyAEOwEHTURETL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2019-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vios","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
