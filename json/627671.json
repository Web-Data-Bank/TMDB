Narrations by various contemporary witnesses, interviews with a historian and former Zoras bring the history of the Rote Zora and the women’s movement of the time back to life. The film shows that many of the Rote Zora’s themes are highly topical and offers exciting material for discussion on how to deal with this history today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iNzHwkmLJG7ZT4skFoAm4DI3qHX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122547,"logo_path":null,"name":"FrauenLesbenFilmCollectif Las Otras","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frauen bildet Banden","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
