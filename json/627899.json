Normality 1-10, a series of short video essays, registers everyday neo-fascist violence as being  an instrument of such \"normalization.\" In a matter-of-fact and at the same time insistent manner, Hito Steyerl offers a richly detailed report on the growing number of anti-Semitic and racist attacks - on cemeteries, monuments and human beings - in both Austria and Germany.
