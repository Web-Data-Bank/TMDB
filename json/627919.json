In 1978, Nobel Science Prize winners Pjotr Kapitsa, Arno Penzias, Hamilton O. Smith, Peter D. Mitchell and Werner Arber were filmed in a Stockholm TV studio talking with Bengt Feldreich about fossil fuels, nuclear reactors, genetics, the nature of time and symmetry. My version is a flicker film comprised solely of the Finnish subtitles that were played during the original broadcast. The film runs in a rapid loop, emulating the effect of a Tibetan prayer wheel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2011-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man and Science","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
