The film is divided into two parts. Part 1 is about the conflicts of married female office workers who suffer from undertaking office work, housework, and childcare all at the same time. Part 2 focuses on single female workers who break away from being the traditional ‘flower of the company,’ and develop a greater sense of autonomy as they actively participate in forming a labor union.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Even Little Grass Has Its Own Name","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
