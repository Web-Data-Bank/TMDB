Pia was 14 years old when she started smoking cannabis and using drugs. Then it all happened really fast. The heavier drugs, the men who beat, and years of cold nights in basements and attics. Treatment and punishment. Rehabs and prisons. Relapse. Constantly back, at the complete bottom, among shame and guilt. For ten years, Tom Alandh and photographer Björn Henriksson documented Pia's life. Two films were made, this is the third and last film, which shows how she managed to get clean against all odds.","popularity":0.933,"poster_path":"/uiDpFMKa1DQ2uKDOQwtfNS7R3g5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":88241,"logo_path":null,"name":"SVT Dokumentär","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leva Livet","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":3}
