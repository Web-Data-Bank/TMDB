Narcissistic, spot-on selfie media satire ‘Follow’, starring accomplished little kids who want to be stars, looks and tastes like a bowl of rainbow candy. But they are laced with something sharp. Perhaps even a razor blade, embedded in the chocolate bar of urban Hallowe’en legend.  This is no Thai ‘Bugsy Malone’. These are not kids in Big People drag. They are themselves. One wishes in fact that they were not so natural; that the film weren’t so realistic. “Evie, why don’t you do your homework?” – “I’m busy with my business,” says the worldly little girl. What business? “The movie star business of course,” is her barely exasperated reply. In Thai, or rather Tinglish, that’s “Turakij Movie Star”, and I’m so sorry if you can’t speak Thai, because they can’t afford English subtitles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/70eSvR2V1YNZ5MBXUYOwviXegQK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122601,"logo_path":null,"name":"dude","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2019-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Up Close with Your Idol","title":"Follow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
