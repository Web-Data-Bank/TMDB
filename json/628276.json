Led by the enigmatic and charismatic Desiree, The Sisterhood delivers to Ashley everything it promises. She gets a raise at her job, her divorce is resolved in her favor and she finally feels fulfilled and happy. But she soon discovers that the benefits of The Sisterhood come at a steep, and sometimes illegal price.
