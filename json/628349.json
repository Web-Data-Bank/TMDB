An actress undertakes her desire of directing her first movie, without a budget or any production company funding her project. She gathers a group of  professional actors and actresses, and proposes a project based on a very particular experience: stepping on their fears through a metaphorical 'leap of faith'. As the project advances, individual  conflicts will arise affecting the shoot, making the movie crew wonder whether or not they should go on. Will they take the leap of faith with all its consequences?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/63G0hyZcBhEEe8Z0GJws2hKT95K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puenting (Leap of Faith)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
