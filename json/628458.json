Τσάκωνας","overview":"In this offering, Kostas Tsakonas (a champion of the SOV comedy of the era) as a wimpy poor guy & petty thief who lives with his nephew, is chosen by the arch-Dracula to rule Greece, since he's a long lost relative of the vampire family, and since the current Prime Minister has sucked the Greeks dry (yes, there's some awful not-so-subtle dated attempts at political satire in there as well). What follows is Tsakona's transformation and consequent attempts to adjust to his new vampiric lifestyle, while a clumsy exorcist and some of his fellow villagers are after him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9xt6fIkrRuVaJqZRNSeFDBrqFUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cas Cine Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1989-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Count Tsakona and His Draculettes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
