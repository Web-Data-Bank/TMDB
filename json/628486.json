The global scientific community has reached broad consensus on climate change  – but its social consequences, and how we will deal with them, highlight our failure of imagination.  HOME FRONT explores how climate change is inexorably linked to our national and regional security, and how the relationship between climate disruption and conflict will be the predominant force shaping the social, political, and economic world of the 21st century.","popularity":0.791,"poster_path":"/fKcwDZyX0wudzCoGlrOEfZBEIQV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Front - Facing Australia’s Climate Emergency","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
