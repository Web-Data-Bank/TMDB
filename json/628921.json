Halfway between the Second World War and The Civil Rights Movement, Phil and Stephanie Barber created an oasis in the Berkshire Hills in Western Massachusetts where aspiring musicians came to learn from the very best.  Students and faculty, young and old, rich and poor, white, black, and brown convened together and learned from each other.  Defying the surrounding environment, Music Inn harbored a racial and cultural harmony where music was all that mattered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f4cb5299WNF7nVBeOgCna9rQKjd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music Inn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
