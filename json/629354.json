Recently she has been feeling uncomfortable and lonely. Not so long ago she moved to Munich with her parents Frank and Ariane from another city. In her new home, the girl does not find a real connection with her new classmates. Fixed by the virtual reality game \"Avalonia\", gaming is gradually becoming the elixir of life. Jennifer neglects her school and family responsibilities. She ignores all admonitions, restrictions and prohibitions for every precious second of the game and betrays her parents. Only the secret, excessive immersion in the virtual fantasy world of \"Avalonia\" seems to make Jennifer happy. The Parents have to watch as their daughter's life gets completely out of balance between the real and the virtual world.","popularity":0.878,"poster_path":"/iVlTwTae3SLSmIgREmmsxW8FZkb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sappralot Productions","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":20276,"logo_path":"/o32RqN5s3TZKz4VCKBI1WCmMQxk.png","name":"Tellux Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":6187,"logo_path":"/gtC63XG8fkFxszIuZIogffM1oY8.png","name":"ARD Degeto","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Play","video":false,"vote_average":4.688,"vote_count":8}
