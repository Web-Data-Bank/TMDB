He served as a criminal judge for 45 years and issued about 4500 death sentences; a record in not only Iran, but also the world. This documentary looks into his personal and professional life as he is followed within his home with his family, in the court of law, and in his retirement days. The ultimate purpose of the documentary is to deduce the role of death in the judge's life as he either takes life away from criminals or death comes to his loved ones. During his retirement, he is once again given the choice between the life and death of a person, despite no longer being a judge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2JlDdUGyjopC7UmgH3teOl7bxuv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2018-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death and the Judge","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
