Director Jason Ruscio expresses the profound loneliness of a decimated world through richly textured images that bring to mind the films of Andrei Tarkovsky â€“ burned out interiors, hands grasping to hold each other, time-worn photographs and faceless soldiers in the snow. ECLIPSE is a remarkable meditation on the effects of war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eclipse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
