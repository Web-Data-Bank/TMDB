Once known as the High Street of America, much has changed on Route 66. The road itself has become outdated, while the nation it transects stands at a crossroads.  Shot from the hip, the film follows four cyclists as they ride the 4,000 kilometres from Chicago to Los Angeles and documents every moment of their adventure, the roads they ride and the people they meet.  Outskirts: Route 66 is the first in a series of films chronicling epic adventures along the worldâ€™s most famous roads.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bNqh0lKF3DXW7UakwrTSAOMKOUu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thereabouts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outskirts: Route 66","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
