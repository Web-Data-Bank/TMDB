Balked of a personal meeting with his divinity, the young man tries to convey a note to her, and drops it, as he imagines, in her shoe. Unluckily the note falls into the colonel's boot by mistake, and the latter is amazed by the sudden affection of his daughter, who tries to persuade him not to go out. He insists, and accompanied by the girl, ventures into the street.
