The rigorous Seizure Law provides banks and other institutions with an easier way of gaining real estate. When the system fails, when a citizen has nowhere to apply for assistance and when the unscrupulous administration dislodges them from their flats or houses, then young activists arrive to help and with their bodies prevent the execution of the eviction. HOME has recorded grievous scenes from the very places where the cordons of special police use force to drag away children, women, the young and the old - whose one and only wish is to stay and live in their only home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/alAvnu1tXeuB1OsO5Tb3Kt6NwrX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122814,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kadar Film \u0026 Video Production","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2017-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
