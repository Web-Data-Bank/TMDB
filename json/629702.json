Lending equal narrative weight to the experiences of the center’s groundbreaking surgeon Dr. Jess Ting and those of his diverse group of patients, BORN TO BE perfectly balances compassionate personal storytelling and fly-on-the-wall vérité. It’s a film of astonishing access—most importantly into the lives, joys, and fears of the people at its center.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zXqa8OAQ9q2zVRCqvatjgLL7hEI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143923,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transformation Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":143924,"logo_path":null,"name":"Justice-Partners","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you see yourself, who do you see?","title":"Born to Be","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
