A cinematographic encounter with people living among the traces of natural disasters, economic decline and a turbulent history. The Mississippi River flows both through the Deep South and the imagination of the American nation; it draws the border between the East and the West of the country, but also the division between the North and the South. As a blue meridian, it represents the complex relation between place and identity in North America. The film portrays people living in the decay of semi abandoned places, who try to rebuild, preserve and survive, in an attempt to take a stand in their land and its history. Flooding, civil rights movement riots, racism, real estate speculation have caused people to leave these towns and cities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Meridian","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
