Behind the scenes Darrell suffered from debilitating flashbacks, self injury, addiction and misdiagnosis, until the right doctor isolated the key to unlocking the memories his brain kept locked away for over 50 years. Cracked Up, director Michelle Esrick, creates an inspiring balance between comedy and tragedy helping us understand the impact of toxic stress and childhood trauma in a new light, breaking down barriers of stigma and replacing shame with compassion and hope.","popularity":1.933,"poster_path":"/5Chb0tcja5tOMS8zgQANeNTdgBP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95417,"logo_path":"/Q9YTXIe2ZGjWa1Ors6sqOpGrWp.png","name":"Abramorama","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cracked Up: The Darrell Hammond Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":10}
