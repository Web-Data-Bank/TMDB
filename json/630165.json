In his 2015 obituary the New York Times declared him “one of the most accomplished recorders of the American experience.” Howard Greenberg says Feinstein “ occupies high ground in the pantheon of street photography” yet, most people, have never heard of him.  A prodigious talent, Feinstein photographed life in all its forms, when and where he wished. Whether this was as a draftee in the Korean War, in a Bebop infused Manhattan loft or rural hippy enclave in upstate NY, Harold’s 35mm black and white photographs captured the essence of life with a with a uniquely humanist eye. The re-discovery of Feinstein’s vast and diverse body of work came in his final years and the film meets him then; in his early 80s and with a zen-like appreciation for the life he lived.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Shot New York","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
