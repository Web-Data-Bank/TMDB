I have long seen in them an agression by negligence. With patience, I found in them the solution that fancy lab prints could not convey. Patrice K manipulates the marks made irrationally, entirely by chance. When being photocopied, an overexposed photo reacts better than a carefully made print. It is this image, the photocopy, that K. used for his film. His films are characterized by accidental marks. And K. knows how to relate to one mark rather than another.
