Black Night  Few bands are more closely associated with Montreux than Deep Purple and there was simply no other contender when it came to choosing the act to headline the closing night of the 40th Festival in 2006. In response the band delivered one of their finest concerts including a show-stopping performance of \"Smoke on the Water\". As an added bonus. The DVD and Blu-ray features the whole of Deep Purple's 60 minute show at London's Hard Rock Cafe earlier in the same year.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/7hfTS0H8sVDZ32zD4pRfF8DW1Dd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Purple: Live at Montreux 2006","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
