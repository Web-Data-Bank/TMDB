The documentary, directed by Lutz Becker, attempts to remain as objective as possible, serving as a neutral observer of the years 1918 through 1933 in Germany. Via newsreel footage and clips of features from the era, the film offers a kaleidoscopic view of the many elements that fueled the rise of the Socialist Nationalist Party, including post-WWI poverty. Hitler occupies a central place in the documentary.","popularity":0.981,"poster_path":"/91btXQvMa87ons4po0pAwqybBtU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Headed Eagle: Hitler's Rise to Power 1918-1933","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":4}
