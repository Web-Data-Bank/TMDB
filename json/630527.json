She is travelling in the cube-shaped space ship. On her way she meets abnormal phenomena. The further she goes, the more the reality mixes up with dream-like sequences. At the end of the journey, she arrives at a place with a mirror-like object. The astronaut leaves her space ship and goes through to another side of the mirror. That causes the creation of a doppelganger and causes even more deconstruction to reality. The astronaut’s helmet is taken off and then she is sitting at a table at a bar on (probably) Earth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2L4GTqpIv3YjJBECqCX5GFKFcdD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2019-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Odds and Evens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
