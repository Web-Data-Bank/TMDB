The film unfolds in waves. Locations appear, disappear, and come round again – Lewinsky Park, Maximilian Park, Habima Square, Lion Square, Zuccotti Park, Times Square or pastoral landscapes at opposite ends of the Mediterranean Sea. The actions are the same: people wait, pass by, kill time. No refugees in the picture here, no demonstrators or soldiers, no spectacle. It is a film running alongside events, alongside time. A contemporary film in the pure sense of the word - a way of being with time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Now","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
