The magical dreams of his youth appear from time to time, but daily routine quickly takes over. His striving for material wealth – including a Trabant car, a shelving unit, a boat – leads him to betray his youthful ideals, and he ultimately becomes a slave to his possessions. In the final frames of the film, “LIVE” – written in large white letters – ironically reminds viewers not to forget to follow their dreams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k0oeymjrZewoTPKqn3aBPvMWrpy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
