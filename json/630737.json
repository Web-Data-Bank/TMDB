Under pressure and with a promise to make him walk again, Mills agrees to volunteer. He is injected with a synthetic nanomaterial and suffocated, only to wake up with restored use of his legs, yet alone in a steel cell in the first spoke of an experimental apparatus - The Wheel. A series of assailants inflict a multitude of damage to Mills' body and torment his mind, yet the synthetic nanomaterial not only restores his damaged organs, it re-engineers his strength. The experiment might be designed to kill, but Mills is determined to survive - and get back to his daughter before The Board finds her first.","popularity":3.248,"poster_path":"/8oPmyEEtJsi59n2y0uwHSAae5BX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106364,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunjive Studios","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":122952,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Wheel Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Break him, till he breaks free.","title":"2099: The Soldier Protocol","video":false,"vote_average":4.909,"vote_count":11}
