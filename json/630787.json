She flies to the place of her dreams and meets a frog who is also seeking something new. Despite their differences, the two animals become friends and start their adventure together. This children’s animation film was a success in East German cinemas. Older viewers, however, saw it as a metaphor for their longing to escape – daily life, or even their walled-in country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yFXGGDdHUtk0GOdDWEGTpJd1yeL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Discovery","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
