Frustration and anger in the nation and the world. Nothing new about that. The eternal return, and yet a reality unknown to a child. I have featured children in many of my films and the 'Loss of Innocence' theme is often present or implied. The film involves sound that goes both forward and backward, images of American football violence, a lot of scraps going around and around to nowhere. There is also a child, (our daughter Rebekah) and a tricycle. Each viewer will have a unique response. Eye of the beholder.\" â€“Abbott Meader","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eTsZjJt8zPIJnetAmQGwJvCIIWw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Racetrack","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
