Over 200,000 feet of silent film were shot before production had to be stopped due to exhaustion of finances and Stalin's demands that Eisenstein return to the USSR.  This is one of several attempts to make a feature film out of the existing footage, here according to Eisenstein's skeletal outline and under the supervision of Gregori Alexandrov, Eisenstein's long-time collaborator, including on this project.","popularity":22.806,"poster_path":"/kA5Y4Ucw1m1VwpDk0xDcBLL5DHu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1979-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Que Viva Mexico!","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":41}
