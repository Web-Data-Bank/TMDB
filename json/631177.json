In Judenrein, meaning free of Jews, the director examines amateur footage of the 1980s in a small Polish village, rescued to find answers about his story, in a biographical reflection. In Levantados do Chão, a philharmonic band traverses an abandoned hotel in the Azores, and the emptiness left by the ruins thus refers to a past that is still present and prevalent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raised from the Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
