He brought only music recorded tapes. He wants to write on music, the main question being for him: what represents music for man? He tells eight experiments done in different places or occasions (in a car, at the opera, at a rock gig, listening a walkman,..). He expresses how the way you are listening can affect your feelings and reflection. His voice and his written words appearing on screen are the mental counterpoint of silent images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Musique sans cesse et table rase","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
