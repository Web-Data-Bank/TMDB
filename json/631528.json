No? Well neither had a rather bemused Nick Briggs until he caught up with John Leeson on location for the Doctor Who drama Downtime. Ten years earlier, it was all a lot easier for Keith Harrison when he interviewed John for the second Myth Makers. Life was simple then, you just sat down and had a nice chat about life and being the voice of K9.  Now, you have to run around the inside of the Doctorâ€™s faithful robot companion, plus learn how to cook (and more importantly how to catch) a Yeti! Well these are the ingredients, its all been cooking in the oven, so take your seats for dinner. Confused...? Not half as much as Nick!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kt3eFrJGajmXyHEPe9bob7z4DuJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 2: John Leeson","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
