Leipziger Herbstsalon","overview":"In 1984, the “First Leipzig Autumn Salon” took place – a risk and a caesura for Dammbeck. Bypassing every state institution, six painters, sculptors and filmmakers organised an art exhibition. It was the first and last of its kind. This recapture of public space through art challenged the government’s monopoly on power and triggered similar activities by other artists in the art centres of the GDR. A brave signal to the SED who saw this exhibition as a “counter-revolutionary development”. After that, there were only two options: regress or leave.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z74XPalBJgLphWIOdzZnjQUk28u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lutz Dammbeck Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Leipzig Autumn Salon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
