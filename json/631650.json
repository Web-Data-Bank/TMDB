These ten films encapsulate the best of De Keersmaeker and De Mey's collaboration: twenty years of assiduously practicing variation, of perpetually inventing algorithms, filters, and formulae that twist movement and space according to the capricious mathematics of pleasure. All of this is filmed - O Belgitude! - in exquisite flower-filled gardens and under impressionistic drizzling rain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aKgvT5csd9osA89lyVaLyCf0h4Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avila","origin_country":""},{"id":112812,"logo_path":null,"name":"ICTUS","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":82719,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2003-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Counter Phrases","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
