Instead he unknowingly ends up working for demons that commission him to write the most evil book of sorcery known to man:  the Necronomicon.  It’s an epic tale of evil vs. slightly less evil as an inter-dimensional battle rages between horrific monsters of the H.P. Lovecraft mythos. Earth is the battleground, and it’s up to one human to save the world; the very man that haphazardly awoke the monsters in the first place - Abdul Alhazred.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fhtagn Rock Opera of Dooom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
