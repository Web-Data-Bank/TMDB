The Italian title translates as The Moon-Skinned Girl, a reference to the amazingly attractive Zeudi Araya, who made two other films with the same director. As a film it really typifies the 'eurotika' of the 1970s - the story concerns a couple with marital problems who escape to the Seychelles and the husband meets - and has an affair with - the title character. The wife meanwhile meets an ex-pat living there (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart!) with whom she has a fling. The couple realise their love for each other and return home stronger for it.","popularity":2.94,"poster_path":"/bwTv09w6RVH2QVux1KMCECUkgRl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produzioni Atlas Consorziate","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":23852,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aquila Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl with the Moon Skin","video":false,"vote_average":3.833,"vote_count":3}
