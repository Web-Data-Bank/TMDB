Porn is becoming less taboo, sex is an app-swipe away, and stigmas are fading as the need to lie about who we are - while still challenging - has become less so. We face new challenges as we embrace our newfound openness, like the need to tribalize (and even fetishize) sex, race and masculinity) as we sign in, upload, and check off the buttons of preference on our way to pre-negotiated sex. That is why I have asked some of the boys and men I know to openly share their authentic self in Just Being Me. Guys like Alex Mecum, Ben Masters, Carter Dane, Clark Davis, Levi Karter, Mateo Vice, Taylor Reign, and Ty Mitchell share their experiences and thoughts of challenges they've endured and how they've come to realize that they've just got to be themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nydhI5rwO2hJxRg4VQd7lieiriP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78808,"logo_path":"/waBhPFHbQyMCHBjUBQJospx6DiJ.png","name":"Cocky Boys","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Being Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
