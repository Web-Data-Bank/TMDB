Two strangers, Blue and Bordeaux, find themselves in a bunker. White makes its appearance and breaks the psycho-chromatic balances of the characters. Fear suddenly becomes hate, and the two end up fighting. The memories of a man travel in VHS and lacerate the clear images on the screen. Where they arrive, they upset. The three situations seem interconnected by an aleatory principle of cause-effect, the three characters by the same purpose.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ISOLATE BLUE AND BORDEAUX?","title":"NOTTI BIANCHE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
