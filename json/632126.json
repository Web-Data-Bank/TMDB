The belief at the time was that it was better to die of starvation than to compromise one's chastity. Many widows had to live a life of loneliness in the name of defending their chastities. Han, a widow, prays to the gods asking them to alleviate her loneliness. Her devotion moves them and she is given a wooden ball. When one chants \"What is it used for?\", the ball turns into a man. When the word gets out, all the widows in the village want to take possession of this heavenly gift from the gods. When a conflict to possess the ball ensues between Han and Oh, another widow, the village lord decides to cut it in half.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jZnltvEXgID3ubEcyRmsnR94pIA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117052,"logo_path":null,"name":"Koryo Films Co., Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1993-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Will Survive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
