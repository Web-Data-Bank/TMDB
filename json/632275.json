The former provides some good background and anecdotes about the movie; Vogler takes more of a symbolic and interpretive view of Rambo. He traces the path followed by our hero through all three movies and connects it to mythology and other basic story-telling notions. \"Journey\" manages to end the documentaries in a reasonably rich and useful way.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/81jEnFj7ADkwlHVtRbiRWtF5DjR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An American Hero's Journey: The Rambo Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
