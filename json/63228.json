Jeanne Moreau stars as Berthe Pedret, a simple laundry woman who marries Hector (Michael Auclair), son of a wealthy, upper class, Spanish immigrant family that owns a successful farm machinery factory. Through a series of vignettes, Techine depicts the passage of years, during which the ambitious working class woman blooms through several bold moves, such as negotiating a workers' strike settlement and using her alliance with the war-time French Resistance movement to increase the enterprise's prestige.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/iNk1f8VV7eAMs9BfHH2toy4PXzq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stéphan Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":113171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buffalo Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":82,"logo_path":null,"name":"Renn Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belstar Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":21466,"logo_path":null,"name":"Simar Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1975-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"French Provincial","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":8}
