The artists’ research crosses four bodies of water — the Mediterranean sea; and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans — to connect four disparate islands: Lesvos, Haiti, Marshall Islands and Tiwi. Each island holds within it stories of tremendous violence, but also the potential for otherwise. The film assembles fragments that touch on a kind of knowledge embedded in a moment preceding human history or geological timescales — a moment of total entanglement described by the artists as Deep Implicancy. In excavating the link between geological shifts and material realities, they ask: can an earthquake release the knowledge for a revolution in the very way we know the world?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dY2UjxzGgfrYgq3PZhgIy6ZfSO7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"4 Waters: Deep Implicancy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
