I found that the evil forces had no evil, and when they got some evidence, they were caught by the evil gangs. Lin Geling’s father was very angry and worried about the news. He urgently summoned his bodyguard team to pick out five elites to go to the rescue. The rescue process was very difficult. Fortunately, the leaders received strong support to rescue the songs and other victims.
