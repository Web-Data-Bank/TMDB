Thus the program explains the political background of the establishment of the totalitarian Soviet state and of its economic, social, and cultural policies—the precise institutions and policies that would in our time cause the destruction of what Lenin created by the force of his single-minded personality, his political acuity, his powerful oratory...and the weaknesses of the divided democratic opposition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lenin According to Lenin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
