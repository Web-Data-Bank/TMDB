Their every-day lifestyle, made of creating matchstick models on one side, researching the big-foot myth on the other, and the boy's constant need to find places for hiding is briefly interrupted by a visit from two tourists: husband and his young wife - traveling to visit a cave near the weather station, so they'd mark their five year anniversary. Their arrival is the primer for an unknown series of events that puts an experienced inspector and his young colleague where we find them at the beginning of the movie: on a deserted weather station, where everyone seems to have vanished into thin air. The hank slowly unrolls as viewer discovers the truth behind everything, step by step, until the final loop of a long story line unravels and present him the final surprise.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/DHGsXOKaZT2dO5AfcQt4BS9m4h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72073,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaskad Films","origin_country":""},{"id":318,"logo_path":"/q0UG4oZERwIywJdDPF4lRlvdYGW.png","name":"CTB Film Company","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":16079,"logo_path":"/6BF18oLINXIs1FZCZBAV1JOJx5h.png","name":"Star Media","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-04-15","revenue":101186,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weather Station","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
