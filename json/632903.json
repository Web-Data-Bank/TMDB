From the initial panic to awareness campaigns, passing through the stigma imposed on people living with HIV, the documentary shows how society faced this epidemic in its deadliest phase over more than two decades. With this historical approach as its base, the film looks at the way HIV is viewed in today's society, revealing a picture of persistent misinformation and prejudice, which especially affects Brazil’s most historically vulnerable populations.","popularity":1.234,"poster_path":"/aQakkvHa2BFChEvPHzm9iPvvyHC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canto Produções","origin_country":""},{"id":166659,"logo_path":null,"name":"Descoloniza Filmes","origin_country":""},{"id":181011,"logo_path":"/xCbWYpwimNBSOmznDoS3gMsa6Lz.png","name":"Secretaria de Cultura e Economia Criativa do Estado de São Paulo","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":181427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Menezes Produções","origin_country":""},{"id":181428,"logo_path":null,"name":"MIZI","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"HIV and AIDS in Brazil","title":"Letter Beyond the Walls","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":12}
