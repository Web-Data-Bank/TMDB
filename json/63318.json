Pauline is a middle-class city girl, at odds with her very conventional family. Suzanne is several years older, a country girl with two illegitimate children and another (whom she cannot support) on the way. Pauline loans Suzanne money for an abortion. At this point, the two separate and communicate mainly through postcards. Some years later, they meet at an abortion rally, and they have many adventures and stories to share with one another.","popularity":5.069,"poster_path":"/b3YTxT8LM1AWeWyrAXd3b0kjjzz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné-Tamaris","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":119162,"logo_path":null,"name":"INLC","origin_country":""},{"id":85389,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradise","origin_country":""},{"id":119163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Population","origin_country":""},{"id":6849,"logo_path":"/AjdOGHRLAhWbP1aAga85A9EOfD2.png","name":"SFP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":22642,"logo_path":"/gqFSMOsv68FkYalHrKbUvq3pGwh.png","name":"Ina","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1977-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You are not born a woman… you become one.","title":"One Sings, the Other Doesn't","video":false,"vote_average":7.182,"vote_count":74}
