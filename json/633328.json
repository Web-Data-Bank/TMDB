John will later refer to himself as a “brand plucked from the burning.” As a man, Wesley tries to live out that special purpose on his own strength and good works, but it only brings frustration and failure.  Finally, after years of struggle, Wesley embraces saving grace! But his new message is not welcome in the established churches. Will John break all the rules and take his message outside the church walls to the needy and outcast?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qsngexC9lYJcbg3QzqSHRL3HtGW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The founder of the Methodist movement showed us faith that works. .","title":"Torchlighters: The John Wesley Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
