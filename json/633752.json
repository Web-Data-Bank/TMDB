The 1990s were years of newfound engagement and activism among the young, if we are to believe the international press and its invocation of a new class of anarchist, \"anti-globalization\" youth. Price gives voice and image to this clich√© in what is at once a screen-test, an audition, and a proposition with no clear intent or message.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Folk Music & Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
