This history of colonial law-making forged political and sometimes profane relation- ships between humans and animals. Bambitchell’s essayistic film reimagines common perceptions of legal history and, in doing so, produces a world where past and present, fiction and non-fiction, human and animal fuse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/psfr2e38n7SaSWzFP474lOoRdTU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bugs and Beasts Before the Law","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
