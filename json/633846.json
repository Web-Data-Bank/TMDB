The stunning imagery comes solely from the window of the Trans-Siberian train, shot first in 1987-8 and then again in 2007-8. The re-enactment of the journey is a memory work, a re-enactment of the past in the present through the process of filming. But the return journey is haunted by the voices of two dead friends that dominate the soundscape of the 'archive' footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lAzHWha8AkQaAwA27k3hoQ2uwqw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perestroika","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
