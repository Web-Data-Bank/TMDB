Two young, lost souls in New York City share a common struggle - they are stuck in lives they do not feel they belong to. She is an adored actress and he, a bike messenger. On the outside they seem like each other's opposite, but on the inside they are the same- dehumanized by an internal loneliness that alienates them from feeling alive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yDvJIAGpOCH2neWzLGce4P7uuZm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123368,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emotional Elements","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indigo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
