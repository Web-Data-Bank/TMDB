Known for its dangerous, unsupervised rides and lack of regulation, guests of Action Park expected to walk away with injuries and were lucky if they made it out alive. Shirking the trappings of nostalgia, the film uses investigative journalism, original animations,  recordings, and interviews with the people who lived it to reveal the true story of Action Park.","popularity":5.371,"poster_path":"/AoNojvxMhZtdVu9V8LtjfXJ6TPT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139339,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perennial Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":139396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pinball Party Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":139397,"logo_path":null,"name":"strategery, films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Class Action Park","video":false,"vote_average":6.599,"vote_count":101}
