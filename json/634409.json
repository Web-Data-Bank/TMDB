Each character, from a porcine union-jack doting politician to a phone-addicted white cat, stand in as an archetype in the UKâ€™s political landscape as it considers its exit from the European Union. Set apart on independent monitors, these anthropomorphized incarnations menace one another through tacit acts of ridicule in a perpetually cycling theatre, falling between farcical and cruel. Maclean points us to the mechanisms of belonging and nativeness at play in the performance of national identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qtr4y88QS6kjF5xgsiTPWTi5ep6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Native Animals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
