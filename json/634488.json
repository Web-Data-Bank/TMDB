I was struck by the redemptive critical and visionary character of his work which struck me as similar to G.M. Hopkins or Clarence Smith. Coincidentally as I was shooting these films I went to a screening of Charles Burnett and asked him what film he would like to make but couldn't get the money for. He replied, \"a feature narrative about Tyree Suyton.\"  So I put together four of the films from Spring 2000 into a four-film work called \"4 For Charles Burnett - All That's Solid Melts Into Air\". They are: ALL THAT'S SOLID, LIGHT LICK, TOSCANINI'S EUROPEAN SIDEWALK CAFE, and MELTS INTO AIR.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hUd7Vu4zQwLAcdNxTdbJAFAqjF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melts Into Air","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
