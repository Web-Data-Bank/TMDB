The doors were still locked, and the music industry held the keys. Young artists began to self-market on the Internet, ultimately helping to collapse the music industry as we knew it. Itâ€™s Yours explores how it became possible to become a rap star through a Twitter account, YouTube site or Myspace page.  It tells this story through the unique perspectives of numerous artists, producers, record industry insiders, and music and cultural critics.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/8Y3vhfj12dfb6TnetKQlIO1gUGg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145322,"logo_path":null,"name":"LA STEREO TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Yours: A Film on Hip-Hop and the Internet","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
