The negatives of the photographs gradually appear over the flow of images. The images once hung on the walls, are subjected to a series of bizarre performative actions by a group of young people, as if at an opening (including the artist Ugo Nespolo and the filmmakers Renato Ferraro and Gioachino Nichot), who then shift into a dance with playful and erotic overtones. Two versions of the film exist, one developed positive and one negative. â€”Tate Modern","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gk6Nj2jlRJN4Pl0EFz0VpzHXtIi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria Fotografia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
