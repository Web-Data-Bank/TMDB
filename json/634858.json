Every weekend, thousands of amateur players, from schoolboys to office executives to retirees, gather to play the Beautiful Game. Not for glory, not for fame; but for passion, football and friendship. This spirit is forged in the neighbourhoods; void decks, street soccer courts, open fields or any patch of grass. All across Singapore, footballers have a place they call their ‘Homeground’.  For the first time, this football culture is captured on film. Homeground is a love letter to playing spaces we call home, and a tribute to all amateur footballers in Singapore","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qvHpQp1lRpsKM7OK7byF5u9JMaj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2015-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A love letter to playing spaces we call home","title":"Homeground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
