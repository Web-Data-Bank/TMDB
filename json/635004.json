How, no matter how strongly you feel about your position, you're only ever seeing your side of the story. It's a film about the complexity of relationships and, in many ways, an allegory to the complexities of what it feels like to live in today's society, where our instincts are to judge quickly and fact check later.","popularity":20.27,"poster_path":"/u0YOkfVGyjbkttQZMicHkE6u5xB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114045,"logo_path":"/a1cfHUTXRLDkiKTXyXSTjTAyXgf.png","name":"Adult Time","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"You don't know what you have... until you lose It\"","title":"Perspective","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":4}
