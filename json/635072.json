They created an animation festival that helped launch the careers of John Lasseter, Peter Lord, Will Vinton, Bill Plympton and Mike Judge to name just a few. Their Spike & Mike festival had an enormous impact on animation that was felt the world over. The festival was known as much for the breakthrough animation it presented as the outrageous antics of the founders.","popularity":1.681,"poster_path":"/bK1HZfueyD0F5EKi25o5S2i3y0f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Circus PR","origin_country":""},{"id":123522,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sneaky Little Sister Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animation Outlaws","video":true,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
