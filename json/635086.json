Each of these three sections of the image shows a separately recorded one-second-long camera pan shot in the artist’s studio. The camera pans were filmed with a 16 mm film camera equipped with three different types of lenses (wide-angle, normal and telephoto). The resulting footage was divided horizontally into three strips and rearranged into new collaged compositions, each lasting 32 seconds, which were mechanically printed together into a single 35mm film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qfanWv2t3JagZnEXyj4kFFyI7r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triolets","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
