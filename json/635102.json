This road trip takes the young woman, who is still haunted by her loss, from Hiroshima to Tokyo and Fukushima and all the way to Ōtsuchi, where her family home once stood. On the way she encounters other people, other stories, other lives and other losses. Landscapes and faces. The journey ends in the middle of a garden in full bloom among the scarred surroundings of her coastal hometown.. In it stands a telephone box which, even though it is no longer connected, is used to speak to those who cannot be reached any other way.","popularity":1.388,"poster_path":"/bRwZd69oR92mTGXR4KdPjtzNnjY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40523,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broadmedia Studios","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"CAN I COME WITH YOU?","title":"Voices in the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":6}
