From that moment on, a confusing chronicle of the last day in the girl's life begins, during which she will travel a long way - from the city to the dacha, and then into the thicket to the river. On this day, Yanka will have time to see and talk with many people, real and imaginary, even with those who are no longer alive. It seems that Yankee's next step is about to shed light on the circumstances of her mysterious death: hopeless love, arguments with loved ones, disagreements with herself, strange meetings with strangers in the forest.","popularity":0.951,"poster_path":"/zDb9BSpMfxOqe4u6U7V0IFL2Mes.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71156,"logo_path":"/jnYrp67FATgZgyP5Qvy9VgxvBR.png","name":"Hype Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Down by the Water","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
