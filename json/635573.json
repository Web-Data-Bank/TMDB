You too can digest this banquet of artists, poets and movie-makers as this foray into fleeting fame runs its course on a highway of film oriented locales.  See the Harvard Film Archive in all its spaciousness and visit the citadel of cinema, Anthology Film Archives, before winding up in a Greenwich Village bar full of verbal beauty.  A trip for young and old who like to sit in one spot and watch someone else deal with the traffic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a2Il6ClfROHJSVXXkHZ9eeKYeHY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zealots of the Zinc Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
