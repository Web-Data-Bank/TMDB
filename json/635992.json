When a solar storm leaves the region without power, myriad dramas unfold over the course of five days during which all conveniences of modernity are stripped away. In Costa Rica, a pastor and his daughter worry for the future of their church, while in El Salvador, a grandmother and grandson make an arduous journey into the city. A husband and wife reconnect in Honduras, as a young couple nurses a mysterious stranger back to health in Guatemala. Meanwhile, in Nicaragua, a young woman prepares for her quinceañera and in Panama, a housekeeper grows exasperated with her demanding employer.","popularity":1.085,"poster_path":"/5CkFgrBMqAIJ3vE3HXgTWdx4k1F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142028,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dos Sentidos Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":142029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mente Pública","origin_country":""},{"id":142030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lupe Lupe Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":84858,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trípode Audiovisual","origin_country":""},{"id":142031,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comunicadores Asociados","origin_country":""},{"id":142032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chicken Bus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"},{"iso_3166_1":"SV","name":"El Salvador"},{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"},{"iso_3166_1":"HN","name":"Honduras"},{"iso_3166_1":"NI","name":"Nicaragua"},{"iso_3166_1":"PA","name":"Panama"}],"release_date":"2019-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What would happen if there was a power shutdown in Central America?","title":"Days of Light","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
