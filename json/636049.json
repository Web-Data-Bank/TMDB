It was a journey in search of the sun and a light that would heal him from his chronic bronchitis and the sadness in which he was submerged. An expedition in search of beauty, to the lands of the sun.  Solar Lands presents this little-mentioned moment in the life of Darío, but it also helps us to learn about his life and the main characteristics and importance of his complete work from the hand of specialists and high-level women and men of letters. The actor Pedro Casablanc gives voice to the verses of Rubén Darío in this beautiful documentary, which was Laura Hojman's first directing work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xsCNiV7PZt4ENOkEAVqexeFzMKP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Summer Films","origin_country":""},{"id":132000,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sarao Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solar Lands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
