Religion is a tough subject for many in the LGBTQ community, and this piece is a reflection of the struggle and rejection we often feel. It tells the story of an individual troubled by the hate in the world and his partner who is fighting to lift him up, to remind him he is beautiful exactly how he is. My message is that religion should inspire more kindness and open arms, even towards those you may not understand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oyQQdvYIDKO2qDnuLYg1CTFtf7D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hallelujah","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2}
