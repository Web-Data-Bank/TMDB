Around the swimming pool, we get to know each tree, each grandchild that is born, each family celebration, which Antonio films painstakingly while adding a live narration. A film that pauses on the lyric of domestic life, at the same time as, through the past, it investigates a current theme: how what is around us is affected by constant recording, what does it mean to experience each event through the mediation of a device.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pAhrhM8aERRlKYrYmQsjSqdpKXl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los pilares","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
