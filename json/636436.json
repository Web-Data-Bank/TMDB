However Tess is reluctant to go: she fears the stormy waters and would rather stay at home for the summer with her best friend, Candice. Tess does go, and with her goes Maa-mou the cat, a parting gift from Candice, as her lively companion. Together they rise to the challenges of life on a fishing boat, and thrill in the summer's unexpected pleasures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vpBf31OED7ZDAmQPvhQ6SrczDoX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Reluctant Deckhand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
