Throughout the film, she seeks to create a common ground with other people. Despite her hunger to do so, she fails with people of the opposite sex, and so turns to her own gender. Again, she meets with failure; and again, she is knocked sideways. Just like all of us, Şükran keeps looking helplessly for ways to communicate with other people until the bitter end. Her helplessness may not be the exact same to our own helplessness as spectators, but they are indeed in very close proximity.","popularity":1.783,"poster_path":"/aLcVr8vFJejbFTlURWkpKNpE5bX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95515,"logo_path":"/s8AcFIuTOujixDTHRFGm5MtSrFy.png","name":"TN Yapım","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2019-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of Sukran the Lame","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
