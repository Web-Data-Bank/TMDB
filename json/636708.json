The arrival of the FBI confirms his suspicions that something bigger – perhaps extraterrestrial – is at play. The hunt for the killer puts him face-to-face with a humanoid beast who will stop at nothing to exterminate the one witness to the crime. As the hunt becomes personal with the abduction of his wife, everything the police officer knows about the universe will be challenged, and our connection to other life forces in the universe will be revealed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":110799,"logo_path":"/eHjtiQJjrGQTooEsBmPSYoUnNB.png","name":"AGC Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Inferno","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
