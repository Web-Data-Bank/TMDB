Filmed in a comedy club in Mumbai, the show has everything you'd expect from live stand up - plenty of thoughts that are of no use to humankind. If you have an hour to waste, this is a good way to do it.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/6osASKH2pIa0N30BDS1G8D1OQsn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pata Nahi Par Bolna Hai: A Comedy Special by Karunesh Talwar","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
