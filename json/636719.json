The title is based on an expression from my coming-of-age in Acadian French Canada where girls would refer to having their menstrual periods as “être dans ses fleurs”. As a result of incubation in menstrual blood for several months, the original images inscribed on the emulsion undergo violent alterations. The shedding of the unfertilized womb depredates the fertilized blossoms and substitutes its own dark beauty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iuEcCWGCJrz5fuo1nGiBcjTTAMw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Libre Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jours en fleurs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
