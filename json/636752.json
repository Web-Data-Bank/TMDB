During the Edo era, while a pacified Japan isolated itself from the world, audacious Japanese artists innovated stylization, abstraction, minimalism, surrealism, geometric composition and the illusion of 3-D. Their elegant originality is most striking in images of the natural world depicted on folding screens and scrolls by Sotatsu, Korin, Okyo, Rosetsu, Shohaku and many others who left their art unsigned.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dhC5MfwXoeHNAJSmQ7IyHXKgqFu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edo Avant-Garde","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
