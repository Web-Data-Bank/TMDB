It left its audience hovering between hushed reverence and deafening exultation.

And there Karajan s Berliner never sounded better, evoking a time which selfconfidently sought the private and subjective in music, and believed it could find them in the mirror of the works (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung). It is a concert that commemorates Herbert von Karajan for the ages in a supremely moving manner.  Beethoven: Violin Concerto, Tchaikovsky: Symphony No. 6, Bach: Sarabande,br.
