It was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name by Rice. For his work on Street Scene, Weill received the first Tony Award for Best Original Score.  In Germany, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Weill had already begun to use American jazz and popular song elements in his operas. After fleeing from Germany in 1933, he worked in Paris, then England, and then, beginning in 1935, in New York. Weill made a study of American popular and stage music and worked to further adapt his music to new American styles in his writing for Broadway, film and radio. He strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be both commercially and artistically successful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mFViMl1lYRKbQ2EbCXXd11gnCbT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kurt Weill - Street Scene","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
