They live in different parts of Europe: Western Europe -Catalonia (Spain); Eastern Europe -Lithuania; and in the new Europe -Georgia (Akhazia). They have experienced, in different parts of the 20Th century, civil wars and dictatorships. They share the same fate: they stayed where they were born. This film is about people who decide to do nothing in times of war, oppression and occupation. They choose a life amidst the ruins of their past. Even when this choice leads to loneliness: living a dream, not a reality. Alone, between the graves of their loved ones, they spend their last days. They have frozen their lives by protecting themselves from the outside world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hPJkmY8MnbnC6JChEz6siks8xHr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49794,"logo_path":"/bFqE3eQjWlVjValkuzoBHIY3uV2.png","name":"Zeppers","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2012-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Smoke of the Fatherland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
