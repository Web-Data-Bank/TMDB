From the calculating chief monk and the meat-eating womanizer to the silver-tongued moneymaker and the vain Instagram heartthrob, they all seem more interested in self-gain than asceticism. Nevertheless, the worldly monks have to respond to an unsavoury truth about Do-Bub. In the subsequent days, memories are awakened and characters tested as the monks reflect on their experiences, desires, and fears, as well as the realization that someone will have to be Do-Bub’s successor.","popularity":0.887,"poster_path":"/V65RZ0CLIlt3xjbhDCoHoQIGTV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128067,"logo_path":null,"name":"AVANT-GARDE FILM","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samsara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
