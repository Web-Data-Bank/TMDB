The village lives and breathes in unison. The Chechen gravediggers are always busy. Death is an everyday visitor. It does not even matter that yet another war has ended. The people live stuck in a circle of vengeance. They also gather into circles to chant prayers to God. Only the cows are grazing calmly next to the cemetery and the children are happily going about their business. The Chechens' parting words to one another are, \"May you come back free!\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iYHcZdTYn7MlvaTWiSy85PT5fXh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103826,"logo_path":null,"name":"OÜ Vesilind","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Chechen","iso_639_1":"ce","name":""},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come Back Free","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
