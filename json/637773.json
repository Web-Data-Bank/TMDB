To launch on this adventure, he did what anyone else would do - he quit his high paying job at Disney, leaving behind a successful 20 year career. It seemed to make so much sense at the time! With Disney in the rear-view, Randall launched his self-proclaimed 'Mad Plan' and began crafting small-batch bass guitars full time. From a beginner's electrifying success to near break-down, this is a beautiful, honest and inspirational portrait of a passionate craftsperson who walked headlong into a foolhardy dream. This is a true tale of a life unwound and restrung.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aLyA7dVXEbkPS5Ei3rapN9S6kHZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enns Visuals","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"From electrifying success to near break-down, this is a true tale of a man with a mad plan whose life was unwound - and restrung.","title":"Restrung","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
