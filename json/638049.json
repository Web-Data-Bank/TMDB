Berg's uncompromising portrayal of brutality and madness generated much controversy, but the significance of Wozzeck was soon recognised; its compelling lyrical expansiveness, large-scale dramatic gestures and remarkable musical structures producing music of overwhelming emotional intensity. The Financial Times declared this to be 'a beautiful, moving, engrossing production… this is a consummate Wozzeck, blending clarity, lyricism, compassion and crushing force.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rBuVWf0mVO9SgkbbCfcZVfPlvjx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch National Opera","origin_country":""},{"id":110411,"logo_path":null,"name":"Francois Roussillon Et Associés","origin_country":""},{"id":25564,"logo_path":"/hOMyGLs7mSWoDzVkGDYgK0BdVo6.png","name":"Mezzo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alban Berg - Wozzeck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
