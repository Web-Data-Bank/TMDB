The doctor torments him with absurd medical experiments; the captain humiliates and ridicules him. And Wozzeck’s lover, Marie (Gun-Brit Barkmin), with whom he has a child, cuckolds him with the drum major. Wozzeck becomes a murderer, stabbing Marie to death. Georg Büchner’s drama fragment, on which Alban Berg based his first opera, is an unflinching case study of social injustice and human suffering. But it is also a grotesque piece that thrives on exaggeration – and in which only a fine line separates the unfathomable from the ridiculous. Accordingly, director Andreas Homoki forgoes all realism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tKpZ3KxoT0rLQvbZBK7jKlxIWP3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accentus Music","origin_country":""},{"id":72207,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opernhaus Zürich","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alban Berg - Wozzeck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
