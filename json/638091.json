His only confidante is his best friend (Sivakumar Palakrishnan, \"A Yellow Bird\", Cannes Film Festival 2016 Critics' Week).  Desperately clinging onto the material symbols of his past success, he unlocks a hibernating malevolent force, with sinister roots in long-buried secrets. As his dream life crumbles around him, worlds collide, the lines between then and now become increasingly blurred, and Jim descends into a waking nightmare.  REPOSSESSION is a bold, genre-bending film, with an ever-evolving, haunting soundscape from Golden Horse Award-winning composer Teo Wei Yong (\"A Land Imagined\").","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/saeSdrFGwdHccJ26PR35rloGrt2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123919,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monkey \u0026 Boar","origin_country":""},{"id":123919,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monkey \u0026 Boar","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2021-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Repossession","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
