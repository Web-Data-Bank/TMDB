The movie also examines the life of Brandon Bond and his struggle with balancing fame, fortune and the Rock-N-Roll tattoo lifestyle with a more fulfilling life that focuses on the betterment of both animals and society as a whole. Featuring celebrities like Debbie and Danny Trejo, Michael Berryman, Pixie Acia and Donal Logue, the movie takes you on an incredible journey you will never forget!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vicktory To The Underdog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
