As a reward for receiving high marks at school, she goes on a peaceful jaunt to the countryside to visit her aunt and uncle. Naturally, she trips the gardener, futzes with her aunt’s expensive perfume, terrifies the cooks by levitating pots and pans (with hidden string!), enjoys a bacchanalian feast of grapes and sausage, and then jumps out the window. Her uncle banishes her with a stern warning for tyrannizing their idyllic home. But Léontine does not appear chastised.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mnd4EGbgx1AyTvACnRJGKXJfqd5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1910-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Léontine on Vacation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
