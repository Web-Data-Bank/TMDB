Misfit","overview":"Julia's life is wonderful. She lives in the United States, goes to a great school, sings, and runs a popular online channel. Just an \"American dream\". One day, when her parents decide to return to Poland, everything will change. Julia will have to find herself in a new school - Millennium High School, ruled by \"teams\": athletes, nerds, vloggers, musicians, fans of a beautiful look, and VIPs, led by the self-righteous Victoria. Together with Magenta, the school's outsider, and Kuba, the unfulfilled musician, they will create a group of the excluded. An annual music competition will be held at school soon, in which the winners will be a scholarship and a trip to the United States. Julia cannot miss this opportunity.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/dcW8ZQrqbdzbbq2S4AcpSaNJpBl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tako Media","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2019-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"#IAmM","title":"#Jestem M.
