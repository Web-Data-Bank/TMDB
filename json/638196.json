It captures their subjective memories, often frozen in time and in everyday life. Only strong impressions of sadness, joy, suffering, which reflect the great history of the 20th century. There is no truth about the past, it is only the human mind that actually makes morytates - bloody enlightening stories and legends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legends and Morytates of Ladomirova","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
