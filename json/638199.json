It's capturing a fantasy you're having when you're wide awake and life is going on around you. There is, of course, a similarity between daydreaming and making any kind of art because they both spring from that narrow groove between the subconscious and the conscious. That's when self-expression and technical problem-solving both flow together in an almost mystical way. For me this film represents that mental state. I shot it in late July 2001 but put it away for some forgotten reason. It's very much about everyday lifeâ€“a nondescript New York neighborhood on a calm Sunday afternoon, garbage cans piled high, feet reading here and there . . . but it's also about the magic I can see in that world when I free my subconscious. I made this film so effortlessly (I just cut out one brief shot) because I was so fully in that mindset, which, I think, shows in the nature of the images.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fC5UYSv926D3pINyf7HTBhW9hJT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
