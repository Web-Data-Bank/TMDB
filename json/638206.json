From his monumental installation, The Weather Project, in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in 2003 to his recent interventions in climate change and global migration, his is an art which strives to change the world every step of the way.  In 2019, the Danish-Icelandic artist returns to Tate Modern with his landmark exhibition, In Real Life, surveying the breadth of his career from his beginnings as an art student in Copenhagen through to the latest pieces created in his vast studio laboratory in Berlin. Much of his work is shaped by his response to his parents' home country of Iceland and the interplay of water and light showcased in its natural phenomena.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8egm0vrOPYdqYesfR69Kx4g7g8F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olafur Eliasson: Miracles of Rare Device","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
