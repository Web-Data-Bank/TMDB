Lacking an ongoing narrative frame, the film combines fragments of stories from various places, embedded in the images, fictional or auto-biographical, told through the voices scattered throughout the film’s soundtrack, and elsewhere through the captions that bring a momentary sense of order through their consistently neat positioning. Fragmented and distorted, the text, sound, and images are, nevertheless, mashed up into a structure of its own idiosyncratic logic, style, and narration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bodies Without Bodies in Outer Space","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
