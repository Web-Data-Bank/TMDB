A man lives a lonely, exquisite lifestyle in his large, empty apartment. He hears a noise, of a man stumbling through the window in his bedroom. The man has a gun, and he shakes while he holds it. What follows is a tender, complex exploration of lust and desire between two very talented performers and the faultless Direction of Mathews.","popularity":2.613,"poster_path":"/cS5kdipVYXQQvXGXs9raC9Um1GA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Erika Lust Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A robbery takes an unexpected twist in this Brazilian tour-de-force exploring power, sensuality and sex.","title":"Intruders","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
