It seems to her that the man cares more about his work than about her. Rein really loves his work, but his wife just as passionately. He does not understand how loneliness can overwhelm Reet, when women have always been waiting for men from far away. Their family friend Mart loves Reet and cannot see her suffer. It is in Marti's power to offer Reet a safe life, and the woman plagued by internal struggles makes a choice, but happiness seems to slip even further away.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c0yJPm4FfXy38JBtACDAv0Ax2Cl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1973-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
