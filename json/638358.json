He wrote a good part of his work in these houses where he lived until 1973. The houses are closely associated with the poet's friendship with the Catalan architect Germán Rodríguez Arias. Arias was hired to design most of the poet's architectural follies. This film explores the history of these houses which the poet and the architect erected together, in two different esthetic styles: on the one hand, an irrational Nerudan world, and on the other Bauhaus lines and rationalism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isla Negra, Illa Blanca","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
