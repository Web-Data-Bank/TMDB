Name-calling and cruel language hurt, say the teens who speak in this video. Homophobic language is a common verbal put-down among young people, but many adults feel uncomfortable responding. This video is a tool for teachers, counsellors and youth groups to explore the origins of the words, how young people feel about them and how to overcome the pain they cause.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cBwha7BO3IKSrCb9GKjA2DcQSCw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Other Words","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
