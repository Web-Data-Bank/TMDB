In addition to demonstrating their talent, this film provides a look at their personal lives, lives that have always revolved around the magic of the carnival (Which lasts just a month per year), but that inevitably must make room for their daily life, far from show business and public recognition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qnQvJ8Uw0R5KfLmzubgfAilnNoW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coral Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2007-10-26","revenue":2906,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Matinée","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
