The path we drive leads to the heart of the Ettrick Forest, a dive into a textile world. A land where man, machinery and nature deal with a complex relationship that draws their future. Slipping through poetry, between the brutality of matter and the sublime landscape, we experience a penetrating vision that embodies the stability of our deep desire to live in peace. Spectators are aware of the impotence of our movements, and we know that nature will find its way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bMx4A3SNzpAdpSCdDgC3JYwoGoy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123972,"logo_path":null,"name":"Too Many Cowboys","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ettrick","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
