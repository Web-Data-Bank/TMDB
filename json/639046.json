The visual material is set against readings of extracts from diaries kept by soldiers from the two armies. The various sources – musical, cinematic, and autobiographical – are combined to create a unique emotional experience, which simultaneously recounts the war, sheds light on propaganda techniques, compares them with soldiers’ accounts, and puts a modern slant on the music of the time inspired by the war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/37pqiap1bfDnMB3OY4WnVsNE360.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes from the front: music, words and images of the great war","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
