Tribes on the Edge has grown into movement driven by a passionate effort to enact tangible impact through campaign initiatives: Action, Communication and Education . More than a narrative of reality in the Amazon, Tribes on the Edge suggests the universal story of our human tribe and how our future is interwoven with each other and with nature. This is a story that invokes the critical importance of respect and care – for land, culture, and humanity. Our survival may depend on it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zkhHnS3iqDyjFsfKWO8PcddPYx4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Their survival could mean ours.","title":"Tribes on the Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
