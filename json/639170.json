One morning Mary discovers a burst pipe under the kitchen sink. Rather than dealing to the problem, the family ignore the leak, preferring to follow their banal daily lives, including their anticipation of a rugby game versus France that night.  The leak continues and slowly the house floods. A black comedy of surreal proportions, Water is a film about procrastination, denial and global warming. How one small problem, when ignored, can lead to disastrous consequences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
