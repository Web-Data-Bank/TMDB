It is about fame and our culture of obsession. Actor Darren McWarren (Jason Gann) starred in soap, mini-series and film before destroying his career with a series of indiscretions. Now McWarren is out of the industry and living in a small town in Western Victoria he can do whatever he wants. When a journalist decides to write a \"Where are they now\" profile on McWarren, he finds the former star has become a modern day Errol Flynn. The local girls want to fornicate with him and their fellas want to fight him. He mightn't have found love - but it's the next best thing.","popularity":0.986,"poster_path":"/r5wkNytf7CzO16prJ1P5774FTOh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Never meet your heroes.","title":"Rats and Cats","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
