The book received noteriety from 1978-1982 during the rise of Reagan republicanism and the emergence of punk rock. In Parnes’ interpretation, each video-chapter presents a typical scene in the life of Janie bracketed by US news events from the time period in which the book was written. These events saturate the character's daily experience, informing her adolescent, nihilistic worldview and her desire for rebellion. As the viewer looks back at pivotal historical events (Jonestown Massacre, Moral Majority, Three Mile Island etc.) connections are drawn in relation to our current political situation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m6EC68QvM1WkgsWRmYSgGIscr5m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood and Guts in High School","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
