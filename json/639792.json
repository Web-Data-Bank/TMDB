The stories and perspectives of four Village members are woven together to illustrate a place unlike any other; a community enlightened by ancient scripture and determined to prioritize 'life' in its purest form. The polygamous and vegan practices of the African Hebrew Israelites are just a few unique elements embedded in their foundation, principles, and daily lifestyle. Ultimately we are shown a place remarkable in its beauty and purity, though uncertain in its future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yB115oRIf5ya1SrVjE1LpGcOVfP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Village Of Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
