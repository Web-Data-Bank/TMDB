The shadows of the past soon overwhelm her, but life in prison transformed Valya into a determined fighter for the love she has for Paz, a young Peruvian woman from Cuzco, who during Valya's incarceration felt compelled into a fictitious marriage of convenience to calm the punishing waters swirling around the presence of the supposed demon Valya in Paz' ultraconservative family. Only Andean magic can help the two lovers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1oNfzdHgYnk5R21j4kk6zQv0fRK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supay","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
