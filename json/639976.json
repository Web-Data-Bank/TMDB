Capturing both the tantalising promise and the repeated disappointments of this singular technology, the film reveals how the post-war, romantic fantasy of an Atom-powered future developed into the stormy, on-off relationship still playing out today. A tale of scientific passion and political intrigue all wrapped up in the packaging of a sentimental screen melodrama.","popularity":1.507,"poster_path":"/j2Izvb6ipmgvQIGAW67uq5IabDG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Atom: A Love Affair","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2}
