These include the ’50s drive-in where moviegoers could drop off their dirty laundry and pick it up after the show, horror filmmaker William Castle’s vibrating seats and producer Sam Arkoff’s offer to pay for the funeral of anyone scared to death by his film. Amusing interviews with critic Roger Ebert and director John Waters, creator of Smell-O-Vision, enliven a program that has one central failing: host Frankie Avalon, who remains as schlocky as ever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1U54TQVPWYwZeMMlcngXnYkAQ9r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beehive Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":10914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Jones Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":130084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tele Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":130085,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video-Pack Systems","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ballyhoo: The Hollywood Sideshow!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
