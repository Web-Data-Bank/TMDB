However, the filmmaker is more concerned with how ownership issues reverberate amongst nationalists in competing countries rather than in the history of the dispute or its resolution, making it possible to present the patriotic pathos-soaked ceremonies of the Japanese, the efforts of Chinese authorities to complicate diversionary activities, and the expressive protests and bizarre rituals of Taiwanese activists. The desire to understand the situation leads the director to participate in several futile attempts to land on the islands. Although he finds himself on the frontline during an escalation in the conflict, he is able to maintain his distance as an impartial observer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AvjEbPiNisd8D7f8qHe1z5Gv6lP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terra Nullius or: How to Be a Nationalist","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
