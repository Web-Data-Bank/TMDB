Although most people know of the red devil he painted on the rock face of the legendary Schöllenen Gorge, the artist has remained relatively unknown to the public. Primarily based on Danioth’s diaries and letters, the film portrays the life story of an artist lapsed into undeserved obscurity. Together with contemporary witnesses still alive today (including his two daughters), the filmmaker reconstructs the artist’s life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fdJoN3OVySWzw107b7QwancUoPd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2015-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Danioth - Der Teufelsmaler","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
