It portrays the relationship between people and birds.  Hoarse from shouting, tired from running, man eventually thought that the invention of the scarecrow would demonstrate his domination over birds. But the scare soon turned sour and the rag doll became little more than a symbol of the battle between man and bird.  Geese in the meadow, sparrows in a glass house, pigeons in the city, starlings on an airport runway - the birds are everywhere. This grotesque story of too many birds and too many people competing for space and resources in a small country makes for a brilliant and very funny film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tE9NJMAMkZq9JJfU9zbyjo8oZHd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruim Kader Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Man battles BIRD!","title":"Scary Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
