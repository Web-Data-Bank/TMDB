The three muscular hunks lounge by the fire, watching for signs of the mythical figure, but when Oliver takes off into the night things take a turn. Left alone, Beaux and Pierce can't contain their long-brewing lust, and soon Beaux discovers that whether Big Cock is fact or fiction, the monster in Pierce's pants is the real thing. After a wild night hunting for Big Cock, Pierce Paris finds Oliver shaken but safe. Beaux takes Oliver back to civilization, leaving Pierce to collect his breath and get some much needed rest. However, while the muscular stud is alone in the tent, the legendary Big Cock shows up and pulls him out into the forest. Oliver Dean comes back to the campsite to find Beaux Banks and Pierce Paris spent from their night of intensity. They shoo him away, but soon they're visited by another unwelcome visitor, the mythical Big Cock!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qPxJfdtDv1nMMfdZsCtLJeoGF7l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53581,"logo_path":"/4DB5CFKeeoKMBN9KiZtqFKAq8FE.png","name":"MEN","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legend Of Big Cock","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
