But before the stripping can commence, the men have to get to work, because the club turns out to be a construction nightmare. Soon they find themselves in the grips of real-estate king Pablo, who also turns out to be a competitor in the love department. Jorrit falls deeply for the attractive and free-spirited Lola , a Dutch woman settled in Miami, who is also a stripper and who counts Pablo as one of her suitors. Jorrit will have to find out where the boundaries of seduction and freedom lie in their work. Meanwhile, an ego clash between Bas and Jorrit leads to a disastrous opening of their club.
