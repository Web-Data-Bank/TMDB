It culminated in an album released worldwide on October 11, 2005, entitled The All-Star Sessions. Four \"team captains\" were chosen to lead 57 artists from 45 past and present Roadrunner bands, and produce and oversee the album's 18 tracks: Joey Jordison of Slipknot and Murderdolls; Matt Heafy of Trivium; Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, Asesino and Divine Heresy and formerly of Brujeria; and Robert Flynn of Machine Head and formerly of Vio-lence and Forbidden. The unprecedented project was the brainchild of Roadrunner UK General Manager Mark Palmer and Roadrunner USA VP of A&amp;R Monte Conner.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/xPdjojibj1KA3b4flcKpG8XUDg2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadrunner Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Metal concert to end all metal concert","title":"Roadrunner United: The Concert","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
