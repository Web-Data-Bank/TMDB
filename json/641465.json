Since the early 70's, she photographer has been working in her apartment near the Porte Dorée, in Paris, principally with the female body. Scraps from the past and elements of the present come together to evoke the coherence and multiple meanings of Irina's baroque universe : the solitude of her Romanian childhood ; her youthful debut in the music hall ; her relationships with her models and her way of building images. Little by little, her work is illuminated and takes on different vibrations, though we have never left the apartment : her workspace, temple and museum.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/rlu0jpBggcDOxjV4zF6UQNrJTDS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87450,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Maison du doc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Irina Ionesco - Nocturnes Porte Dorée","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
