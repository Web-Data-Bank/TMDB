The original home movie was shot in the Palace Sans Souci in early spring, 1931 by an unknown Japanese amateur cineaste. I got this film unexpectedly. But if not, this film had never remained in film history. When we saw this film carefully, we could be found out the sensibility and aesthetics of the Japanese of pre-war days.Accurate operation of camera, delicacy, moderation and a bit of sadness. And we could also notice that he had been seeing a scene of Japan in a foreign country.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yl65nSRySOzJnazns9IsrR433fn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finally, Spring Has Come","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
