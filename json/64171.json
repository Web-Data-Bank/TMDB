It aired on CBS-TV from 1969â€“1971 before a 20-year run in local syndication. The show was inspired by Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In,[1] the major difference being that Hee Haw was far less topical, and was centered on country music. Initially co-hosted by musicians Buck Owens and Roy Clark, the show was equally well-known for its voluptuous, scantily-clad women in stereotypical farmer's daughter outfits, male stars Jim and Jon Hager and its cornpone humor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s0ElzsGdIy1kUm3Kd5p4weqG2sJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hee Haw","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
