This leads to festivities including the breaking of the piñata, which in turn leads to Donald Duck trying to break his own piñata as well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pDolssYsnkgukNwSz8Hxk7ZDOt8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las Posadas","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
