Given the freedom to wander the set as they pleased, the Lebon’s received unrestricted access and a privileged insight into the filmmaking process of Korine - a long time inspiration for both brothers. They came home with thousands of photographs and 50+ hours of footage which was edited down over the course of the intervening year, and has resulted in two distinct pieces of collaborative work - a twenty-minute film and a limited-edition photographic book titled 'Inside the Bum'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yVkVjVu9hgnLNLlaXEn3I20Lqay.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38060,"logo_path":null,"name":"DoBeDo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside the Bum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
