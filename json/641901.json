The narrator of the film is constantly communicating with the viewer, exclaims and inserts jokes, and we also see him in the film as a guide entertaining us with various gestures and movements. In the film there are also interspersed humorous animated scenes, an interview with Hamlet, poetic sequences and stylized scenes such as one where the camera is \"looking for\" the lost guide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zagreb Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beauty of the Adriatic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
