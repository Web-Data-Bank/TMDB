When hubby suddenly drops dead, however, Natalija’s narrow life of cows and rails finally starts opening up. Dumping his body at the local hospital, dropping by church to say a few prayers and trading in the cow for a pet goat, she slowly eliminates all trace of his former hold on her, searching out a new life in the freedom that emerges.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fn3SPCyA25PwbU8TQC7l6u0e2qS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85254,"logo_path":"/y7GUyTtDYxkLHe9iabX2HlsQ9Ty.png","name":"Studio SLON","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":8548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradise Production Center","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2007-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travelling with Pets","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":11}
