Aside from formal issues, Yvonne Rainerâ€™s knotty process of thinking, her unique brand of humor, and her engaging presence are the things that were foremost in my mind as I worked on the tape. What I hope will emerge from this process is an interrogative portrait of an artist for whom I have great respect and affection.\"  --Charles Atlas","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rainer Variations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
