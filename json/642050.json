The dance consisted initially of a 5-minute sequence of movement that would eventually be presented as The Mind is a Muscle, Part I at Judson Church on January 10, 1966. There it was performed by me, David Gordon, and Steve Paxton simultaneously but not in unison. In an interim version of The Mind is a Muscle (Judson Church, May 22, 1966), it was performed by William Davis, David Gordon, and Steve Paxton. In the final section, called Lecture, Peter Saul executed a balletic solo version, i.e. with pirouettes and jumps. In the final version (Anderson Theater, April 11, 1968), Trio A was performed by me in tap shoes in its original version at the end of the evening, while Paxton, Gordon, and Davis performed it as a trio at the beginning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m8WIW7ELPiHlpsTZtPtkHuW36rb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trio A","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
