To say goodbye to the carefree days, they invite three best friends on vacation to a paradise beach. On the way their car breaks down and the distance to the hotel is far. In this secluded place there is no public transport, the mobile phones do not get a connection. Finally, there is no choice for them except to stay at a decrepit bungalow on the beach. Finding a rotting body in the house is not a good way to start the evening - but worse is about to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iY1Kh5BzefphMK4vTSxU5dfsGYi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173473,"logo_path":null,"name":"Besinema","origin_country":""},{"id":173474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Project 711 Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2010-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pengantin Topeng","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
