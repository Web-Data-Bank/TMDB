Returning to it years after initial production debacles, Berlioz stated that he would 'never again find such verve and Cellinian impetuosity, nor such a variety of ideas.' The plot revolves around Cellini's wooing of Teresa, a match frustrated at every opportunity by his rival, the cowardly Fieramosca. Benvenuto Cellini is a pithy work combining romance, excitement, violence, comedy and spectacle; the perfect stage for Terry Gilliam's stylishly colorful and larger than life directing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iKVZ9drTxk5ggoirf3cXfTvnEMv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77605,"logo_path":null,"name":"NAXOS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"GRAMOPHONE CLASSICAL MUSIC AWARDS 2019 SHORTLIST - OPERA","title":"Benvenuto Cellini","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
