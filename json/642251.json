Basing the narrative on eye-witness accounts, the artists use G.I. Joe action figures, similar to those they played with during childhood, to tell the story. The video examines a culture in which young boys are encouraged to act out such violent scenarios before they can even read. More generally, it is critical of America’s unquenchable thirst for material goods.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/288R5MejZ1RClxYJZzB9mxd2c6J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter In America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
