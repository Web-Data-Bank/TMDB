The film was made in the 2005 PC game \"The Movies,\" a business simulation game that allowed users to create their own films using pre-rendered scenes and tells the story of three Moroccan immigrants in France who turn to rioting after facing different forms of discrimination. The film was made as a response to the 2005 French riots which resulted from the deaths of two young boys who were electrocuted while hiding from police in a power substation. The civil unrest called attention to racism in France and abusive policing tactics. On its release, The French Democracy sparked controversy in mainstream media both as a political statement and as an example of the then-emerging Machinima genre tackling mature, political themes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1vMyFRouXPTZqSxGy4C2ewhWWG4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The French Democracy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
