The delirious short takes place in a far future equal parts Blade Runner and Bruegel the Elder, full of tough-talking gangsters, jaw-dropping neon vistas, and enough bizarre creatures and robots to fill several Star Wars cantinas. The world-building illustrates the animatorâ€™s philosophy that movies can be as much about their setting as they are their characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x7XBqkkI78eHkry7kgty1JLoKsw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye Mommy","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
