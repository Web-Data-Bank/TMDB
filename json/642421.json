There is no explaining a gift like Leonard Bernstein, a true legend and one of the truly great ones of the 20th century (and a great Brahms conductor!). I have followed his career and recordings both at the NY Philharmonic and at Vienna (other places too). His brilliance and incandescence are revelatory in these Brahms performances. His view of a thorough-going romantic Brahms expressing his passionate control of an inner rage in classical form is convincing. He and this great Vienna orchestra give a consistent statement of it. And, of course, Bernstein's introductory comments are without peer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/adWWzTB2bGuAZBNdgTM9KifWcnF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":235,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Towering Performances!","title":"Bernstein Brahms Symphonies","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
