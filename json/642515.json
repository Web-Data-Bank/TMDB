His approach is characterized by a full bodied sound throughout a wide dynamic range, complete virtuosity and a structural sense that gives clarity to both local and global musical events.  His tempo choices make sense within a complete movement or entire sonata (he doesn't need to slow down dramatically for the second subject in Op.53's first movement) and he will mostly maintain a tempo with only slight fluctuations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nlEMHC1mDafgZK4uE69Pvocy5wu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A lovely musical and visual document","title":"Emil Gilels Recital","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
