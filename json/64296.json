Daniel lives with his grandmother and, after one year of high school, has to go to live with his mother in the south of France. She is a seamstress living in a tiny apartment with her lover Jose, a Spanish farm worker. Daniel would like to continue school, but his mother cannot afford it, so she sends him to work as an apprentice in a moped repair shop. Daniel wiles away his time in the shop, and learns about girls from the other boys in town. When he returns to visit his grandmother next year, it is obvious that he has grown up faster than his old friends.","popularity":3.606,"poster_path":"/nueQTPSsCorjhKYavTuUDCruhGG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elite Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1974-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Little Loves","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":26}
