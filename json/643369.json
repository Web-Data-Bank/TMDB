The men who come in are a catalog of gay male fantasies. The strong businessman, the well hung construction worker, the horny electrician, the sleazy young art student, the pushy biker and the wild punk. There is always a danger of being caught that makes it all the more exciting to do it there. For his first porn movie Todd Verow recaptures that world. A young man, Marcel, has a job working in an art gallery in Berlin. There is an exhibit of gay erotic art up that includes a live statue of a man fisting himself. Marcel spends his days in the gallery daydreaming about the hot guys who come and go. He sees them having hot, wild sex, other times he imagines it. When he gets involved he wants them to cum on him, leaving their mark, like signing the guest book. In the end Marcel has sex with the living statue which sets him free but Marcel must take his place. 120 minutes of sleazy hot sex in the utmost quality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/orccYvd1oXwTvLyEGlHh1GWsFEL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wurstfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where art meets homo eroticism and hot gay sex!","title":"Fucking Art","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
