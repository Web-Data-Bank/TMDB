He lives with his grandmother. He keeps her at an arm’s length, and so, when she has a sudden stroke, he ignores her call, and doesn’t find out until he reads a text message sent from Wellington Hospital.  He rushes to the hospital, in the middle of the night, drunk and hopped up on cheap stimulants. He is greeted by a closed door, and a nurse who tells him he has to wait to see his grandma. Thus, Liam spends a night and a morning in the hospital, contemplating his decisions, while befriending a young boy who is waiting for news of his mother. A social-realist drama, Boxes is a story about regret, relationships, and the widespread existence of small tragedies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mui8xYB6AYSYzseUCzbZxR4ch9g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When a teenage boy’s grandmother falls suddenly ill, he finds himself contemplating their relationship, and whether he did as much as he could to be close to her.","title":"Boxes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
