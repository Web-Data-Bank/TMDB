When Mickey, his cop friend, is being shot, he leaves everything to find the murderers. Two years before, Marx, an old gambler, met Frederic, a young man that does not look very smart and started to follow him everywhere (as a puppy) and changed his name to Johnny to please Marx. Of course, Simon's story is related with Marx and Johnny's one. But the thriller is only a pretext for a psychological description of the three main characters.","popularity":3.759,"poster_path":"/s4kAQLqnHxPmS5GrKRxIsEUfDaf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bloody Mary Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See How They Fall","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":38}
