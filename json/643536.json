His performances are exemplary in every respect. The video and audio are quite acceptable, given their 1970s vintage. BÃ¶hm and Abbado are at home in this repertoire, and the Wiener Philharmoniker in excellent form, notwithstanding a few strange noises coming from the horns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fkQ6ODOmxJYkA6RuuSZibdvEAZL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven, Mozart & Brahms Piano Concertos","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
