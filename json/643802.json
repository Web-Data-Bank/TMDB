He strives to participate in litigation, but always hits a wall. One day, he finally received a civil claim suit, but did not expect that the defense lawyer in this case was actually Zhao Dingbang (Ban Tiexiang), the boss of his law firm. If he helped the plaintiff, how should he face his boss? What is more difficult is that this case is not a general lawsuit. It is actually a multinational class action with 531 plaintiffs. Li Zhenghong has not even fought a single lawsuit, and is a blind person. How should he win the lawsuit?","popularity":1.177,"poster_path":"/62RYaQPv33Mi9m06P5jEiF5No7m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2019-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible Justice","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
