The scenes in Australia were if anything more riotous than in the US. When the Beatles arrived in Adelaide, something like half the population lined a motorcade from the airport to their hotel!  I think this is one of the best filmed Beatles performances. Unlike Shea, the sound has not been ‘doctored’ – ie there have been no overdubs made, yet the Beatles sound great! For me, You Can’t Do That and Long Tall Sally are the stand out songs.  I especially love the end of Long Tall Sally, when a guy looking exactly like John Lennon, manages to get on stage, and shakes John’s hand in the middle of the song!!  Hopefully, in the not too distant future, we will get an official DVD of The Beatles full concert performances. If we do, this show must be included.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4EQnndExNSrfy3LqVHVJWnl0t3m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beatles Live in Melbourne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
