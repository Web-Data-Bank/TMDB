All of them were very lucky to have faithful and devoted friends. But the seventh grader Kirill is keenly aware of the lack of friendship in his class.  He especially felt this when he was accused of stealing a wallet. Kirill himself found a thief — he turned out to be a quiet and defenseless Chirok, following the courtesy of yard hooligans. Taking Chirok under his protection, Kirill managed to fend for himself and his new friend.","popularity":0.936,"poster_path":"/zJGN41FqqNNwS5MITBqVnv6URp5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21978,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1982-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lullaby for Brother","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
