The central theme is the unknown or the “other” and our efforts as individual humans to understand our place and relationship with the unknowable.  There are several subjects woven into the film.  These are: facial expressions of human and non-human primates; space training and missions of chimpanzees; human study of monkeys (symbolized by the image of Jane Goodall); interactions between humans and animals (taken from news reports); lumps-- organisms that wash up on beaches that fit no known life forms (also called globsters); and, extra-terrestrials.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monkeys and Lumps","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
