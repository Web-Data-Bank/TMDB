It is almost a meditation about the question whether a final act like murder can be atoned for in a temporal order – and whether the passing of time allows the victim’s family to forgive. Mickevičius uses the example of two lifers (one of them gets married and wants to have children, the other pours his whole passion into an idea of craftsmanship) and a philosopher with prison experience to make that strange state of suspended life comprehensible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1X50ARnbdoBwxMrBQZOUPY1lUYE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agitprop","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":109104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casablanca Film Production (SI)","origin_country":""},{"id":96786,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stefilm","origin_country":""},{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":126552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Era Film","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2019-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exemplary Behaviour","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
