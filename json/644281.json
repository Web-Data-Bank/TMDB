Regional pre-teen beauty pageants, big-budget Vietnamese karaoke videos, altar boy training tapes, a home movie labelled \"bonion sergery,\" and Pudgie Wudgie the Wondercat all get their place in the sun. Plus, for the first time, Joe and Nick tell the definitive story behind their local morning news prank journey, including the humiliating footage from their legal depositions after getting sued in federal court. It's a cringe-worthy celebration you won't want to miss. Recorded live at The North Door in Austin, TX.","popularity":0.853,"poster_path":"/tukTFmALqKuFMK5eKYsTH9nxSce.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Found Footage Festival Volume 9","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
