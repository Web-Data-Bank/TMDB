Gould's clear, analytical manner of speech delivers a stream of pointed observations, dry jokes, and childhood memories, revealing his nuanced lifelong relationship with the city: not the simple one of a booster, nor the even simpler one of a detractor. But then, Gould never had anything simple about him â€” nor, as I've come to find out this past week, does Toronto.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Qu5hs8cvXkFkIi3bTO4Tcou3Wn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glenn Gould's Toronto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
