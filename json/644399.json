Much has changed, and since he arrives on January 6, 2011, just as major riots break out in Algiers, he finds his own questions and concerns echoed in the demonstrations and gatherings—both public and private—to which he brings his camera. Ammar-Khodja's chronological diary-film is intimate, immediate, visceral—and unexpectedly funny. The film documents not only the recent political past of the country, but also the psychological difficulties of \"going home again.\" Ammar-Khodja's mix of genres, grand flourishes, and stylistic touches identifies him as a questioning, searching soul and a talented filmmaker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ask Your Shadow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
