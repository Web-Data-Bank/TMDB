The race came one week after the Tour of Flanders, with World Champion Tom Boonen riding high on his victory. George Hincapie also had a strong finish on the podium in Flanders, and came to Paris-Roubaix in top-notch form with a killer drive to win and a strong team to support him. Hincapie has wanted to add a win at Paris-Roubaix to his palmares for years, but things don't always turn out though. Hincapie's race ended up being very memorable, but unfortunately not in the way he wanted it to. The field was both strong and deep. Apart from Boonen and Hincapie, other strong riders including Peter Van Petegem (Davitamon), Fabian Cancellara (CSC), Juan Antonio Flecha (Rabobank), Steffen Wesemann (T-Mobile) animate the action.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1m2YOzslCIqjbe8xs9veA1bDdC5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Against All Odds","title":"2006 Paris Roubaix","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
