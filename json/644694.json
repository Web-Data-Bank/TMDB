Recording throughout the South and in New York, he amassed footage that reflects the American experience. Country roads, gravestones and small-town main streets seen from a car window gradually give way to an ominous vision — saturated by Gorewitz's signature image-processing techniques and lurid, fluorescent colors — of an America dominated by industry and the military. Called a \"tour-de-force\" by The New York Times, this is a propulsive, kinetic work of rich visual and aural textures. -EAI","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ahSnYJ3oFu8L0zLlfbqqGZcnnJ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"U.S. Sweat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
