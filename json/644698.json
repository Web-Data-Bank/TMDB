The audio of this performance was recorded on CD with music by David J and Tim Perkins.  In 1993, a graphic novel adaptation of \"The Birth Caul\" was published.  This video combines the audio and visuals of \"The Birth Caul\" to create a unique metaphysical experience.  Hopefully this captures the spirit and the magick of this performance in a manner evoked by Alan Moore on that night.  Please experience this video as a tribute to the creators of this art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5vdAiafMxFyLIpZ9LrJ4U0nASfX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Birth Caul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
