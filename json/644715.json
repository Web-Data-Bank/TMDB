This film is inspired by the Native American dance performed especially in the 1890s to encourage renewal and prosperity – or from another point of view, to drive out the white man and bring back the buffalo. This is a meditative landscape piece, set between a eulogy for an unspoken past and a plea for attention to an unmapped future …  Music is an original work called LENS, written and performed by composer/ cellist Ha-Yang Kim.\" - Holly Fisher","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2VaJjhqBEsRYGzsrpJDeIpMTuzi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost Dance for a New Century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
