The photographs are animated through a re-filming process to create a flow of moving images that are intercut with passages from the movie. Iconic actress Jeanne Moreau, using a text by American poet Kimiko Hahn, narrates the diary-like fragments of memories and recollections in the first person. The haunting music by Lois V Vierk accentuates the fleeting quality of these fragments of dreams and memories.” — Jon Gartenberg","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vX8LxJ4NgIMPCFZBYtgC6MDBlnn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everywhere at Once","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
