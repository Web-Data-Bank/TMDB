Whereas The Pain Factory predominantly revolved around experimental music performances, Fuck TV was a comprehensive and experiential audio-visual presentation. Aired to a passive and unsuspecting audience on San Franciscoâ€™s public access channel from 1997 to 1998, each episode of Fuck TV was dedicated to a specific topic, combining video collage and cut-up techniques set to a harsh electronic soundtrack. The resultant overload of processed imagery and visceral sound was unlike anything presented on television before or since.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jYt6l9hGmZlAWFYoeC9GT5JdWmU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FUCK TV: Yule Bible","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
