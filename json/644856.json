Only one fortified town lies in their way, but its Croatian commander and small garrison of men are determined to stand their ground.  Ivan Zajc’s patriotic opera retells the story of Nikola Šubić Zrinjski’s daring leadership and heroic sacrifice during the real life Siege of Siget. Packed with powerful music – including the rousing male chorus ‘U boj, u boj!’ – it has held a treasured place in the Croatian repertoire ever since its wildly successful premiere in 1876.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5OWCAhD1zYvUlCaOY8gVDeodtLY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nikola Šubić Zrinjski","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
