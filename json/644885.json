Itâ€™s a time not far from the dawn of the moving image, the obsessed and wealthy Dr. Epstein engineers a number of scientific experiments. He subjects his adopted children, Pete and Re-Pete, along with his darling flapper, Baby Dee, to his various scientific tasks. Things take a decidedly strange turn when Epstein makes a deal with some shifty-looking vagabonds. On doing so he opens a door to the unknown, ruptures the fabric of time and unleashes a shadow-like character bent on reducing all those he encounters to dust.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3JDmZDJrJuTU99MKV8vWH9752JI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Experimental Film Society","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2019-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autumnal Sleeps","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
