With music rooted in Bebop with a progressive slant, the Jazz legend was a session player for King Records and released his first album as a bandleader — The First Time (with a quartet that included pianist Pat Kelly) — in 1979. McGary’s spirit and legacy have lived on well after his passing and well beyond Cincinnati, as evidenced in this new documentary film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ecfRi7y6hRUQYrjui6XdYzA8k3M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ancient Actions Music Art \u0026 Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jimmy McGary: The Best Jazz You Never Heard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
