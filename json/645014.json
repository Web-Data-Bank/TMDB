The viewer undertakes a journey into their own interior world of dreams and projections in which time and space, and cause and effect logic, are turned on their heads. Text Messages from the Universe is inspired by The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a text which guides souls on their journey of 49 days through the 'Bardo', or intermediate state, between dying and rebirth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6ctifNsUG5FBUfoGGolE2acYC19.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109331,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Physical TV Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Text Messages from the Universe","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
