No one else could prove or explain the odd phenomenon, but it becomes the pivotal event for three young people in this long-awaited return to form for director Patrick Leung (La Brassiere, Simply Actors). This charming sci-fi comedy also marks the reunion of Tsui Tien-you, Wong Younam and Charlene Choi, who co-starred in 2002 teen comedy hit Summer Breeze of Love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qIrbprGedVYaL9lXvcsFzVgq31U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184349,"logo_path":null,"name":"Icon Group Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2019-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ciao UFO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
