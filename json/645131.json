Between those landmarks she performed the role nearly 100 times all over the world and made studio audio recordings that became reference recordings for the role. This 1962 production with the Deutsche Oper Berlin and Giuseppe Patane was planned as a media event from the outset and blessedly captures a consummate artist in a signature role at the peak of her gifts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7pfxoQ8ubcCLEgC3b0lF0PHAQRC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1962-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Glorious portrait of Renata Tebaldi","title":"Verdi Otello","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
