According to most sources, Cuban civil society is limited to the opposition, which has little impact on the Cuban political scenario. Regardless, yearly, the U.S. government allocates tens of millions of taxpayer money to empower dissidents in the island. By doing so, it overlooks genuine expressions of pluralism, reform and contestation which are shaping the Cuban public sphere, sometimes in autonomous ways, sometimes within State-run institutions. Through in-depth interviews to members of Cuban Civil society, this documentary explores the complexities associated to these processes, following the itinerary of the debate about the concept of civil society generated in Cuba, since the 90s to the present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p6hMXMYiuQaENoFqsXBzh7TIKsf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Icarus Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Something deeper than the truth","title":"Rethinking Cuban Civil Society","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
