Of particular importance was the question of how something cinematic may move from a state of \"pure horizontality\" to that of \"pure verticality,\" which, for Leckey, was analogous to asking how a cinematic image may become an object, sculpture, monument or \"beast.\" James Cameron's Titanic was one of many exemplars of this process, described by Leckey as a \"time-travel film\" that compressed \"the bookends of the 20th century\" (the materiality of early industrial manufacturing, the immateriality of late software production and 3D design) and torqued this resulting hybrid around one deceptively small iceberg.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema in the Round","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
