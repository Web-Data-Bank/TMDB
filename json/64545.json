The story bears traces of the Bertold Brecht-Weill piece The Threepenny Opera, with heroine Lilac (Marcelle Romeo) consorting with the criminal scum of Paris. Lilac falls in love with a handsome detective (Andre Luguet), but he doesn't let his emotions stand in the way of his duty, and in the end he reluctantly turns her over to the authorities. At $120,000, Coeur de Lilas was one of the most expensive movies to come out of France in 1931, but it more than made back its cost at the box-office.","popularity":1.186,"poster_path":"/8lDfcvkJEYjMmzgnPQhjC78qTKS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129465,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fifra","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1932-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lilac","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
