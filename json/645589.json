We see old women, we see the countryside and we see the city. There are fragments of old stories, there is an attempt (not always achieved) to connect the old themes of the field with the original songs of Fachada and there is a fragile (and welcome) humanity that runs throughout the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dtk8kzDLQu8KWTFQgyEPWeagmze.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2009-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"B Fachada: Tradição Oral Contemporânea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
