Romy has chosen former circus performers, mimes, and actors from street theater -- most of them in their first-time film roles -- to interpret these diverse and off-the-wall couples/couplings. One young mute woman finds her voice through a ventriloquist, another falls in love with a trapeze artist, and a village idiot finds a unique way to experience his first intimate sexual encounter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iGslr8Hc4saR5UEJvkrSVfowLxQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le bar des amants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
