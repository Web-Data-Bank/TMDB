But it’s not that simple”, Christiane Hein states at the beginning of her film which follows seven-year-old Robert Becher from Erfurt in his struggle against excess pounds. The stages include a dieting sanatorium complete with “juice day”, humiliating physical education lessons at school and a visit to relatives in the country where Robert experiences a life without teasing and self-punishment. This is where the boy lets go – not easy when thoughts of weight fence one’s life in. Again and again, director Hein inserts scales as a symbolic image reminiscent of a guillotine-like torture instrument. A compassionate portrait.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Because I’m Fat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
