The show combined the residual energy of Halloween with a tropical feel that could only have happened in South Florida in November. Amidst swaying palms and soft breezes, the band played a deeply experimental show. They were joined by percussionist Karl Perazzo (Santana), whose contribution helped extend and build upon the magic of Halloween, adding polyrhythms that explored new space within Phish's music.Set 1: Ya Mar[1], Julius[1], Fee[2] -> Taste[1], Cavern[1] > Stash[1], The Lizards[1], Free[1], Johnny B.
