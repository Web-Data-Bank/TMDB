How can you think about the future if all that you see through the window are barbed wires, armoured vehicles and tanks? Aleksey from Nagorno-Karabakh, Timur from Ukraine, and Alexander from Georgia are facing these questions every day. These three men differ in almost every aspect of their lives, but in fact, each of them experiences the same consequences for their very existence. Each one of them experiences war. We observe people involved in the already forgotten border conflicts, that happened after the USSR collapse, and are still alive due to the Russian imperial policy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vMopTAlRHXN0SurhH5xJ0BwsPuF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kadr Film","origin_country":"IR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadows Of The Empire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
