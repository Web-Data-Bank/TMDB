It follows the story of 'Pep' who becomes a local hero after taking the law into his own hands to prevent a crime. Relishing in his new found glory, Pep joins the neighbourhood watch to further his agenda and fulfil his dream of creating a utopia; a town free of crime and antisocial behaviour. Before long, the extremity of Pep's measures and his aggressive and violent approach to achieving his goals becomes unacceptable to the local community and he is shunned. Desperate to regain his hero status, the rumour of a paedophile gives Pep one last chance to save the day; a manhunt ensues.","popularity":0.759,"poster_path":"/AmVwh8Vjj73bQlJiPvqZjrOOUDL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88615,"logo_path":"/mTNLbswxsrZw56OBiXMmsp28EV1.png","name":"Evolutionary Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Big trouble in little England","title":"Small Town Hero","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
