But for a spurned Spartan princess, there are only two options left: forgiveness and murder.  The most ambitious and innovative of all Rossiniâ€™s operas, Ermione was a calamitous failure on its opening night at the Teatro di San Carlo 200 years ago. It now returns to the Neapolitan theatre in a new production by Italian director Jacopo Spirei starring American soprano Angela Meade in the title role.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3Iq6SdzmxW5Aw9gDMWVOQkvtQFy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ermione - Rossini","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
