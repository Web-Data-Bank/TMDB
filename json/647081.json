Over the course of journey we get insights into her aspirations and dreams and are reminded of the sheer joy that physical playfulness in childhood can bring. Raja finds an unexpected challenge on her return - just one of endless variations of the same journey that she repeats day in, day out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qrKKyuylG7kPpwIRlK8Iw4LjHMU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Raja","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
