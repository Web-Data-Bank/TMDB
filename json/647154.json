From the street, The Weinstein House is an almost blind façade, covered in stone, from which an abstract bow window protrudes. This window, along with the house’s deep-set entrance, adds a central touch of colour and mystery to the composition. Shaped as an “L”, the house opens to a small backyard, thus creating a more private dialogue with the garden. The formal, yet paradoxically unconventional, plan of the house keeps us almost exclusively in the upper level, an exquisitely lit mazelike space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5zbhydyxsvTagVD1fUvYs85ImXG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125087,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruptura Silenciosa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2013-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Limpeza","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
