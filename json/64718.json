A band which folded twenty years ago (they were even considered old-fashioned then) sees fit to stage a comeback. Indications point to a great future until the ghosts of the past catch up with the band in the form of a single mother and a jolly roadie. We follow the band not only through the magnificent Icelandic landscape but also through two continents and a brief spell in the other world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m6aHygEjvBVoGhl629lUUJgEUbZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2004-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ahead of Time","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
