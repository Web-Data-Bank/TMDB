This venue, along with the gorgeous costumes, spectacular lighting, lasers and pyrotechnics made for one grand, five star production! This is reason enough to see it and it must be an advantage to view it on DVD.--It would probably be harder to digest the whole spectacle if you were actually sitting in the audience, as there is so much to take in.  The whole cast was in great form, both in singing and acting. Simon Yang as Zaccaria and Igor Morosow as Nabucco were excellent. Gabriella Morigi was a convincing Abigail who got better and better. Bruno Ribeiro as Ismaele and Elisabeth Kulman as Fenena were great, too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jjzzlXdDOdzrD3wS8O8ktWWKkvB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opernfestspiele St. Margarethen","origin_country":""},{"id":20005,"logo_path":null,"name":"DoRo Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":79658,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts Music International","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":132434,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medici Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2007-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nabucco","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
