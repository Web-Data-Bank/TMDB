A man who was spreading joy with his songs for sixty years, among several generations not only here, but also in Europe, and even worldwide. The singer traces the steps of his life, allows viewers to peek behind the scenes of concerts, and shows also his family life and privacy that he otherwise tries to lovingly and humbly protect.","popularity":0.901,"poster_path":"/lJjeTOCoYf8ceZcEGfQjN8O5hKE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52602,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bedna Films","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karel","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
