Having served time for two killings he swears not to have committed, Randall is now home, medicated and attempting to start a new life. But that proves difficult when the masked figure he sighted at the scene of the murders is back; a friend is in danger; and everyone seems to believe that he's the real threat in this chiller from Jack Thomas Smith.","popularity":1.247,"poster_path":"/s1wSab02tu761AHkoyV7s8NEWQe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disorder","video":false,"vote_average":3.3,"vote_count":3}
