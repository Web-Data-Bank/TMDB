They are connected to the rest of the world only by a thin thread of a narrow gauge railway winding through the gorges - and this is the only way from there and the only way there. A small old trolley - a motor-car, nicknamed by the locals \"Matrix\", delivers food, fuel and other benefits of civilization every day.
