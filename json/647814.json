The title of the work comes from the name given by Chileans to the religious altars erected on roadsides to mark the spot where an accident occurred. Tiny bells attached to long rods sway and tinkle in the wind. The artist produced three other \"Animitas\", in locations that are symbolic to him : the north of Quebec, the Dead Sea and the Island of Teshima.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":780,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animitas blanc","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
