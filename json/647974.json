Don Carlos is given in German, in the four act version with the usual cuts of that era and some extra cuts (the royal procession in the first scene is gone, the middle of the garden scene is gone, cuts are made in all the ensembles in the auto da fe scene, there is a snip -- not the biggest I've heard -- in the final Carlos/Elisabetta duet -- and finally the very end is rewritten by unknown hands -- the Grand Inquisitor grasps Carlos, Elisabetta faints (so no Friar, identification of the Friar as Charles V, and no final B flat.)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mxZUEQQSKrWM6g54j7rh0g9JDBf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Carlos","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
