Carly can't help but feel a little smitten by the handsome stranger, especially in contrast to her jerky boyfriend. The last thing she wants to do is go home right now and deal with James. Adam shrugs his shoulders and invites her to his friends house. The trio sits down in the living room and Carly nervously sips her drink, thinking that maybe she should just go home. Before she can say anything, Nathan is snapping photos of Adam and her on the couch to make his boyfriend freak. \"Now, kiss me\" Adam says. Carly hesitates, \"I think we've got enough good photos already!\" Nathan pushes her head towards his friend and reminds her that she needs to make her boyfriend jealous.","popularity":0.942,"poster_path":"/k4sktSs5xo71ibB465cgvQlR4k5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Samaritans","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
