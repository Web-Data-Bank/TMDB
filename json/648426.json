They know its nooks and crannies better than anyone, and have found a way to support themselves - and a dream - running a clandestine kitchen in an abandoned corner of the building. But times change: a new director arrives, spouting cynical speeches full of clichés with a fistful of empty promises. The kitchen is closed and a wave of redundancies disrupts the precarious equilibrium in the office, making everyday tasks a struggle for survival.","popularity":0.955,"poster_path":"/nYZI5lg6r4QwdHpq1hkUJ57En4E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2019-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lunchroom","video":false,"vote_average":6.706,"vote_count":17}
