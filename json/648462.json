To create \"349,\" a dance performance was videotaped and converted into a series of still frames. Over the span of two years, 349 different people each redrew one of these frames after being asked to \"draw yourself and someone with whom you have a significant connection.\" The resulting drawings were scanned, sequenced, and synced to music to create the short animated dance film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aGY9eAZglbxyzy9Zmv6O7rH2ljC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"349","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
