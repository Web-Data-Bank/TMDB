We watch as co-creators Rachel Bloom and Aline Brosh McKenna and their many talented collaborators steer the show through its final episode. The film highlights their unique process as they juggle writing, songwriting, choreography on a spinning turntable, last minute big ideas and emergencies, and the “impossible task” of creating a smart, feminist, musical comedy show that’s a process unlike any other show ever to air on network TV.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/6dUACjTdSDr0AiWlY3rjDgOGW15.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend: Oh My God I Think It's Over","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
