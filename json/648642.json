To hide the revolt and their murder of 250,000 Jews, the Nazis erased all trace of the camp. Now, Haimi, Mazurek, and local Poles excavate a forest to reveal irrefutable evidence, including traces of the walled corridor through which the Nazis herded Jews to the gas chamberâ€¦a Star of David, and a small name tag of a murdered child from Amsterdam. Adding eyewitness testimony is Philip Bialowitz, one of the 7 remaining Sobibor survivors.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deadly Deception at Sobibor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
