According to Byron, this is his second “musical.” The first of these “musicals” was Les Preludes. Opening scenes in To Joy interchange from gardens of yellow flowers to a revolving carousel to a woman in Asian-inspired attire that is spinning an umbrella. Other scenes include a woman belly dancing, as well as young girls dancing ballet and participating in a maypole dance. At one of the To Joy film screenings, Byron was asked who “Joy” is. -Chicago Film Archives","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e94mGutXWlzGYM6FO81fdAKKjpp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Joy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
