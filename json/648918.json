Built in the 1970s to protect essential government functions from nuclear strike, it is now a datacentre run by Bahnhof AB. The Pirate Bay & Wikileaks have both used Pionen for their colocation services, but the camera’s POV remains discreet on finer points like these, never fully disclosing the location it inhabits. Disclosure of a different kind reaches the viewer via a speed reading technology, which displays captions of the online postings of John Titor, (purported) time traveller from the year 2036.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9fxShiayoLw1dVD0ruRV6P3WKLY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colocation, Time Displacement","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
