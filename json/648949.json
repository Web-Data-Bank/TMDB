Rostropovich mastered the Schumann in several famous recordings. Here, conducted by Leonard Bernstein, he provides a splendid performance. Featuring his trademark powerful technique, smooth legato and crisp vibrato, the Romantic roots of the concerto are never hidden for long, despite the relatively cool playing of the Orchestre National de France.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/8rUkTa1umXQ9b8h0WEOUYOBizCb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rostropovich Life & Art","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
