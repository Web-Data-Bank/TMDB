It had been kept in the Syrian town of Aleppo for centuries and was smuggled in the 1950s to Israel, where it was revealed that 200 pages had gone missing. A cheese merchant, a murdered antiques dealer, Mossad agents and Israel’s second president are all implicated in the decades-long mystery. This gripping documentary is an attempt to find the lost pages as well as the soul of the once unified Aleppian Jewish community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Crown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
