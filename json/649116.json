Portugal and Spain, distant by fragments of their memories, images, objects, voices and ruins. Time runs out... An anxiety floats above the border and also a strength of believing that it is possible to change some things until the very last minute of our cross-over. In a world of contradictions, inequalities remain, existing surprising stories in almost forgotten lands. We are standing before a jigsaw puzzle organized into a map of ideas and memories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7hMLgE27MSMYq13aUz6o0zwWxNb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vo'Arte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"pt.es","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
