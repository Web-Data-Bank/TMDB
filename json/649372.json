A key fgure of the Argentine counterculture in the 60s, he played a similar role to those of Allen Ginsberg and Jonas Mekas in the US; unsurprisingly, he was a close friend and collaborated with them both. Satori Sur focuses on their correspondence while celebrating Grinberg’s 80th birthday, surrounded by memories, unpublished texts, unwritten books and existential notes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mWLzxVmwdi8h0CEzPkWvvtosl4V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138177,"logo_path":null,"name":"Los Andes Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2019-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satori Sur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
