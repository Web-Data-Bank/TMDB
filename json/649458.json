His forest pals, Cha Cha the Squirrel, Flops Hare the Rabbit, Simon the Mouse and La Rue the Bird, know that snowflakes mean it's time to go sledding together. But Cha Cha is scared to sled, so she pretends she can't unless she finds her \"lucky\" nut. The hunt for the nut takes the group on all sorts of adventures, from a close call in a bear cave, to a wacky visit with Sly Fox, the inventor. It's a fun-filled journey of giggles and songs, with leons to learn about being afraid, telling the truth and how to be a friend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/60ILIPbEdF7XCd8DC1QaqRMKyIM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20477,"logo_path":"/u0zjebYOFWdLcpR4hxE8o2zwHKQ.png","name":"DiC Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":62867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dayton-Hudson Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of Snowden the Snowman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
