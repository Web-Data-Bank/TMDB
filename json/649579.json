Through the use of miniature cameras mounted on trained eagles (a vantage point by definition), this aery documentary soars over areas of transit and surveillance, intertwining the birds’ migratory routes with the refugees’ desperate journey into the unknown. A vis-à-vis juxtaposition of human rule vs. nature’s law, which –in all its cruel simplicity– offers a sense of equality that cuts across dividing lines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2U79B5CrtJlwxgSydzzKzpwJOXl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invisible Hand Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Above the Law","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
