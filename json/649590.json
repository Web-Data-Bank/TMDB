Our mysterious guide, drawing on the ideas and visions of the great Irish engineer Peter Rice, explores the hinterlands that surround and gave rise to these structures. It is a rail trip of revelation that wanders from the quiet Bavarian town of Ha√üfurt, to the inner and outer realms of Paris, to the Andalusian city of Seville. Suspended artefacts and ruins from the distant future and the industrial past are sifted through and interlinked with precision and wonder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Floating Structures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
