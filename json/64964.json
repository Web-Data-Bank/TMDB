All \"teenage savages\" at the time when communism disappeared in Eastern Europe, they now view the world in a sinister way. Examples: A woman becomes irritated with a man who has left his dog. A father has an argument with his wife about an alarming (to the parents) arousal of sexuality in their 10 y.o. daughter. A young girl is distressed by her growing realization that she is more and more like her sadistic grandmother. A conversation between two guys, apparently about an old car, takes an unexpected turn.","popularity":0.9,"poster_path":"/lXXBbvUsD9yKuUOgg1E6t001KKs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11007,"logo_path":"/irlUVryOnJuz7iD5K7cy1bdQH4e.png","name":"Inforg Studio","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2003-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":9}
