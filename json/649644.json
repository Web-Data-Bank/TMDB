When a record held by superstar Alex Honnold is broken by little-known climbers Brad Gobright and Jim Reynolds, Honnold drafts fellow climbing legend Tommy Caldwell to establish a new mark that will stand the test of time. Honnold pushes for perfection while Caldwell, a family man, wrestles with the risk amid a series of accidents on the wall that lay bare the consequences of any mistake.","popularity":0.935,"poster_path":"/AvpqNqH2Ls7m7Y8cVr0ubOOuGV4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5234,"logo_path":"/24GREmyxfSHuaLUkrDCVngO18rO.png","name":"Sender Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8241,"logo_path":"/hrskM0GGyClO87ZrTffAg4pC7jc.png","name":"Big UP Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nose Speed Record","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
