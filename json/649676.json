We follow charming Espedal through life and writing, from hiking in the french mountains, journeys to Gran Canaria and Provence and at home with his aging father, always via his typewriter at home in Bergen. A portrait that lives up to Espedal's self-proclaimed goal, to see what is beautiful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cnQfLoxEMpxKksQqQsky02dkIoS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Film about Tomas Espedal","title":"I Want to Live in My Name","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
