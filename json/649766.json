For the title role of Cyrus, Rossini wrote what would be his longest-ever contralto role, to which the great Rossini singer Ewa PodlesÂ´ is both naturally attracted and ideally suited. She is partnered by two young stars of Rossini singing, Jessica Pratt and Michael Spyres, and a conductor-scholar, Will Crutchfield, of great experience and sympathy. Filmed in High Definition and recorded in true Surround Sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nlmAHbFz42hEEUeJfinY89ngm6y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":122225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossini Opera Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ciro in Babilonia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
