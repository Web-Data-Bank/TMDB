This one is an exception. The modernized twist is made to fit the story very well and makes watching this opera very enjoyable. Alagna as Orphee does a great job and and is more realistic than a female singer in the role. His impeccable french is an added bonus for french speakers like me. This is the version of this opera that you would want to watch without getting bored","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/efsZr2FxUm03DV0FJDgEV8ZPlW4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bel Air Classique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2008-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orphee et Eurydice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
