The works are complemented solely with Bacon’s own words, recorded by Derek Jacobi. The artist’s biography is outlined, but the focus is on his ideas: his thoughts about his work, his reflections about how and why he paints. The result is a rigorous and revealing portrait of one of the few artists who has truly changed the way we see and understand ourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9RG3rhOJ3bGf5mT96m9Zpircxuk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Francis Bacon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
