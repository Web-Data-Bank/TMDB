Unlike most, she questions the practices of her country's military, and becomes determined to challenge this rite of passage. Despite her family's political disagreements and personal concerns, she refuses military duty and is imprisoned for her dissent. Her courage moves those around her to reconsider their own moral positions and personal power. OBJECTOR follows Atalya to prison and beyond, offering a unique window into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the perspective of a young woman who seeks truth and takes a stand for justice.","popularity":0.664,"poster_path":"/yUvP3aBLm7Z6WVMG9vcI1lGfUyY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buried Seed Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compton Fundation","origin_country":""},{"id":151145,"logo_path":null,"name":"SFFILM Invest","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If military service is a requirement to live in a free society, is it really a free society?","title":"Objector","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
