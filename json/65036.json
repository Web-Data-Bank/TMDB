The ship captain asks FBI agent Gwen Merced, on cruise, to investigate discretely when Trevor goes missing, probably fallen or pushed overboard as blood traces are found. It's unclear whether the Hungarian business trio Luka, Max and Ben are innocent flirtatious gamblers like Trevor or criminals, but others have hidden agendas too.","popularity":4.389,"poster_path":"/95jnsboZ0kKFC09q60uz7SIo7Df.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6679,"logo_path":"/doO7VwcEUnidNW0iUJkIF2oZ8Yq.png","name":"MarVista Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7274,"logo_path":"/3eczK5vkLcskBQ8dv4yDChhYPJI.png","name":"Island Film Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deadly Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":20}
