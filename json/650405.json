Rui Silveira films this tradition in his birthplace, taking us on a trip out of time. Capturing the smallest details, he conveys the patience and skill that go into a beautiful ephemeral art that brings the community’s spirit to life; meanwhile, questions related to rurality and exile keep cropping up in the conversations. The fragility of the paper flowers, threatened as much by the weather as by souvenir-hungry tourists, is a window on an ages-old world struggling to protect its integrity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oad87l6EFTJ6cYje8xZen92JhuZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Os Olhos Do Meu Amor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
