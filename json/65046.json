D.J. Ken Sherry arrives from the hustle of Brisbane to run the station; he's mid-40s, detached, thrice divorced, hatchet faced. But both sisters next door find him attractive: awkward Dimity, only 20, who works in a Chinese restaurant with few patrons, and perky Vicki-Ann, a hairdresser with a hope chest who invents a happy future with Sherry based on little but his arrival. First Dimity then Vicki-Ann spend the night with Ken, one concluding he's her boy friend, the other her fiance. Then Dimity begins to smell something fishy.","popularity":1.98,"poster_path":"/fXBWYmK9MybKhqvmyj57KyFEcq3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":418,"logo_path":null,"name":"New South Wales Film \u0026 Television Office","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":11840,"logo_path":"/8oyCRYf6ezxB5h8HJIPVG8JjzgL.png","name":"Film Victoria","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":14089,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jan Chapman Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1380,"logo_path":"/y4JH9ncZJAFJGYWK84k1dmXnsw0.png","name":"Australian Film Finance Corporation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1996-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two sisters will do anything to hook the right man.","title":"Love Serenade","video":false,"vote_average":6.316,"vote_count":19}
