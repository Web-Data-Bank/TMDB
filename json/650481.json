No one has ever really seen it. Yet people swear they heard it howling at night. Is it a fantasy? Is it an expression of superstitions and tales? Many stray dogs live in the park. Two sisters take care of them every day. Among the thick branches and crowns, certain people hand secrets out, kids play hide-and-seek, runners pass by and some prostitutes wait for sporadic clients in the sunlight. At night the scenery changes: the tones become more confidential and in the dark, intimacy, life stories, obsessions and memories of those seeking refuge in the park, resound among the branches.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sz1RkGe0BhIVWoyoMoGMkNgz2rJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There's a Wolf in the Park of the King","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
