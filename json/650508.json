This film of a conceptual artist's work is a document of Skyworks but also meant to be expressive as an art film. A film of meditation revealing the cosmic breath as Skyworks pieces fall at the rate of 120 to 135 miles per hour. A breathing language of light and knowledge. Performance-controlled flight. Gyres cycling in and out - the mystic spiral. A perception of light and space as energy lines alter the environment temporarily.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skyworks, Wind & Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
