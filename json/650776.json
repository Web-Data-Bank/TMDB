Plus they’ll love the animated story-song “Swamp Man” and the free game included in the bonus features. Children love the grandfatherly explorer/singer Buddy Davis, who leads them through the everglades on an air boat, via all-terrain vehicles, on flat bottom boats, and via hikes that reveal powerful alligators, amazing manatees, intelligent dolphins, cranes, a black bear, snakes, snapping turtles, and more! You probably didn’t know just how big the variety of everglades animals is.
