Real-life adventurer Buddy Davis inspires kids with fun, creation-based science and an infectious passion for the gospel. Buddy flies an old single-engine airplane to the Badlands of Montana, uncovers a BIG dinosaur bone, and in the process reveals the effects of Noah's Flood. Your kids will see a remote area of the USA where the powerful floodwaters of the Genesis scoured the earth and left a mangled graveyard of dinosaurs, fish, plants, and moreâ€”a treasure trove of fossils! Both the Bible and the dinosaur evidence point to a recent, worldwide Flood!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/exTrIgpXeEG5tKHmNvbIPLNqcab.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110089,"logo_path":null,"name":"Answers in Genesis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Dig Dinosaurs!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
