Their connection is palpable, leaving the viewer envisioning a possible real life encounter between the two outside of the realm of this project.  One on One is a series of video dialogues between the inmates at California Institution for Men in Chino, California, the members of the Church in Ocean Park in Santa Monica, California, and a group of Crenshaw residents in Los Angeles, California. One on One was produced while Wendy Clarke was the artist-in-residence at the California Institution for Men in Chino, California. The series uses the medium of video as a means to form relationships between people who would otherwise never get a chance to communicate with each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One on One: Ken and Louise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
