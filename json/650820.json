We meet scientists who changed the world, like Faraday, Franklin, and Tesla and we glimpse the future, as Solar Impulse becomes the first plane to complete a round-the-world flight powered only by the sun. With a mix of chalk animation, CGI, archival footage and spectacular aerials, the film also explores the challenges ahead: how to meet the growing energy needs of our industrialized world, while also protecting the health of our planet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wc4wrt2MMAap1Xye1mZb24DPLPT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10159,"logo_path":null,"name":"nWave Pictures","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Planet Power","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
