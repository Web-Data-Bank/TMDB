At this time in his life, LaVey was seeing only a select few people. For this film, I've met and interviewed some of them, to try and create a composite image of what he was really like, and what he meant to these people. It's a memory lane trip, filled with personal stories, dark humor, great music and never before seen material with the Black Pope himself.","popularity":1.148,"poster_path":"/pFOzRUth4EtfIJIC3ZxGPLCfFqa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sex… Scandal… Satanism… Step inside the dark mind of America's most feared iconoclast","title":"Anton LaVey: Into the Devil's Den","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
