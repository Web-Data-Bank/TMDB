More than 15,000 people come every year. This is the largest Ukrainian fair outside of Ukraine, and it has even been entered into the Ukrainian Book of Records.  This festival presents life in all its vividness, variety, and unpredictability, with the beauty contest as its central motif. The protagonists of Gogol's works are transported to the modern day in all their enchanting absurdity, and they fit in pretty well.  It is a kaleidoscope of incidents and viewpoints, observed with engagement and curiosity.","popularity":0.604,"poster_path":"/8oTvkhy2mbgeGXuo0AzmzjJp9Eb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Volia Films","origin_country":"BY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celebration","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
