These men live in a place which is not a home. Martins, the barber from Luanda, Simões with his spears, Manuel and his films and Francisco's silence share a place to rest, a shelter. They have some affinities with the outside world but they communicate through the words that they don't say. Perhaps the differences are clearest in everything that is silenced.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eznjUXvDWfCeVfPeLfw1hw0FPjr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125761,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andar Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2010-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nocturnos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
