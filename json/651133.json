What moves it is the desire for creation, but this cannot be carried out freely without a process of accumulation: hence the need to leave the cave in which it finds itself in order to seek a comparison with the world around, to experiment and experiment. The tower, on the other hand, will represent an opportunity to test a process of redefining one's own identity, a questioning of the self that is possible only through the contemplation of another destiny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carro","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
