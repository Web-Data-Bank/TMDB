Andrómedas observes them as they go about life, focusing on their everyday interactions, while other women pop in with the latest gossip to share around the kitchen table strewn with saffron flowers. The flavours rising from the pots on the stove waft outside to the cats in the courtyard as the sounds of the outside world drift in and the trees look on. However, this delicately balanced world is about to be upset when María asks for a fortnight off.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mDFltMakLQwY3o8yUDQxVO38S2a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andrómedas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
