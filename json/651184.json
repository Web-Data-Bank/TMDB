His name is Dan Mark - nothing less! - and his life is a state of constant action, which in no small bit is due to his diagnosed ADHD, but which can't reduce him to a social case study. On the contrary, RÃ¸dbro is at a highly energetic eye level with the young man, whose parents and friends pour good advice down on him about the life that he is about to become adult in. A piece of modern street documentary by one of the Danish film scene's most promising names.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dan Mark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
