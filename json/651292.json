Vladimir Ashkenazy was a graduate of the same Soviet school of piano playing that produced Sviatoslav Richter, Emil Gilels, Lazar Berman and a host of others of that era. There are simularities that unite them, including a broad romanticism, a degree of Lisztian showmanship coupled with periods of introspection, powerful technique that occasionally borders on pounding and an intellectual streak that produces some deeply insightful playing. Ashkenazy was younger than the others, more modern in his playing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pRI3iPYijPPmz00i4jjLZ6W8ggf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":277,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven Piano Concertos 1-5","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
