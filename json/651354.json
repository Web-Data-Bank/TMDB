Just a bunch of slightly left field individuals trying to run all four of Hong Kong’s ultra trails ‐ totaling 298km ‐ non stop, unsupported and in less than 60 hours. Each year a small group of runners are hand selected and Breaking 60 explores the personal challenges facing 4 of them. Since its inception, no one has ever gone sub 60.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aIhpKCrZbtT7nfn4Y7i33lBldus.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Breaking 60: Challenging the Impossible profiles the Hong Kong Four Trails Ultra Challenge, a non-stop, 298km, Fat Ass-style trail running event where there are no race fees, no prizes, no medals and no pats on the back.","title":"Breaking 60: Challenging the Impossible","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
