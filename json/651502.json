With portraits of the different generations and genders involved in building a strong and proud community, it gives the audience an idea of the conflicts and the stigma that LGBT face but also a sense of the types of changes they are going through in Vietnam. Vietnam is at a turning point regarding its policies towards homosexuality. In a society that is evolving at a very fast pace but still deeply anchored in family traditions, how does it feel to come out? By means of the life stories of gays, lesbians and transgender people in Hanoi, the documentary gives an overview of why Vietnam might well become the first country in Asia to allow same-sex marriage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uDd12UcMcSpiUi4jkR1u5T5f6Gi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Over the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
