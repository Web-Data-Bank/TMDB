My feelings not being reciprocated, I suggested that he participate in a project that would allow me to see him on a daily basis. \"Vosges\", a five-minute short film, focused, in a one-scene shot of a young man walking with his back to us through a forest, on the notion of desire and how to capture it. \"Compilation, 12 instants d'amour non partag√©\" (Compilation, 12 Moments of Unshared Love) is like an attempt at communication and seduction through listening to songs, and questions the amorous gesture and its impact. In the third part, I wish to confront the crystallization with which I've experimented, its effect on my gaze, during Arno's many absences, to confront his words, sense his perception of an entire summer spent being in the shoes of someone who refuses the love of another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4a1DVGtrjBkUmRW1m0hy96SwmsB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Je flotterai sans envie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
