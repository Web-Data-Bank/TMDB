Because from the Nature’s point of view there is no such thing as waste. It’s the symbiotic aspect of life. The whole Nature is a unified system of interdependent variables. Each one with a cause and reaction.  Freeganism is an alternative lifestyle based on the boycott to capitalism, aiming to reduce the impact in our ecosystem, rejecting any form of human or animal exploitation. This is achieved through the limited and resource-conscious consumption, as well as the rescue of waste, in a society that produces above its needs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yl75lqUS2BCQA00ZCZFo3QKLqEB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wasted Waste","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
