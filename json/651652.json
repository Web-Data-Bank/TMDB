Sammy the Dolphin will guide our mini-submarine and protect us from dangers. And of course, we will need his protection. We soon encounter a sea monster and have to run for our lives. We dart inside an old tanker ship, pursued by the monster; we escape but the monster bites the tail off of our submarine, hitting the fuel tank. The captain hits the ejector button; the explosion blows us out of the water and we splash down back at the mother ship with our mission completed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seafari","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
