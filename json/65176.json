Meanwhile, Kasumi is sent to investigate a bandit who intends to assassinate Sanada. As the threat of assassination draws closer the shocking truth is exposed and Kasumi is forced to face off against an unlikely betrayer.","popularity":2.303,"poster_path":"/1LK7OC0ZEL7I1pHguoERDvddY0b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lady Ninja Kasumi 6: Yukimura Assasination","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
