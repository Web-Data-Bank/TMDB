In celebration of the simpler, pure machines of yesteryear, TransWorld Motocross has assembled an all-star cast of riders and mounted them aboard some very special machines to create the most highly anticipated feature-length motocross movie of the year. From the current machines from Husqvarna, KTM and Yamaha, to one-off Service Honda creations, to the perfectly restored 2008 works Kawasaki KX250 thatâ€™s been in cold storage for years now, the bikes of TWMX Premix are second only to the cast that includes Ryan Villopoto, Jeremy McGrath, Broc Tickle, Dean Wilson, Weston Peick, Shane McElrath, Christian Craig, Josh Hill, Sean Collier, and Ashley Fiolek.  TWMX Premix is a high definition journey into the fun side of motocross. Four-strokes may speed the pace, but two-strokes speed your pulse.","popularity":0.846,"poster_path":"/5TpVcr4CPEDXxVMlyJVeJN9ztAr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"TransWorld Motocross has assembled an all-star cast of riders and mounted them aboard some amazing machines to create the most highly anticipated motocross movie of the year.
