At Erzberg, boys become Men. Erzberg is considered to be the hardest single-day Extreme Enduro race on the planet. No other event takes center stage like this one because it is a coming together of dirt bike warriors from all over the world who try and finish an impossible race. They don’t compete for money. The real prize is only to cross the finish. Like mountaineers are drawn to Everest, the Erzbergrodeo represents a pinnacle achievement in the world of Extreme Enduro. History in the making. This year, so much is on the line for the phenom, Taddy Blazusiak, who has back-to-back wins in '07 and '08. No rider has ever won three in a row at this race. Now with the pressure on, can he dig deep and hold off the toughest of Extreme Enduro competitors? Or will a newcomer rise up to pull an upset and make history of his own?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1fh77YfvhQu2W8oKpoA8rTtggcI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"At Erzberg, boys become Men.
