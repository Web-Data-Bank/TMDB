It is beautiful in every way--vocally, scenically, sonically, and visually--and a worthy record of Van Dam's farewell. Van Dam is just shy of 70 in this production, but you would never guess it from his singing or stage movements--a consummate artist. His is a noble portrayal and deeply moving. The Act V death scene is a model of beautiful singing and acting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5buGPIZdr2DCAuw6O7ZtZn1ljoi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Naive","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Quichotte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
