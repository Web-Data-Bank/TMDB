One’s family, three different Germanys including their insidious subchapters, the taste of life. The mother used to be a passionate Chinese checkers player. On the one hand. On the other she was a tailor and fashion designer in the GDR. Her journeyman’s piece: a showpiece with piping, cording, tabs and embroidery around the neckline. One has to love this film, if only for the tender re-animation of these words we presumed obsolete. And for everything else!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xzBQgZboCATZUr7Swnpvx3hLTXs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Halmaspiel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
