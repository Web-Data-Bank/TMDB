His biggest strengths are 'live-shows'. He immediately brings energy into every venue. His trademarks are a worn looking Stratocaster, an old small amp and straight forward rock'n'roll, heavily blues influenced. No other musician will ever be as closely tied to the history of 'Rockpalast' as Gallagher. He started the first Rocknacht in the Grugahalle in Essen in 1977.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cAxoIUJMhIeBBls7Rpqh2vzgmgf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rory Gallagher - Grugahalle Essen","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
