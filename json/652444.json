His house and courtyard are nothing but giant “storage space” for waste products piled two metres high. Šturman accumulates things that remind him of his good old younger days. But behind all this is a great man, a positive individual who decided to live by principles different from those of the modern society: no TV, no internet, no stress. A bohemian lifestyle, which in the recent years has turned him into quite a star.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qgjzcFZeVLOXaRfGn1ZVV3KgAkj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110268,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visoka Šola za Umetnost","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It is Coldest in the Shade of Cages","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
