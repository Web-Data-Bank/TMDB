The aspirations of Afghan refugees are expressed through their political songs dealing with the civil war in Afghanistan, with exile, with Afghan nationalism and with the Islamic revolution. In highly charged and tragic circumstances, music can be used in very direct ways, both to promote solidarity and as an agent of catharsis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oy1BkyUCTuv7CXpJcP2eL3kzwq2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17700,"logo_path":"/30KETxKJcX7cm65WymAKMYPP6C4.png","name":"NFTS","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Pushto","iso_639_1":"ps","name":"پښتو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In highly charged and tragic circumstances, music can be used in very direct ways.","title":"Amir: An Afghan Refugee Musician's Life in Peshawar, Pakistan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
