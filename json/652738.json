The alarms are elaborate: in addition to traditional clocks, horns blow, bright lights flash, and a pot even blows smoke at the sleeper. After several minutes, the bed itself finally bounces him to his feet and he begins to make his way through his house, slowly, keeping only a step ahead of things falling, or cutting through the air head high. He grabs his coat, shambles out the door - and it becomes apparent why it is he must wake up. These surprising duties completed, it's time for an espresso. It arrives like clockwork, right on schedule.","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/nkZ5FLI56DHhh8FVremH8vPoIvT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alya Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":85743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal + Belgique","origin_country":""},{"id":11796,"logo_path":"/tx6LOQcTSqgW8ffKxovuJHjlYVw.png","name":"Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel de la FWB","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":99350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panic Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":99351,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wajnbrosse Productions","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Alarm Clock","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
