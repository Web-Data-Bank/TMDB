The stories of Irene, a Carnian, Christian girl; Pavel, Ukrainian and Jewish; Mehdi, Iranian and Muslim.  Udine. A beautiful city, but one that is perceived as cold and inhospitable by emigrants. Pavel and Mehdi are illegal immigrants, who share an apartment - and concerns about social matters - in the “ghetto” of Via Roma. In love with Pavel, Irene tries to help them, but her surge of solidarity goes perhaps too far, and she regrets it. Mehdi lives obsessed with an ancient guilt: his fragile soul is attracted to Evil. Predestination and moral choice. Two alternatives? Subjection to freedom of Good or Evil. What will the protagonists choose?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vpAtduJVqqFMi3crLSDcxn4o1Fn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126024,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artemedia s. r. l.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There is no truth.
