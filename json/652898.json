Levi got to know him there in 1991. Two years later, he hitchhiked back to Europe disguised as a tourist. But \"in this film there is no main character. Benji, who should have been it, has disappeared,\" it is stated at the beginning of the movie. On her search for traces, Levi associatively links the story of the refugee with the stories of flight of those she meets underway. The journey leads from Germany to Namibia, to the Spanish mainland and the Canary Islands, all the way to Senegal. Without wanting to draw a geographical or political map, an essayistic documentary on the various forms of traveling emerges: vacation and migration, voluntary and forced return.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vMIbgFnL3xtxGPsrw9sAWSQW1ph.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absent Present","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
