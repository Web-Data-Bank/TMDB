Nevertheless, a little community holds out here. In a flawlessly filmed portrait of this extraordinary place, the theme linking the residents is their determination to chart their own course. Bardak was a marine, but his garrison broke up and his comrades sought a better life elsewhere. He stayed behind among the many empty buildings that are slowly but surely being consumed by the elements. Meanwhile, Dima, a young poacher​, flouts as many rules as he can, but gives friendly directions to lost tourists and reads lovingly to his little daughter. Ferryman Alexander is locked in a silent generational battle with his teenage daughter Masha; her eyes are on the outside world. Further along, a little team of ships from the Second World War turns up, and a woman steadfastly runs a weather station.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qO0bWWUQYOpLwNWXRFbnILGCkXR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126028,"logo_path":null,"name":"BLACKCHAMBER","origin_country":""},{"id":8152,"logo_path":"/shnLD1Pj9d1vB2TH93QHSNT5gzW.png","name":"DFI","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Froth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
