The story attempts to reconstruct a particular biblical passage that was given prominence in the Old Testament (Genesis 37-50) centered around the first Joseph’s, parts of the so-called Egyptian episode and the incident in Potiphar’s house (Genesis 37: 36 and 39: 1-23). Although in the biblical story there are no great details about such episode they can be easily imagined, as Strauss and Hofmannsthal did in fact; please refer to Genesis 39: 11-19 for more specifics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aspvptecvPnBTbqYcDSLquoqUxW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Strauss - Josephs Legende","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
