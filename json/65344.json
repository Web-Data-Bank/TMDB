Rocker Spyder, whose debut album was a huge hit saw his follow-on album bomb, causing him to retreat to his small hometown and give up. Seven years later, 27-year-old Spyder reconnects with his long-lost best friend and writer of his debut album Eric, son of a late great punk rock guitar legend, who has long settled into the sedate life of a suburban middle school music teacher. The reunion forces the two to recall their youthful ambitions and re-examine the choices they've made.","popularity":1.53,"poster_path":"/wff36XAWkQWNRD9pJaU9ob0zGdr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Hawk Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every generation has it's legend.","title":"The Perfect Age of Rock 'n' Roll","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":3}
