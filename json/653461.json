The seven-minute \"Mickey-Mouse-style\" film, as its creator mentions in the credits, satirizes the Italian invasion of Greece on October 28, 1940, and especially Mussolini, who recounts his exploits, but reality constantly contradicts him.  Stamatis Polenakis, one of the leading Greek cartoonists of the 20th century and a pioneer of animation in our country, began drawing the sketches for the film in 1942 in his hometown, Sifnos, where he had taken refuge during the Occupation. He worked under the boot of the Italian conqueror, risking arrest.  The film was lost during the Civil War and it was not until 1980 that a negative was found and restored.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mxcgeo82n5gPpT90XQYHkec8aRg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1945-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duce Narrates...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
