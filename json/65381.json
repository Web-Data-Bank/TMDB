With Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke from the original outfit and guitarist David \"Bucket\" Colwell, now a member of more than 10 years' standing, they're supremely tight, running through a succession of hits like \"Can't Get Enough,\" \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" \"Burnin' Sky,\" \"Rock and Roll Fantasy,\" and Free's immortal \"All Right Now.\" Mostly, the songs are well-honed and urgent, free from indulgent solos, but Rodgers--whose voice has always been Bad Company's main attraction--leaves too many choruses to the crowd.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wgAKRE77SSbcJ7Y5e76OzVdOHNI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"17 tracks recorded live at the Paramount Theatre in Denver","title":"Bad Company in Concert: Merchants of Cool","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
