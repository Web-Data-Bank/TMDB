Let our struggles be mocked and our cares abandoned. Allow yourself be guided by a language loving and theatrical performer with a half thought out plan, no professional qualifications and a mouth with a mind of its own. If anything the glint in his eye is more mischievous than ever and his delight in making people laugh has increased. This new show is all about the heroism of everyday life and the huge effort it takes just to survive the ordinary.","popularity":1.1,"poster_path":"/1VpwbRQsHcShHtou450A0ifrJt7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tommy Tiernan: Under the Influence","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":0}
