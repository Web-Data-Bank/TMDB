It’s a movie about cinema and the people that are in it, trapped. It’s like a box where the director keeps the objects of her life, her story and her anxiety, almost without opening it, a movie to be made, surrounded by fear. There is her family lying in a garden of nails, the womb, the city where at any moment, by chance, you can meet a monster.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ssZ1HBT4Q1RIXNgHDhm6v6dQpnT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69545,"logo_path":"/h3XbQjqX2LyFu1L9cKTr0ICXSX.png","name":"Escola das Artes - Universidade Católica","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Wish Instead of a Camera I Had a Fly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
