Well, maybe not that fast; Fats's style was never what you'd call exactly frenetic, and he was well into his seventies at the time of this show. But there are a whole lot of hits--\"I'm Walkin',\" \"Blueberry Hill,\" \"Walking to New Orleans,\" \"My Blue Heaven,\" etc.--and they're just as irresistible as ever, with Domino and band (including a full horn section) in top form as they deliver their brew of R&B, rock & roll, and country music with its distinctively rollicking New Orleans vibe. Aside from the 60-minute concert, the DVD features interviews with Fats, Allen Toussaint (himself a legendary New Orleans musician and producer), author/music journalist Mikal Gilmore, and others, plus a minute or two of Domino and Toussaint jamming at the piano","popularity":0.937,"poster_path":"/noNK3Hs8ypwMOLUi3AnPvxunNYo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12852,"logo_path":"/a2yqtzhDsTCsgccaed7tVCWjkhD.png","name":"Shout!
