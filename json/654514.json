This film tells the story of Atilano Román Tirado, an activist and community radio host of ‘Así es mi tierra.’ Through his story we learn who he was and the risks he accepted when leading the Picachos Dam movement. I remember the first time we spoke—his eyes radiated strength and courage. He told us that the show was his mission, that someone had to be at the front of the movement. Like Atilano, many activists and journalists seek a social reconstruction, a rebirth of the people. “Unsilenced” is a short film that seeks to honor all the people who have risked their lives in the search for justice and love toward others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/88N02r9ZKVf8cw84fSFuHp1edgn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2016-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unsilenced","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
