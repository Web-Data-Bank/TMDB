I love Bauhaus and filmed a big complex by Le Corbusier 'Unité d'habitation' in which, besides apartments, there were originally shops, a hotel, a kindergarten and everything necessary. What's interesting for me, however, is above all to try to get a fragmentary, cinematic feel of the three-dimensional concrete sculpture, thereby experiencing the natural power of the mistral. An intense blue, recurring stage-like views that open up a second level of the image, and a captivating depth of field linger in the memory of the viewer.” —Milena Gierke","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tHLm4l4YJwqfJS3AZfoYT2RyAfh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Corbusier au Mistral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
