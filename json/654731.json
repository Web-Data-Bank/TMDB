Chase, who is another personality of Henry's, decides to look at other Tapes that we're hidden within Henry's house. He desperately searches for answers and clues to find out who he is and if in fact, Chase is the real personality and that Henry was the psychotic one. With each tape that is played, we realize there is a bigger picture than what we realized. Featuring segments from all over the world including Belgium and Japan while also showing segments from several YouTubers who wanted to make their name in the independent found footage community.
