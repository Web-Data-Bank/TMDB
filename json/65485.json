Hosted by tolerant and relaxed Flora, various parties of middle-class people come in -- large and small, young and old, regulars and tourists, married and single -- to dine, converse, argue, celebrate, make confessions; to overhear other people's discussions, to interrupt them, to sing, listen to music, and enjoy life. The camera, just like the people, moves constantly from table to table, into the kitchen and the back room to observe the staff's petty jealousies and frustrations -- until two hours later it's time for everybody to go home.","popularity":2.701,"poster_path":"/4L5sGM2bJUvKrtkpfTKUTjGQGnF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39923,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmTel Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":6246,"logo_path":"/7X6pfxldTiOD7MLo2EQqUQlmOUw.png","name":"Medusa Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Alain Sarde","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1998-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dinner","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":33}
