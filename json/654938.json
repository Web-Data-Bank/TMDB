Originally sold to the public as a pandemic affecting homosexuals and heterosexuals alike, by 1990 it had become apparent that the risk of infection was far higher for gay men.\r In a sad yet sometimes hilarious story of mutual misunderstanding, politicians, gay rights activists and campaigners describe the attitudes, from moral outrage and homophobia to a desire not to offend, that prevented the formulation of a policy that would protect those most at risk from Aids.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of Innocence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
