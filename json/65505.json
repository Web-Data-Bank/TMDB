Unsatisfied with spending her days as a beer girl, the ambitious Siu Min becomes Michael's partner in the restaurant business, and eventually falls in love with him. Michael, however, must reconcile his dream of traveling the world with his other dream of running a successful restaurant.","popularity":1.102,"poster_path":"/o5fbWZdzrSe0ri3ZjeirGyanYXo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2005-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drink-Drank-Drunk","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":7}
