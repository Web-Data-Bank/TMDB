Rebuilt in 2012, but now a scene of utter devastation - shortly after Russian-backed separatists have taken it over. Weaving together the voices of fighters on both sides supported by battle video, we tell an unvarnished story of war through the eyes of those who were there. The desperate fight for an airport whose capture seems more symbolic than strategic, they also show how human nature can adapt - in sometimes disturbing ways - when one's life is on the line.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lUN9CZdmYyfgYFb8v6US92rqRNt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111158,"logo_path":"/9m4vqLnfjoPeyJteUmi2LZQDJ1c.png","name":"Current Time TV","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":106491,"logo_path":"/zfKCwR4LRaLiUdutQpAV0AeVWdS.png","name":"Radio Liberty","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2015-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Airport Donetsk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
