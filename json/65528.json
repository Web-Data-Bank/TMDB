Set in Paris and taking place over an entire night, the story has a complication in that the trio who want to prevent the suicide do not speak the man's language -- he is Lithuanian and speaks no French. So the protagonists comb the underbelly of a nighttime Paris, looking high and low but mostly low for anyone who speaks Lithuanian. Depending mainly on dialogue for its impact, the verbose drama reveals how the protagonists undergo a transformation as the night wears on.","popularity":0.649,"poster_path":"/v8NfPZpqJWLQrN6Dqt4mL2OplAM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Contact Organisation","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":61414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pavox Films","origin_country":""},{"id":21172,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alter Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19102,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paris Interproductions (PIP)","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1960-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pantalaskas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
