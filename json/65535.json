Within the shadows of their mysterious surroundings, they discover millions in loot, seemingly left behind in filthy duffel bags for no good reasons. That was not all they would uncover – for two rotting corpses and a loaded gun were next to be found. Already sickly, Fatia experiences strange recollections and trauma in the form of a strange young girl and as well, that of a sinister presence – all clues that point towards an evil that occurred within this dilapidated structure some time ago. Things take a turn for the worse when the gun goes missing, their friendship self-destructs and Fatia’s haunting escalate to a point where she teeters on the brink of sanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2011-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Way Out","title":"Dilarang Masuk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
