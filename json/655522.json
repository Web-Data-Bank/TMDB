Many things are like today, one thing isn't: The number of terror attacks has increased so rapidly that any gathering in public is prohibited. Any form of culture and most of human interaction is mediated by an electronic device. The psychologist Claire decides to break the isolation and plans a secret concert with her brother Aurel, a famous trumpet player who has performed concerts in front of virtual audiences only for years. Supported by the hackers Ada and Maximus, their plan seems to succeed. Things go well. Until something else starts to go deeply wrong.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cJEqSZrDflLbSF9vtNaOb8EKNvf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Like Filme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
