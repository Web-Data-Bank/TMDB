Maya is sixteen and tries to find online-fame and understanding through a selfie-live-vlog of suicide notes. She streams constantly to a forum of like-minded users. Her many last words are sometimes narcissistic, sometimes poetic and sometimes very honest. She suffers from depression. When Maya travels to Prague with her parents - a trip, that is supposed to somehow cheer her up - she plans for her suicidal fantasies to become reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t7WUhF5TbHkDm7cSDpIvWaX5nVV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nothing More Perfect","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
