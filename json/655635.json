The film was completed in 1981 as a two-screen piece for live variable speed Super-8 performance.  Sidereal Time was photographed at reduced speeds ranging from 6 frames per second to time lapse, and then projected at variable reduced speeds, both to fragment motion and to introduce a mechanical and sometimes hallucinatory shutter strobe. The film was recreated digitally in 2018, using various editing techniques to reproduce the effects of analog projection in the shutter-less digital medium.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sidereal Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
