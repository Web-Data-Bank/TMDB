Their songs are mainly old Scandinavian ballads presented in a unique soundscape spiced with a haunting disturbing aspect. Chapbook stories who sneak up on you through eerie backwards fiddle, strings, programming, soundscapes, then the beats kick in, banging for dear life, and the cool, authoritative voice of Emma HÃ¤rdelin floats over the top.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jDcYBf63AEfGIrqGNnZ0vDUZzYf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126503,"logo_path":null,"name":"NorthSide Records","origin_country":""},{"id":126504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Massproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garmarna: From Hamlet to Hildegard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
