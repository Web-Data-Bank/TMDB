When the Indian is unable to trade his furs, he reluctantly accepts gold pieces from Beauty Smith in exchange for White Fang. Smith is an evil man who cages and torments White Fang so as to transform him into a hateful, fighting dog. Smith travels the Yukon staging dog fight and making substantial sums of money from White Fang's victories. After a particularly brutal fight in which White Fang is severely injured by a ferocious bull dog, an animal lover, Weedon Scott, stops the fight and carries White Fang off.
