Beethoven’s own instrument was the piano, and in his improvisations – which made him the darling of the Viennese salons – he merged virtuosity and unbridled expression. The piano concertos give a clear idea of these performances. At the same time, they are prime examples of Beethoven’s ability to create large orchestral works with seemingly endless arcs of tension.  The complete recording of all five works with Mitsuko Uchida and Sir Simon Rattle was one of the most spectacular projects of the Berliner Philharmoniker during the Rattle era – and at the same time the highlight of the collaboration between the orchestra and the pianist, which began in 1984.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sypByCwK4yj3EzFaBDU7yjCdSB0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berliner Philharmoniker Recordings","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":205,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven: Piano Concertos 1-5 - Uchida, Rattle","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
