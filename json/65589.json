From the comfort of your seat, you'll thrill to the larger-than-life vista of raging waters as you take a heart-pounding ride over the Falls and experience other death-defying stunts performed there.  Meet the daredevils who challenged the fury of the Falls: The Great Blondin, who completed a death-defying tightrope walk over the river in 1860; and Annie Taylor, a 63 year-old teacher who was the first person to go over in a barrel and live to tell the story.  Created by Academy Award winner Kieth Merrill, the film takes you back to before the first Europeans discovered the Falls and gives you a glimpse of their 12,000 year history. No trip to the Falls is complete until you've seen Niagara: Miracles, Myths and Magic.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/wly8WLgg8Uyo5SOqJfhx1s1mbTi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Niagara - Miracles Myths and Magic","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
