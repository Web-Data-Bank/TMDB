Before Rupaul had raced or Lilly Savage had shop lifted, Danny La Rue was it. From very humble beginnings to fisticuffs with Princess Margaret, he did it all & no lip syncing either. Danny sang, danced, acted, entertained but mainly sparkled and to dazzling effect, capturing the hearts of a nation. Adore him all over again as we take a trip down memory lane.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/80ZaJLkQ5qlHSFSqDQ7CWIbPApm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unforgettable Danny La Rue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
