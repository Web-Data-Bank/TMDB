A chance to change.  Meet Rebecca, a beautiful trophy wife drowning in the vapid lifestyle of the rich, bored and unhappy.  When her sadness drives her over the edge of a cliff, she's left concussed and confused, not remembering the life she so desperately longed to escape from. But with every near-death tragedy lies the potential for transformation. When a sexy red-headed nurse triggers her hidden desires, she starts to wonder if it's even worth the battle to regain her memory, the memory  of a person she doesn't really want to be: a woman with a cheating husband; a woman who she finds has been cheating herself. But will Rebecca see this as an opportunity to create the life she's always wanted? Or will she submit to a life of material wealth and a loveless marriage?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ui3c6sOLXDm7cFPVHyYfyp3qqPX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/pXHXO1qKuQEDv8NDvoNmSaV4gvi.png","name":"Wicked Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Rebecca","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
