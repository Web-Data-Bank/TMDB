The reason: he hums while working, which invariably irritates his superiors. He is not hired as a singer for all that, as no music producer is prepared to bet on him. At the moment he is as free as a (singing) bird and accepts to take care of Josette, the little daughter of Jeanne, his neighbor, who is sick and has to go to a sanitarium. One day, while walking down the street, he helps an old man who has an attack. The latter happens to be an influential millionaire. And with a heart of gold into the bargain : he helps Albert to make it in the singing career. And as Jeanne has recovered, he can marry her and adopt Josette.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/d2tprCxUFOEX61OdBHfq67nXX6c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Calamy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1937-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Josette","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
