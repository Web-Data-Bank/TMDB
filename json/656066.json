At Bastøy they grow vegetables and chop trees. Is it the way out of crime? Benjamin is 28 and has been in and out of jail since he was 16. Life behind the walls is home to him. Trond has been a notorious torpedo (money collector), but wants to create a different life. Now they are looking for Bastøy, an open prison on an island in the middle of the Oslo Fjord. There are no high fences, walls or barbed wire here. Here the inmates are surrounded by water and wild animals. They grow their own food and practice living a normal life before they return to society. Will Trond and Benjamin have a chance to move on? Norway is known for having the world's most humane criminal care, but in the past year nearly 300 open prison spots have been closed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9gKA4Db0i4eslqNRW1BNxNSP8va.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2019-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frie Fanger","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1}
