The people she meets are as unfortunate as her family. Her father has recently left for another woman, but he constantly returns home, unable to make his choice and thereby making the life of close people intolerable. The mother painfully endures the breakup and constantly sleeps, ignoring reality. Lera doesn’t know how to carry on, where to go and what to live for, and — most importantly — how to improve life. The adult world, invariable unfortunate, which Lera observes day and night, seems hopeless.","popularity":4.545,"poster_path":"/qbM1tJps4jIjHNZodQON05zp1eR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Russian Revival Company","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":116846,"logo_path":null,"name":"R Media","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":15755,"logo_path":"/cZDbkvJPOnzHlmu2CDx05DcEnaf.png","name":"Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":125613,"logo_path":"/llbR8dccO5UlzJ3x1gzdQWmOuuS.png","name":"Kinoprime Foundation","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":3419,"logo_path":"/byrxE2pJD9JLyBCIzyK0pYVanyG.png","name":"Central Partnership","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Student","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":7}
