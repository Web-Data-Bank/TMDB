Of course, there is a low season at any resort. But only here, in Bulgaria, it comes literally. First, the English dog disappears, then the lion, and then the already few tourists disappear altogether. Yura will have to defend his right to live and love in a fierce battle with unknown monsters that threaten all living things. Fortunately, the invincible monsters have one weak point: alcohol is poison for them. Now, in order to survive and defeat the unknown evil, the heroes will have to drink without getting dry.","popularity":2.296,"poster_path":"/xoIk7ikX2XnhSkfQTidDOKPxZP4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78191,"logo_path":"/3mmmEA0dRl3LtTx1i7L66giX5IW.png","name":"DixiMedia","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and Monsters","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":5}
