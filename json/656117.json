These were military grounds and training camps, govern- ment buildings, natural parks where speculators have constructed illegal apartment blocks, nudist beaches... in Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, Russia and Australia. The catalogue of land- scapes which, for various reasons, Google Earth glosses over is endless and often very surprising. The project therefore confronts this unrealistic and yet supposedly objective view of Google Earth from a realistic (yet nevertheless subjective) point of view of the ground-level images we have of these places which, in spite of eve- rything, do exist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uxOy21TRwjtyBaGSaefccBTF83f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Places That Do Not Exist (Goggle Earth 1.0)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
