Overall, those looking for subtlety have come to the wrong place, but for those who've lost their faith in two-chord rock--hold on tight and let the Hives take you on an adrenaline-fueled ride.","popularity":0.671,"poster_path":"/cy0318gXS7gkYpQJA8Qd5o6aZH0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In Concert, In Film, and On Video!","title":"The Hives: Tussles in Brussels","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
