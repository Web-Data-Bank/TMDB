A man of stark contradictions, Thevis by the 1970s commandeers a sprawling empire of smut from his base in the puritanical Deep South, while simultaneously running a plethora of legitimate businesses with a nearly all-female executive team. Craving respectability, he sinks millions into the arts, music, movies and charities but ultimately is bought down in a noxious web of murder, blackmail, arson and extortion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Peachtree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
