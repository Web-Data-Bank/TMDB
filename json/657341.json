That's where we went for\r beer and tequila whenever we had to take a break from our work at\r Anthology Film Archives, and it was also a bar where most of those who\r came to see movies at Anthology ended up after the shows. We always\r had a great time at Mars Bar. It was always open, there was always the\r juke box, and very often there was no electricity, and it was old and\r messy and it didn't want to be any other way â€” it was the last escape\r place left downtown New York. So this is my love letter to it, to my\r Mars Bar. Mars Bar as I knew it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A great time at Mars Bar.","title":"My Mars Bar Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
