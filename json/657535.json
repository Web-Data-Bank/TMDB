Miraculously, 22 children survived by swimming to shore; the rest of the students, and their driver, weren't so fortunate. Over 50 years later, filmmaker Michael Crisp reflects on the accident that broke America's heart by speaking with crash survivor Martha Burchett Marsh and numerous other locals whose lives were forever affected by this heartbreaking catastrophe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dzasZ7BPPDHnsJC3IEiMCUyBwJC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126790,"logo_path":null,"name":"Remix Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The True Story of the 1958 Floyd County School Bus Disaster","title":"The Very Worst Thing","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
