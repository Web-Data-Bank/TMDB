Preferring to rely only on herself to support her lifestyle, she chose to become an au pair for a few months. Fortunately for her, her search was very successful and she was lucky enough to find a charming host family... on the surface.  Anissa Kate and Kristof Cale have a superb house that Anissa hastily shows Poppy around as soon as she arrives. The pretty blonde didn't expect such a warm welcome. When Anissa hugs her to welcome her, she is a little surprised... but this is only the beginning! After a welcome dinner, Poppy goes back to her room while Anissa and Kristof both go to theirs.","popularity":0.962,"poster_path":"/9KSSo1FlYvHXWZFpFhdt2tqlEA1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6258,"logo_path":"/bdPHOJ9ErF9WvTmHvVxJCW4AsYM.png","name":"Marc Dorcel","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Au Pair's Initiation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
