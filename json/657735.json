(Well, it’s a little more complicated than that…)  Davies’ play reveled in breaking the fourth wall: cameras and microphones are visible throughout and the play’s author/star himself even ends up a member of the audience.  Starmaker was a dry run for the themes of the Kinks’ 1975 album, The Kinks Present a Soap Opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y5v3oXrLBH3slWxokvTEej7tV30.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starmaker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
