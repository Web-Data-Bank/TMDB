Kazimierz Karabasz interviews two generations: young people finishing high school and the older, retiring generation. They are all passengers of the train, which takes on a symbolic dimension here. At first we listen to their statements, among other peers, then look at them closely. In the background are lines by Tadeusz Rozewicz about the end of one era and the beginning of the next. In the statements of people retiring abound concerns about the financial situation, restoration of pensions. Tired of work, without prospects for a peaceful future, they recall with fondness the past. Young people are afraid of the future, talk about their perspectives and aspirations. Passengers on the train sitting next to each other often in silence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Dawn and Before Dusk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
