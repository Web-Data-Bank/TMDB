It’s the silence of a starry night that whispers the answers he seeks and the profound knowledge of trees that gives him courage.\r The whole world is our home. From our body where we move in when we are born, to everything on this planet we all live in. We are all connected, we are all one, therefore wherever love is our home is.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"#whereishome?","title":"Where is home?","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
