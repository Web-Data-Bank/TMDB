Fa-la-la, that doesn’t sound like Nature Cat? Daisy, Hal and Squeeks are upset because Nature Cat’s desire to celebrate Christmas in a great -big -way is causing problems with their friendship, as well as bothering all of the animals in the woods. It’s not until Nature Cat is visited by the spirits of Nature Past (Daisy), Present (Squeeks) and Future (Hal) on Christmas Eve. But can he finally change and learn the true meaning of Christmas in time for the holidays?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/84F8pD9IRrxHQG6HznEVPICUSSN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53562,"logo_path":"/6DPply0cR2I17OzmwORLm5kKZ36.png","name":"9 Story Media Group","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nature Cat: A Nature Carol","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
