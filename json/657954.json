His novels The Stranger, The Plague, The Rebel, The Fall and The First Man are all discussed, as well as his childhood in French Algeria, sometimes difficult friendships, role in The Resistance during WWII, 1957 Nobel Prize, his issues with Communism, living in exile in the '50s, and his accidental death at 47. His life is spoken about by the narrator, his sister-in-law, his son, his daughter, friends, critics, scholars and mistresses. The impression is of Camus as a charismatic, flawed, and yet principled man when it came to the task of confronting human existence without conforming.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/slA3cyYzlh5ylmydhFpE05QGqQx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albert Camus: The Madness of Sincerity","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
