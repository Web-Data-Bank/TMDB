There are also rhythmic bursts of feedback and percussion that are almost danceable and subtle Zen like meditations full of slow sustained notes that fill the air with otherworldly overtones. The Multiple Otomo DVD provides a dizzying compliment to Otomo's music, full of jittery images both real and manipulated, flashes of visual white noise, strobe-like quick cuts, multiple split screens and extreme close ups that put the instruments Otomo is using into a new visual context.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qlyKWEqG9TJBLBfbFQvkt9ibWlJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Otomo Yoshihide - The Multiple Otomo Project","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
