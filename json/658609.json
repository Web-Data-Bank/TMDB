The DVD also includes the previously unseen Blue Screen versions of Jeepster and Life’s A Gas from Germany’s Beat Club plus the actual broadcast versions of Jeepster and Life’s A Gas. The rarely seen official promo videos for Get It On and Jeepster are also included, plus live performances of Girl and Cosmic Dancer which were recorded at the performance of T. Rex’s historic Wembley Empire Pool concerts on March 18 1972.  These were not included in the concert film Born To Boogie (which used none of the matinée concert footage).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gvEaGwYxc3MP5K7OE5zGmk1gHb5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74382,"logo_path":"/3W1gOKEbPfvL0O0tEusVvYuI8Ju.png","name":"A\u0026M Records","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4614,"logo_path":null,"name":"A\u0026M Sound Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":11043,"logo_path":null,"name":"A\u0026M Films","origin_country":""},{"id":49782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal/Music/DVD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"T-Rex: Electric Warrior","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
