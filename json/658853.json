Now, experts at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History are meticulously conserving this fragile volume, page by brittle page. Along the way, they discover subtle hidden clues to Jefferson himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4djKcs60fVjgRIhYJQzkPmLirlH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jefferson's Secret Bible","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
