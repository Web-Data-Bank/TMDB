Weve traveled across the US and captured stories of families experiencing the joy of working in Gods creation. From a simple garden in a suburban backyard, to a full-fledged multi-thousand acre farm, or something in between, these stories will not only bless those that are contemplating an agrarian path, but all families that have a heart turned toward home and enjoy seeing a beautiful picture of family life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gJkZ1v9EVKeo1MCY5HyCrOpq4hk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inherit the Land: Adventures on the Agrarian Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
