The roll was scanned at 4k by Matias Gritti and then I deleted around 500 photos that did not come out and I touched the color a bit. Then I turned the photos into a timelapse, making each photo appear for a second. The images are from my trip from Mexico to Buenos Aires and ends at the Cannes Film Festival. The audio in the short is composed of recordings I made with my phone in all these places.
