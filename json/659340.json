The aim was to visually invoke the album’s sensual and lyrical breadth and depth, and to subtly reflect the underlying social and political issues of that time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jxon6rpFpGjfx9FGNCHeR504Ppz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127082,"logo_path":null,"name":"Todo Mundo","origin_country":""},{"id":1144,"logo_path":null,"name":"Félix Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Umbabarauma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
