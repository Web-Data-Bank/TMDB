He magpies and gleans away pedestrian gems, and from his hoard he conjures up a prolific and kaleidoscopic creative output. It’s a pure and wonderful compulsion. Filmed within and around his creative den – his sublimely cluttered flat in Catford – Adam guides us through tabletops overspilling with springs and metal, tottering piles of collages, and the joys of street signs of Lewisham, offering an intimate glimpse into his processes and passions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adam Bohman: By Biro and Umbrella Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
