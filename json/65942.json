In fact, most people can't help but like him, as he is clearly a sensitive and thoughtful fellow, in addition to being friendly.

Now he has fallen in love with a single mother who makes settling down look more attractive than wandering on. However, achieving the breakthrough to real intimacy will cost him a good deal of pain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iQzxeLged0vhOxMUIO7powTX2fj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vagabond","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
