They practice something called “Hot Wifing” - where their husband’s willingly set them up with other men in order to ensure their wives’ satisfaction. London is so taken aback by the “normalcy” of openness in these people’s marriages that she soon turns to her husband, Tom to see if he might consider taking their own marriage to the next level. However, Laurie is more than surprised when she discovers Tom’s own interest in hot wifing as the two venture down an untraveled road in pursuit of their own sexual satisfaction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4n1P8aUADTCiKZzN3gyrm4bKURD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6671,"logo_path":"/6im4djIvfI8aLD1hVsZTQ2Fi4uL.png","name":"Sweet Sinner","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hot Wives 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
