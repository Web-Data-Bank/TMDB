Things get complicated when the vertically-challenged coffin-creepers get their itty-bitty hands on a sword with the blood of the last slain Tall Vampire. With this relic, they can create a super-race of SHAQ-sized Draculas out of any tall human. Now, the half Vampire / half Human, Drexel, is the town's - and the world's - only hope to stop the countryside invasion of the mini-Demons. There are no SHORT fixes to this TALL problem.","popularity":1.155,"poster_path":"/ffocaVl6gEx6ItAyuEuwX4KltJt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90373,"logo_path":null,"name":"J H Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":90372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panacea Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't look down","title":"Ankle Biters","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":4}
