The piece explores the move from the 4:3 screen ratio to 16:9, which is now effectively the standard for broadcast television and video. In the construction of New Ratio each colour was assigned a particular tone: white was attributed a standard 1KHz test tone; the pitch of the tone attributed to blue was half that of the test tone; and each of the colours in between (in descending order of luminance) were attributed tones at intervals between these values.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f8siTgm19YLQPD92rM7fGPM89uF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Ratio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
