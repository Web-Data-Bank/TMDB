They have to deal with a serial killer who aims at martial arts masters. One after another is killed in the same brutal way. This may be a chance for detective Linda Masterson to work on her first murder case. She gets the job and to her side an other martial arts specialist, Sgt. Tarek Richards. Now they need to find a tiger style master, because the killer obviously uses tiger style kung fu. Not a simple task, since tiger is a very ancient and rare style.","popularity":2.665,"poster_path":"/A6xwAfDrNvUXRVXtuqiLMhnBTmq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shapiro-Glickenhaus Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":12529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film One Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The city is being torn apart and only two cops can stop the frenzy","title":"Tiger Claws","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":26}
