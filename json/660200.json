This absurd situation stirs and mobilizes the local community and tourists who gather by the riverbank. On one hand, the whale is a metaphor for the disruption of the ecological system, but at the same time, it's a medium to study people’s reactions to the death of a huge mammal. We observe a sociological portrait of the audience. People speculate and wonder, offer help or ask questions. The sperm whale appeals to everyone, regardless of their social or cultural background. The movie is a complicated riddle. It depicts how close we are to a man-made ecological disaster – what more needs to happen to stop global pollution?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
