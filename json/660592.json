Then comes a devastating diagnosis, and she leaves the safety of her marriage to Tim for a man she barely knows. The mental illness causes her to behave irrationally and affects her capacity for empathy. She becomes aware that she is unaware. Nick seems wild and free, and is the change that Kathy needs.
