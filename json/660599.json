She finds herself catapulted from the center of Rome in a suburban neighborhood: grey high-rises, boys on scooters and a funny grandmother who spends all of her time gambling on cards. A sudden encounter upsets everything, like a storm: she is 13 years old, lives in the opposite building, and dances the Lambada. Her name is Sirley, she comes from French Guiana and has an ambitious dream: to interpret the Madonna in the neighborhood procession. Between the two an intense, very strong bond is created. Their friendship will lead Nina to finally lose control, and to discover her place not only in the world, but in the heart of her family.","popularity":1.936,"poster_path":"/ojJBnLgY6JNKW0PiUNUZcMb4obK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127299,"logo_path":null,"name":"BiBi Film Tv","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sirley","video":false,"vote_average":5.672,"vote_count":29}
