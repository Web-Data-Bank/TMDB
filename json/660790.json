It’s nice to see you today! I have chosen a selection of my favourite episodes from the new Emma! series to share with you. Walk, jump, skip, dance or wheel your way to the garden as we visit dancing butterflies, baby lambs, kittens and ponies. The next bowtiful adventure is waiting for us inside the music box - I wonder what we will find. Also, pop on your dancing shoes as we try samba, salsa, ballet, tap, Highland, Irish and jazz.  Enjoy learning some Australian Sign Language (Auslan) with me and have a look at the traditional actions for the Tamil version of 'Five Fingered Family'. My dear friend, Emily Wurramara, from Groote Eylandt right at the top of Australia, joins me as we sing 'Watching the Waves'. I’m so excited to feature new songs like the Greek nursery rhyme ‘Mia Oréa Petalútha', 'Walking on the Moon', 'Gumboot Dance' and 'Emma Baila Baila!’. Enjoy this “Emmatastic” feature and have a bowtiful day!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cuEClRkr9GVnUdSEWPEstRXtPQR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emma! 2: Emmatastic!","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
