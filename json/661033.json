Director Anne Wivel invites us to join a group of students and professors as they passionately debate observations by one of the founders of existentialism, while tranquil scenes from nature illustrate the simple life that anti-rationalist Kierkegaard believed might propel us into a necessary \"leap of faith.\" No dry commentary on an anachronistic ethic here: Wivel aims for nothing less than a radical transformation--dialogue made so richly visual, communication becomes moving image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qa1MHCZOXHzxSHSXEsRT3Shn2OB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Søren Kierkegaard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
