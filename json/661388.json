Her pale skin, her blonde hair, her white dress - society's trademarks of beauty, are tainted by the cycles of womanhood. The requirements of men rape her chastity. They exploit her, using her for fertility and household duties. The third in a series of short films with a focus on gametes, exploring the creation and destruction of life. Shot in the vast landscape of Tasmania, Australia, the series showcases the natural beauty of the island state. Featuring several cinematographic techniques and experimental sound design. Ovum uses violent camera movements and music inspired by the 1980s Japanoise scene.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ovum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
