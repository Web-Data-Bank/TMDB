The life story of this extravagant ever-teen, well beyond the usual retirement age, is told inside a fictitious plot about a Master of Ceremonies trying to persuade Aira to stage a show at his cabaret restaurant. Besides Aira Samulin, many other Finnish celebrities appear among the eccentric lineup auditioning for the show, playing more or less their fictionalised selves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fkknn0RU17Dl0ZXa8pBB7fEBZ2N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5240,"logo_path":"/ibvN7yjNr8HR92nOn8d4d6TQrYt.png","name":"Matila RÃ¶hr Productions (MRP)","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2001-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tango Kabaree","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
