Every five minutes or so, the location changes: my circle is continuous while the background shifts: bare walls—a corner with a window on one wall—outside, on a roof, with sky as the ground—outside, on a terrace, with other buildings and windows as the ground—inside, in a living room, bookcase and couch in the background. I'm silent; there's a voice-over, it's my voice: on screen, I'm talking about circling you, wrapping myself around you, as I did around 'her,' a person from my past: a kind of trap. When I go off screen, the talk shifts, becomes dreamier—fantasy talk, quasi-hypnotic—it's as if we're on a beach, we're covered by sand—it's as if we're in a field, we're rolling down a hill.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
