This tunnel complex was well-known among graffiti artists, avoided by pedestrians but a fascinating example of an urban 'black hole'. The registration provides an overview of the happenings during the 'Underpass' project by Garcia, Wright, America and Wijnen: four Saturdays during which the Underpass became a public studio with light shows, live music performances, graffiti acts, performances and personal artistic statements made by citizens of Amsterdam.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Underpass","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
