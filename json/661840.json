Another symphony of the city...inspired by the hectic, rollercoaster times. Buildings were going up left right and centre...‘Money Makes the World Go Round’ came to mind...I developed a little device which carried lenses in front of the camera, with a motor which made the images actually go around...people in the city...people and money going ‘round and ‘round. The soundtrack was pinball machines and muzak. Sydney was showing off its wealth, spreading out and up...Darling Harbour...more and more sparkling glass. A lot of it was the Emperor’s new clothes...many of those ‘buildings’ are still only holes in the ground.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jASn54seJby1nXCVVLc8G1QzKKU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glitter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
