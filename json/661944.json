He works for his lover, Ricardo, a dedicated port worker. Despite their apparent happiness, though, for reasons even Talles can't fully comprehend, he sees himself dragged into an horrendous plot involving international cocaine traffic, two dirty cops and one container key. During the attempted assault Ricardo catches them in the act and things get out of hand. While Ricardo dies as a man and resurrects as the queer rap superstar Rico Dalasam, Talles stays trapped in the remorse loop, trying to figure out what he has done, and why one boycotts one's own happiness.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/dwRtws19tDpRV5kFhTNQdnCKQ15.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seek","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
