With the cultural destruction of the 1980 coup, it became a music genre for the masses. The film features pioneers of the genre, such as Orhan Gencebay, Ali Tekinture, Muhtesem Candan, and Burhan Bayar, who explain the birth of this cultural-musical phenomenon, while its evolution is interpreted by Ezel Akay, Kadir Copdemir, Haluk Cobanoglu, and Serhat Koksal. The soundtrack was selected from a wide range of venues, from beer houses to high-end restaurants, from amateurs to well-known producers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/454jKMv1JkXCdpli7PPJduSA33W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arabeks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
