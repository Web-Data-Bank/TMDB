Action is exaggerated and time seems to blur, as the lovers' tale unfolds poetically into a modern interpretation of the Persephone myth. Shot entirely on Super-8 - the movie traces the poem, line by line, throughout the city of Seattle in sequences of time-lapse photography blended with live-action that collapse and rearrange time and events into memories. Shot as a silent film, \"Last of Our Kind\" features an original soundtrack created by Robin Guthrie interwoven with a voiceover recitation of Rick Linville's poem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xo7o1E9qZawGPbS4SOSYho56qxy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127524,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emerald Reels","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last of Our Kind","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
