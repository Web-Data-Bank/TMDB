It follows a series of rowers ranging from novice girls to women training for the Olympics, as they overcome obstacles and seek greatness. We learn along their journey that greatness can come in many forms and should not always be measured by traditional concepts of success, but rather by individual triumphs. It essentially suggests that athletes can define what success looks like to them â€“ not coming in last place, beating a rival, medaling for the first time, qualifying for nationals, or winning an Olympic gold medal.","popularity":1.1,"poster_path":"/ue8tFpiHE2e4rKN3zUTPf1VzjqF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film on women's rowing and the human spirit","title":"Dare to Be","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
