Jones's greatest scoop was to reveal the starvation to death of millions in 1930s Ukraine, caused by Stalin's policies. A portrait emerges of a fiercely bright young man who preferred a journalist's life of courage and danger which took him from smalltown Wales to even hitching a lift in Hitler's private plane. However, in a 1930s world of competing ideologies, there existed a fine line between journalism and spying. This film explores to what extent this dual role, and taking on Stalin, may have contributed to his early death on the plains of Mongolia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler, Stalin and Mr. Jones","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
