This erotic film was the starting point of a curious career, during which Sylvia acted in more than 50 international film productions, including a short-lived career in Hollywood. A turbulent life followed, in which alcohol and drug addictions formed a recurring theme. Penniless, she now lives in a small two-room apartment in Amsterdam. Last year La Kristel took control of her life: her autobiography Nue was published in France and has already been sold to several countries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/owrWwTbw4yVHszhqhpaxP9YNIxZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55796,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Familie Film \u0026 TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2007-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sylvia Kristel: Nu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
