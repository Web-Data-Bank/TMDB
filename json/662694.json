This will become a nuisance for Stella, since her mother is someone difficult to deal with: she complains, she is afraid of everything, she says hurtful things and she keeps remembering the past. Paula Hernández's new film narrates the journey by bus of these two characters, a simple premise for a film almost always in tension as its two protagonists, brilliantly played by Valeria Lois and Rita Cortese. The only respite for poor Stella, and for the film itself, are conversations she has with Primo (Sergio Prina), one of the bus drivers, moments of calm amidst so much storm that, later on, will become literal.","popularity":0.792,"poster_path":"/fGFmUN18VNDd5TL7zrsVuLhE5wU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64499,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tarea Fina","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2021-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Siamese Bond","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5}
