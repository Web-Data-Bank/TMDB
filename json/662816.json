In the meantime we are shown the gathering of seafood, the coming and going of people at the port and the ruins of ancient Greek settlements: Selinunte, Girgenti. The dominant colours in the film are the blue of the sea, the yellow of the sun and a beautiful red toning to render the majesty of the ruins standing out against the sky. The video is a copy from the film print held by the National Cinema Museum.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lSOfI0DOey2TgKFvRQZvwkCvphn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1910-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through Sicily","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
