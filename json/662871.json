The  grandfather  Andris  is  sceptic  over  the  lofty  quest,  initiated  by  his  grand-son, as it’s not known what awaits them at their destination. Andris thinks they won’t find anything and will come back to Latvia without ever learning what happened to his father. However  ever-optimistic  Kārlis  wants  to  use  the  journey  not  only  to  find  answers  about  the past but also become closer to his grandfather who raised him. They both lost their parents as children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bgP4RV56QHwXQ01oq2OtLKjAosw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woodpecker Pictures","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":118793,"logo_path":"/AckxUfY5wGZjKNnbiWDKubqxX8t.png","name":"Latvijas Televizija","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandfather's Father","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
