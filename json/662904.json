We're literally sick of the digital world engulfing us. People are yearning for real things and authenticity. IMPOSSIBLE is sensuous and inspiring film about the revenge of analog. And the eccentric, crazy Austrian scientist, who saved the world's last Polaroid factory - just when Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone. An entertaining underdog story of a very modern Don Quixote, shot on 35mm. And a sumptuous invitation to fall in love with real things again.","popularity":0.999,"poster_path":"/ouk3izKmLDoUnuOcSf4d1EeUOwE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instant Film","origin_country":""},{"id":16265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mischief Films","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":28276,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARRI Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Swimming against the digital tide","title":"An Impossible Project","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":4}
