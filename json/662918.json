With rising wages, the workers in Christmas factories can now afford newest iPhones, but they still live in crowded dormitories. All migrants in their own country, nostalgic for some place far away, some miss their families left in hometowns, other miss their friends and lovers from the factories when they go home for holidays. Young generation is already tired of long factory hours, chemical fumes and glitter particles, and they do not care for their parents' wishes to get educated. Stuck in between Chinese tradition and the newly discovered Chinese dream, they want their own businesses, to be rich, to be independent, to be in love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ysSQqGbkG40tboXDnRMeKhYOHei.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2020-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merry Christmas, Yiwu","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
