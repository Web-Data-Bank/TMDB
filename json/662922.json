The desire to believe is the hand of the man hanging from a cliff and clinging to the only stone that would seem to save him. But he always ends up falling because the stone is a mirage, just as the cliff is. Death is awakening from this dream in which the essential can be said and in which the continuous and infinite has a beginning, an end and a meaning.","popularity":2.951,"poster_path":"/23CxfKLM0vI9mhSm6i6rtPbDkTL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139972,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bretzel \u0026 Tequila","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Mexican Bretzel","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":11}
