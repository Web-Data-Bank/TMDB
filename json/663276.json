Although I’d been wanting to make this film for many years, I couldn’t resolve the technical challenges with 16mm.

Another “Couplet” from my ongoing Prolix Satori series.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ou9U0VNFgot8dsawmHGXbW74rxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Thousand Julys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
