But they're also taking care of kids, or they just had kids, or they're pregnant. Sara has a nice ass, so she started taking pictures of it and living in the world of social media. Hedvika lives in a bit of a golden cage, her workaholic husband isn't home much, so it's no wonder she's charmed by the young busker David. Zuzana, after her break-up with Kamil, is penniless, just a worked-up and hurried mother of two. Slovak immigrant Eliska, on the other hand, has a great boyfriend, unbearable parents, is pregnant and is sick of everything.","popularity":2.262,"poster_path":"/waOzrhvN8MeZkKta351kLhrYiQn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mothers","video":false,"vote_average":5.286,"vote_count":7}
