We barely notice the prehistoric traces and the contours of the spaces, but we hear all the better: drops of water that have for ages been recreating the shape of the cave and continue to do so to date, as well as echoes of human footsteps. Rubio punctuates this soundscape with memories of the speleologists and revolutionary songs that denounce Franco's dictatorship. A journey through space and time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ojo Guareña","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
