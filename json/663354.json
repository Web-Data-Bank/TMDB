Or the hairy, 800-pound validation of his life’s quest. It’s also a sympathetic insider’s view of taxidermy as an under-appreciated art form. And finally, it’s a call to preserve the last wilderness. Because when there is no mystery left in the deep, dark forest, we’ll have lost more than Bigfoot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zo814axzJfM1cBQPACUOPDazXe2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If World Champion taxidermist Ken Walker can't find Bigfoot, he'll make one.","title":"Big Fur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
