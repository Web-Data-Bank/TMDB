Roz is so much more than a domestic violence and gun violence survivor, she's a warrior. Despite - or because of - being thrown off a bridge by an abusive ex-boyfriend, the unsolved murder of her brother, and the suicide of her identical twin sister, Roz is able to channel her trauma into service by helping the often-forgotten people of North Philadelphia. From giving comfort to families of murder victims to saving the lives of over 600 men and women in active opioid addiction - and training hundreds to do the same - Roz knows that her healing and her survival depends upon healing others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello Sunshine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
