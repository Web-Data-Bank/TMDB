It’s a tribute to disobedience and desertion — in both digital and physical-real warfare. Shot in the picturesque war landscapes of «Battlefield V», the hyperreal graphics become the backdrop for an essay-like narrative. The film revolves around the history of deserters — a part of human history, which has hardly been illuminated. Performances and creative interventions explore the scopes and limits of the audiovisual entertainment machine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/IBPCCHTBnCigl8OYgPoUQW9bRo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138704,"logo_path":null,"name":"Total Refusal","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Disappear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
