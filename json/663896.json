Returning home, he knew that he had to scratch the door only once, very quietly, to check whether she was really waiting for him. Sometimes, when she was getting dressed before the mirror, he could see two Malenkas, but after a while he understood that only the one that smelled beautiful was real. 'I belong to her and I will never leave her', he thought. One day, following the order of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, everyone unable to prove their Aryan roots had to return their pets. This was the day when Brutus' life changed completely.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brutus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
