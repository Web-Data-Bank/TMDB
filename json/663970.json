The catch has been meagre and Wang-nyeoni, the local shaman, is on strike: she refuses to perform a ritual to turn fortunes around. In flashback we learn how she married into a shaman (dang-gol) family, tried her best to help her husband succeed as fisherman, but found both their lives blighted by Pan-su, the village boss and main ship-owner. After agreeing to return to duty, blessing the fishing fleet, Wang-nyeoni will serve up cold revenge in spectacular style.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1rzFJjSIzuOHbQFIYrpBLA92HKt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tae Chang Enterprises","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1979-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divine Bow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
