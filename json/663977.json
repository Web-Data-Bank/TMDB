The stage is often blitzed with light - strobes being used like weapons for the set's biggest anthems. At other times, everything fades, almost to blackout, with the viewer sucked into the darkness for a few moments before the heavy light-assault explodes into life again. Then cut to the images on the screen as each track is illustrated with slogans, graphics and burnt-out, degraded films. Dead Son Rising was a very special tour and Big Noise Transmission is a fantastic document of one of the artist's finest shows.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5fkGIrxkHwtKwsyxz8A101szQSJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127809,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mortal Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gary Numan: Big Noise Transmission","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
