Growing up in a conservative town in Missouri with immigrant parents, her sexuality and desire to be a photographer have become laced with shame and guilt. Six months after moving to LA, we find Esi isolated and disconnected from world around her. After another day of feeling invisible as a PA, Esi stumbles upon a vivid house party of QTPOC (queer and trans people of color). For the first time in her life, Esi is welcomed into a community where she can let down her walls, let go of societal and family pressures and begin to embrace her true self.","popularity":0.652,"poster_path":"/jAaqeAtDBzIExJ8JcbruuClkSVC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barefaced Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunday's Child","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
