It was a life-changing moment...I'm staring down and the tiles come up almost to my nose.\" In this work, he opts for squares and diamonds—\"tilted squares\"—which produce the same chimera of depth, at the convergence of sightlines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bisqMLQZKwkxU0QfKmJ0cIlOWBt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brain Operations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
