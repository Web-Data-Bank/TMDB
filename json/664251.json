The frame of the image shifts from vertical to horizontal and then slowly rotates 360 degrees, adding a layer of more superficial movement to the pulsating, shifting colors of the stream. Thus foregrounding the image as constructed, flat surface, Brook is impressionistic and painterly in a way that much of Jacobs' work gestures at, but rarely fully embraces.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3ZSAnv03yvGxziFVB0QtpIr5WHu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brook","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
