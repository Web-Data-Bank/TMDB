The hidden forces of Cinema conspire with an instant of history to produce actions that never were or could be. 3D for everyone (one eye will do). Regarding the title, one hears on all sides (doing battle) that “God is great”. I donʼt get it, seeing that no one is listening or watching or doing anything about what happens here. However, gravity surely exists, if only for now, until the universe dissipates further, and it clearly decides much—if not everything—that happens. Gravity is the result of momentum, Earth a flung ball issuing from The Big Bang, every species of life a mad effort to regain the once-totality, dismemberment of which made us possible. I donʼt suggest praying to gravity for what you want for your birthday but it is very palpable in this movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gravity Is Tops","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
