Since then, it has evolved to symbolize a greater state of existence defined by isolation, rejection and alienation.  The meme's protagonist, \"WOJAK,\" has become the mascot to a vast online community consisting of self-described \"hyper-anonymous twenty somethings\" and \"guys who slipped between the cracks.\"  TFW No GF asks: How has the zeitgeist come to bear down on a generation alienated by the 'real world'? Meet the lost boys who came of age on the internet- places like 4chan and Twitter, where they find camaraderie in despair.","popularity":2.926,"poster_path":"/h8uVeIF58QQJy4XChEXhcexvuoi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132885,"logo_path":null,"name":"4th Vertical Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TFW No GF","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":29}
