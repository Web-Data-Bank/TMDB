The wondrous ColOZio, which is partly based on true events, starts three days prior with a prophecy to tripping friends Diego and Gael: save Colosio from death. The duo's dancing in a kaleidoscopic animated, almost 10-minute-long title sequence subsequently sets the tone for a playful, delightfully over-the-top road movie. Expect mythical apparitions, cartoony chases and plenty of drink and drugs.","popularity":0.691,"poster_path":"/isBAyTF8ttnxPa2d4eULlsn1VB5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48405,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cuarto Para las Doce","origin_country":""},{"id":18735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Distrito Films","origin_country":""},{"id":123612,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bias Post","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2020-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ColOZio","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10}
