He is the best candidate for mayor of the Beyoglu district – in his opinion. An opinion not shared by his sceptical ex-wife; nor by the voters who come to eat and drink at his expense; nor the party leader, who even after several meetings still thinks he's an architect rather than a doctor; not even his faithful chauffeur. The slogan 'the doctor has the cure' might be catchy, but the doctor has little clue how sick the climate of political nepotism really is.","popularity":1.223,"poster_path":"/6q182kKGeBOZ8Gglm3y1MURKGAz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43853,"logo_path":"/pAQVKxBUMbbeasH41x874EjtsSA.png","name":"Ay Yapım","origin_country":"TR"},{"id":102865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poyraz Film Yapım","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2020-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Know Him","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10}
