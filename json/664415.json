The official reason: fear of espionage. Thus a coercive mass expulsion of women and children started in Albania. Those, who did not obey, spent years in prisons. Families were torn apart for more than 30 years. Today these families are trying to reunite. Will they succeed? The film tells the stories of three of these couples, and of those apparatchiks and officers of the secret services who brought about their destruction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/egUZ1QKTw2e9tIfMVNNZVyhauF2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divorce Albanian Style","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
