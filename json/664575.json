The piece draws from the notion of macrocosm/microcosm as originated by the 16th century theologian Robert Fludd. Macrocosm and microcosm are terms from religious esotericism that refer to a vision of the cosmos reflected within a smaller part of itself. As Above, So Below is made with everyday materials to draw parallels between micro and macro â€“ the commonplace and the divine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As Above, So Below","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
