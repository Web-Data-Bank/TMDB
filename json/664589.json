Together they drift through the summer. During the day they swim in the pool and at night he takes her to bed. She shares his memories and anything else he programs her to recall. Memories that mean everything to him but nothing to her. Yet, one night she sets off into the woods following a fading echo… The story of a machine and the ghosts we all carry within us.","popularity":4.126,"poster_path":"/QP1h00ah2mURcdxQKfZE44Qtmf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123408,"logo_path":"/s13diWaEtNwE5oXUSmB9VaMoEWF.png","name":"Panama Film","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":166136,"logo_path":"/bnXhVMb4vjz0QtqlmwYlQLMMYsg.png","name":"The Barricades","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":296,"logo_path":"/kMFX59w5Sgxx9PVpV4k3ZgspRmz.png","name":"Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trouble with Being Born","video":false,"vote_average":5.414,"vote_count":29}
