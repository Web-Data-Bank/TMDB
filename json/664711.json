The drama unfolds in fifteen tableaux, in which she goes over to Albert’s friend Emile. Still, these romantic worries go hand in hand with insatiable boredom… La fugue de Suzanne is a rare gem in Belgian film history. Self-financed by the director, it creates an absurdistic reality with minimal cinematic gestures. “Jean-Marie Buchet is Bresson or Duras as seen by Henri Rousseau. He is our very own Eustache, stripped from his Parisianism.” (Boris Lehman).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/14JEp4NPqWXpcZ3SoMVbPDEIjzs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hendrik Conscience-Filmprodukties","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Fugue de Suzanne","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
