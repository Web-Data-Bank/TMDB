Deconstructing an episode of TV's Miami Vice that features crude representations of Latino drug dealers, Labat constructs a multilayered psychological drama of converging realities. In a studio (the space between \"cut\" and \"action\"), artists Tony Oursler and Winston Tong provide commentary. Playing out a tragic drama with dolls, Tong also tapes his eyelids down and applies make-up, transforming himself from Asian to Caucasian, male to female. In a final confrontation of identity, Tong steps through the enlarged television image, devoid of masks or make-up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cjvxrJaFn2GIhCtOQUcZ9NtMbkR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mayami: Between Cut and Action","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
