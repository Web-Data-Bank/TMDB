XFILM is my very personal exploration of film as an abstract, kinetic medium. The film, after many months of experimentation with rhythm and form, finally collected and crystallized when I heard Bill Maraldo's unusual electronic tape piece. The opening of XFILM grew from my hearing of that piece, and I still believe that the first five minutes of this film are the most inspired filmmaking I have yet done.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9rpA76rGQfbdAhcRBe9eMzdk7WF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XFilm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
