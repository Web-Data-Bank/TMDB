Uthco artist Doug Hall drew on members of Ant Farm and Optic Nerve to create Game of the Week, a striking document of his residency with the San Francisco Giants. Interspersing footage of himself and team members like Willie McCovey with an actual televised game, Hall was able to fabricate his own field of dreams. The seminal Media Burn combined the creative resources of Ant Farm, along with Optic Nerve, The Residents, T.R. Uthco, and others.
