Hoping to repress her loneliness, Frances invites ‘the boy’ inside her home to get warm and ends up encouraging him to stay. The young man accepts her every hospitality—food, clothes, profuse conversation, and a room of his own. Little does she realize that her guest is not the person he appears to be. Nor, for that matter, is Frances the woman that she appears to be.","popularity":2.992,"poster_path":"/69hSN6FIwSNDZJqHElJejJ2EnI2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Factor-Altman-Mirell Films","origin_country":""},{"id":1427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Commonwealth United Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How far will a woman go?","title":"That Cold Day in the Park","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":42}
