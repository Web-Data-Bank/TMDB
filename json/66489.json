L.T. is a parasite, and contacts Hazel looking for work after he runs out of money. She is reluctant to use him for a hit, since she prefers using women, but decides to try him on a trial basis. Meanwhile, the cop she pays off wants an arrest to make it look like he's doing his job, but Hazel doesn't want to sacrifice any of her \"associates\". The sleazy side of life is explored in this delightfully dark and deadpan film.","popularity":2.091,"poster_path":"/jEO4qgv3KXRoEPg3wEJKX7ITD7O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1950,"logo_path":"/eIoDtHIJKZaZ4hGbKgqC0PzlqJc.png","name":"New World Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bad is good, but it's not nice!","title":"Bad","video":false,"vote_average":6.271,"vote_count":24}
