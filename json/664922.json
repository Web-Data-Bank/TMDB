Everything in his films has an equal presence; it is an animistic world. The nature of his reality is nothing but flux, and everything flows in the space. It is not a dream but the hyper-reality of his gaze and mind dissolving boundaries between the internal and external.' - Aki Onda","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iwqwjIdN9Fk6fd0vical6IUIzQ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Make Visible the Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
