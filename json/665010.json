Ramos, who had served an eighteen-month prison sentence for draft resistence, was interviewed by New York news reporter Gabe Pressman. Using repetition and juxtaposition, he contrasts the unedited interview footage — and patronizing comments of the news crew — with Pressman's final televised news report. In his ironic manipulation of the material, Ramos exposes the illusion and artifice of television news.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Media","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
