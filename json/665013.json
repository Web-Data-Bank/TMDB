In a syncopated collage of appropriated footage (including a TV commercial for Sergio Valente jeans) and a young woman drinking Remy on a commuter train platform, Birnbaum calls attention to how mass media advertising uses a woman's body as a vehicle for selling products. In a stylized pastiche that she terms \"a snack-en-route with a pretty girl, animated trains, updated Bacharach muzak (Brazilian style), and pouring Remy,\" Birnbaum turns the tables on the media's use of woman as commodity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remy/Grand Central: Trains and Boats and Planes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
