Unlike most adaptations of Aleichemâ€™s work, Broken Barriers (Khavah) focuses not on Tevye the milkman, but on his daughter Khavah, who falls in love with the gentile boy Fedka and must navigate the reverberations from this with both her community and her family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fdtj5MdlCl87hysRNKpddEBDieI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127995,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zion Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Barriers","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
