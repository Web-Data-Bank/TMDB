Extinct since the early 17th century, these majestic, horned beasts have long held a mythological status, believed to embody supernatural powers. In the early 20th century, German scientists began a series of attempts to resurrect the species under the auspices of the Nazi regime; such experiments continue today in various forms. Berlin-based filmmakers Anja Dornieden and Juan David Gonz√°lez Monroy use this history to fashion a poetic and deadpan 16mm work of fanciful nonfiction that calls attention to itself as a constructed version of a strange reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rYaXrqGHlZe39PwcSGDKqe67NSC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Name Was Europa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
