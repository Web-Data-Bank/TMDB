But this, as with all things, must fade away. As the top star of the Imperial Operetta Company, Sumire was the power and the light from which her comrades drew their own strength and resolve. It was through her that the Flower Troupe found their courage... and through her that many happy memories were made. Now the curtain rises for one final performance as the star that once shined so brightly to grow faint. As the spotlight dims on one legend, another must come center stage.","popularity":0.98,"poster_path":"/tqHRUIbx1rSxFTjaYnK7Ai547vV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3464,"logo_path":"/9k0nr75nwnNeT2MHerf1OXJN0hj.png","name":"Madhouse","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":113750,"logo_path":"/A3QVZ9Ah0yI2d2GiXUFpdlbTgyr.png","name":"SEGA","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":34894,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radix Ace Entertainment","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2002-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sakura Wars: ~Su~Mi~Re~","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
