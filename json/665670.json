He lives with his elderly mother and wife near Mt. Aso in rural Kyushu. He seeks solace in a small religious group run by Buddhist nun Chishu-bo who claims to be the 68th descendant of famed 11th century poet Izumi Shikibu. The members of her sect regard her as a living saint. Yet instead of balming his soul, she riles his libido by playing a sexual cat-and-mouse game with the fragile Toyoichi. When she does bed him, it leads to a miracle healing -- followed by a terrible calamity.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/25eQV57R8QPGFfZiXF9B5478do0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seiyu","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shikibu monogatari","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
