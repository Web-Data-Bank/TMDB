Capt. Endicott, a friend of Robert's, offers to teach her how to fly. One day while aloft in the plane, the craft takes a sudden nosedive and crashes. The pair walk away uninjured and find shelter in a roadhouse. Robert, upon hearing of this, becomes jealous of Pat's spending so much time with Endicott, which angers Pat. She decides to leave Robert and slips out of the house to catch an evening train, but unfortunately, Endicott is also aboard the train. Robert finds out about that, too. Complications ensue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6AjMHitUlNocoIQL4VY4bOVzXhQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37903,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Art Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the air, she could roar like a kite, And her loving was just \"out of sight.\" But she sure could spurt fire When a man raised her ire; And amuck in a kitchen-good night!","title":"Flying Pat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
