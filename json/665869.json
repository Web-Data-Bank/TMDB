In the film, medical professor Dr. Hobbes (Fred Doederlein) creates a genetically-engineered organism he plans to use to bring about a more sensually aware society, but his experiments turn deadly when the aphrodisiac-producing parasite gets out of control and spreads throughout a swinging Montreal apartment complex. Despite the film's success on both sides of the border, the critical backlash against the film was used to launch a cultural attack on Canada's film funding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Screen!: Shivers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
