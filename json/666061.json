What she found was a tribe, a diverse group of professional adventurers and amateur philosophers forged by the ultimate test of body, mind, and spirit. In the face of shifting winds, sheer granite cliffs, and impossible odds, they climb. Each for their own reason, but every one connected by the vertical world. In this rarefied air, these athletes are fundamentally changed, not just as climbers, but as human beings.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/hix44ztEVB8UQpszOl63JrA66a3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44632,"logo_path":"/neCKH4sJCBhZ1B4QocTM4VXCQOR.png","name":"Gravitas Ventures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":188456,"logo_path":"/urU3nvViNWRQcLQaSqMvBdB0GvV.png","name":"Drifting Dunes Productions","origin_country":"AE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2019-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fine Lines","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
