Religion, war, rebellion, the life of this plant has been so linked with that of mankind that for once we thought it right to let \"Cannabis Sativa\" speak for itself. Hemp first appeared in the Far East about 12,000 years before Christ. In daily life \"Cannabis Sativa\" or hemp was used for making cloth paper and bows. In sacred use it was a medicine and was used in many religious uses in India and with the Scythians. The twentieth century establishes the duality of the plant. In Europe as in China, hemp is used in the textile industry while it is used once more medically in the treatment of numerous disorders. Disadvantaged by the interdictions which it incurs as a psychotropic herb, hemp is a real economic and ecological problem today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w7fA65SuUZehJby22k38dQgKRmy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":20300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Theopresse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le cannabis - Une plante entre le bien et le mal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
