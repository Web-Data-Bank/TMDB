The idea was to edit all the curtains shots he ever made in strictly chronological order – as a pars pro toto representation of his oeuvre and philosophy of cinema.  With Love – Volume One 1987-1996 developed from this project. How close it is to the original intentions behind Curtains, only Pilz can say. But considering that Pilz's whole life and art is about self-development, discovery and realisation, every film he makes is in its own way another sum total. Each film is a debut as well as a cenotaph for what was so far; in loving memory, for a morrow of love. This development demands encounters with other people; that's the only way to grow. Come along and meet Pilz − and yourself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rhi5eEdV0SSP5j3meLrTjpXxjI4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136367,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Pilz Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2020-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Love – Volume One 1987-1996","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
