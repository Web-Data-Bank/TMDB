The visual communication of the city is presented since the painted walls of the 19th century to its neon lights and billboards by the 20th and 21st centuries. It also accompanies the grand transformations the city has gone through. Within the course of a hundred years, São Paulo, which started out as a village, transformed into one of the world's greatest metropolis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rRp9yYPjt9oRBdJbjil9LTzQixR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"São Paulo: Three Visual Essays","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
