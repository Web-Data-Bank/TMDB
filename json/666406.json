Besides being brimming with the passion of memories, personal history, and body language, the film reflects a 20-year generation gap, and captures vernacular Thai communication: a babble of pillow talk and evasive language that masks true feelings. The film documents a six-year relationship in which mutual trust is slowly replaced by isolation and estrangement.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/7rtDyu7gq6XgeWjyE2zm5qIksMo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jürgen Brüning Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":147093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sleep of Reason Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2020-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avalon","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
