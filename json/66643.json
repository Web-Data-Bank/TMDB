Devoted to his craft, Aniket met and fell in love with his wife Deepti, an actress, while they worked together on the set of a film. They were so in love that Deepti sacrificed her own career for her husband's and for their son Apratim, but lost a little of who she was in the process. The plot thickens when Aniket auditions a young actress, Shikha, who bares an uncanny resemblance to his wife when she was younger. Deepti enthusiastically begins to coach Shikha for her husband's film - so much so that Shikha becomes even more like the girl Deepti used to be and as a result the aging Aniket falls in love with Shikha, a woman as young as his son, despite the sadness and trouble it brings to his family.","popularity":0.938,"poster_path":"/sA56RyiTalho8EC9nG6aqpC1uuo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7294,"logo_path":"/kK4PRgceWp9KNrycD8xx8seWxYU.png","name":"Reliance Entertainment","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2009-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Eternal","title":"Abohomaan","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":7}
