A sequence of images edited on camera with a posteriori sound intervention. Cinescape opens windows through the bars. Its title invites the viewer to let go, be taken away by the lens-shot. A double move in which a shot makes the world its prey and releases it again in the projection: a game of light and shadow. Cinescape is an invented compound word Cine (cinema) + escape. At the same time, phonetically it sounds exactly the same as “sin escape”, which means no or without escape. Sound intervention: ROM (Roberto Etcheverry & Omar Grandoso).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinescape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
