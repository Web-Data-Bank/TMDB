Puzzled by the call and the peculiar look of the room heâ€™s in, he leaves his bed to inspect his surroundings. Unfortunately for him, his curiosity leads him to a deadly morbid encounter that he cannot escape. Just as he believes this to be the end, he wakes up again, in his bed, with the phone ringing again. Was it all a nightmare? A delusion? Or something far more terrifying? (Originally a technologically experimental web series with real-world interactivity such as phone calls and text messages sent to the viewer during playback, this simplified version plays as a continuous short film. Created for Fourth Wall as part of their Dark Wall series.)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3a3aAWjlaStAPekMafwxNMsLRld.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6:14","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
