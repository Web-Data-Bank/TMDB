Although continually threatened by development the area stayed intact largely due to being ensnared between two railroad tracks.  Murmur is a collaboration between filmmaker Jan Locus and sound artist Stijn Demeulenaere. Just before first light, they recorded the dawn chorus. The city drone permeates the sound of the swamp, and a strange mix enfolds between the sound of an awakening nature and a human presence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hGk1JOonnGIVu3Y1MqNFVsV19X1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murmur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
