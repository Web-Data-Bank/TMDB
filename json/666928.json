She has no contact with her parents. It is a lonely life, but Chi Li is doing fine. She has a job at a cinema and no need for a relationship. She protects herself this way because who would want her as a girlfriend? Chi Li has epilepsy. In north-eastern China where she lives, this means she simply isn't marriage material.  When a boy nevertheless shows interest, some warmth seems to penetrate her armoured existence. However, a romantic trip to a dance performance painfully reminds her of her past as a dancer. Only You Alone is a powerful portrait of a courageous young woman, made all the more so by the great acting of Chi Yun, who co-wrote the script with director Zhou Zhou.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uXnXhDHmpeuHI96QEGZucTCJ8eo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128244,"logo_path":null,"name":"JQ Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only You Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
