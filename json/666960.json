While the townspeople are picked off by spiders of varying sizes, two esteemed scientists ramble around the countryside in a late model sedan, where they find friendship, romance and a big mechanical spider built on a Volkswagen Beetle chassis!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ihs9tbzI97kYJNZRYhhYEWh8cK9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RiffTrax Live: Giant Spider Invasion","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
