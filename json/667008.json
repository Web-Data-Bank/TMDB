He may not have broken dramatic new ground in the same way as his musical colleagues Liszt and Wagner, who invented new genres. Instead, his innovations took place at the mircro-level – within music’s inner palm. In this respect Brahms was far ahead of his time – and this fact explains what half a century later Arnold Schoenberg regards him as “progressive” and was referring to him for his own compositional theory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A4NLrjHqquQj11MiHuTYItnBbiZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brahms - Symphonies No. 3 and 4 / Semyon Bychkov, WDR Sinfonieorchester Koln","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
