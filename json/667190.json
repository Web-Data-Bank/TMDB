Far from Paris, in the South of France, his obstinacy as man and artist made him a pioneer of a new way of seeing. Returning always to the same sujets – the Mont Sainte-Victoire, bathing figures, or still lifes – he abandoned central perspective, distorted body-shapes and broke all the traditional rules of landscape painting. Aided by experts, and descendants of the artist, Matthew Collings gives a thorough introduction to Cézanne’s life and work, exploring the lifelong artistic quest of the man whom Picasso called “my only master”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v3Zb64V1iLW2UWXtG30jkspd3Me.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art Lives Series: Paul Cezanne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
