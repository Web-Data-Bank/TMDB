When he retaliates, he is called to the principal's office, but refuses to suffer the consequences of the attack alone, since the aggressor is not responsible for his speech. Inspired by readings about the Black Panthers, the boy decides to stay in school until justice is done. Meanwhile, he exposes the neglect of the establishment's structure with his cell phone. Gradually, colleagues, teachers, directors and even politicians get involved in the conflict that is highlighted in the media.","popularity":1.052,"poster_path":"/vbU8viY4tzm0oO7EJWLaArWHIXz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corte Seco Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bruddah's Mind","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":6}
