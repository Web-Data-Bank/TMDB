Two Interpol agents went to stop their evil plot of world domination, but one of them became a victim of one of the diseases and wanders off acting like a six-year old child. He mindlessly walks into a bullied action film star's mansion, and the star, Jones Bon, was forced to babysit him while dealing with affairs involving his divorced wife and his two daughters.
