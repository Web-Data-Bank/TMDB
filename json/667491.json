The difference between this and any other game are the stakes: human lives. Gortari, the great business mogul and head of the organization, selects individuals with skills in combat and recruits them into the game against their will. For those who observe making their bets, it's an afternoon of entertainment; for the players, it's a bloodthirsty fight to the death where anyone can be the cat or the mouse. Aurelio, one of the strongest players, survived the last game five years before. It will be up to him to become once again a prisoner of the game, or rise up and destroy the organization from its very foundations as he fights against time and the other 14 players.","popularity":1.187,"poster_path":"/6TrqCLNItnWf4MF5bKMlSTXAG3f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Juego","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
