Satan instructs Ballet Master Death to assemble an orchestra of human passions (Fear, Panic, Suspicion, Hatred, Heroism, Murder etc.) to provide the music for a corps de ballet of Nations to perform the dance macabre of war.  What follows is an often-humorous assembly of the orchestra, filmed in the atmospheric cavernous tunnels beneath Bristol Temple Meads.  Following this assembly, we see the core Nations perform their dance, joined by a larger cohort of Nations for the final act, Revenge. The film is interspersed with danced sections performed by a Chorus, evocative of the choric elements of classical Greek tragedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/98oAKt9oot9xVjpKv4cNsemRtkw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128356,"logo_path":null,"name":"impermanence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Billy Zane narrates this 50-minute arthouse film in which war is imagined as a diabolical dance choreographed by Satan and Ballet Master Death.","title":"The Ballet of the Nations","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
