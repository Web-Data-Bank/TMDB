Being and time. That might sound vague, but this is nonetheless what it is. The young teens spend time in summery fields, in desolate, abandoned warehouses and other buildings on the outskirts of a small provincial town in the Argentinian pampas. The same spaces reoccur a few years later when the young women meet again when one of them returns with a backpack symbolising the knowledge acquired.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qUjKcHiDL3wHpNsecUTljIvj0WO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129480,"logo_path":null,"name":"4KL","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Offering","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
