Sparked initially by the government's plans for a controversial extradition bill, the movement has now transformed into a broader push for greater freedoms and democracy, with anger over police brutality fuelling a cycle of violence. The protests are Hong Kong's biggest challenge to Beijing since its return to China in 1997. If We Burn looks at the movement through the eyes of Hong Kongers whose fates, like their city's future, now hang in the balance.","popularity":0.663,"poster_path":"/hfF1eMmV4H1RYbPGFOH3o01FP4C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128671,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lianain Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2020-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":265,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If We Burn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
