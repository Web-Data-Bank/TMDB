Her mother isn't overjoyed about Emilia's return, as this disrupts her peaceful existence. Emilia tries to decide how she wants to carry on with her life, but is confronted with people and feelings from her past. Bored and frustrated, or just looking for intimacy, she seduces a number of men, including her childhood sweetheart, but also falls in love with a girl at the school where she teaches gym – an obsession that distracts her from her broken heart and musings about the future.  In his first feature, director César Sodero contrasts Emilia's inner restlessness with the immutability of Patagonia. He does this using images of impressive landscapes, natural dialogue and telling non-verbal communication. Surrounded by the peace and beauty of nature, inner chaos gradually gives way to acceptance and self-awareness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jrnfSp9UxWXyVn933XzIacKnXtF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64499,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tarea Fina","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emilia","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
