The Alabado House was built in 1671 as part of Quito’s colonial Old City, surviving centuries of earthquakes, poverty and decay. Over the past five years, dozens of manual laborers have been working to restore it. But its miraculous beauty conceals a long and tragic history. For it was the oppressed indigenous masses who built the Old City, the largest in Latin America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/plozDUptNd5v4nuxEBrU6hTgngm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineática Films","origin_country":"EC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2010-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The silent walls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
