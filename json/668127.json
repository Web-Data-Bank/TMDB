It was shot on film (Kodak EXR 7248 as far as I remember) but only ever finished on DV. The sound is mono, recorded entirely where the footage was filmed, and entirely non-sync. There is one tiny audio dropout, where some oxide has dropped-off the now quite old master tape. The SuperSeaCat no longer runs between Newhaven end Dieppe, having been replaced by a much larger ferry, and parts of the land immediately behind the beach are now threatened with industrial development.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3XKAGMfruQRXR6ztKNhfzbCAJXI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tidemills","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
