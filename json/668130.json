I have drawn on footage shot over the past 25 years - some appropriated from commercial resources, some hand-processed - an accumulation of textures which illuminate the film's fabric of memory. A wisteria arbor in bloom collapses under the weight of a late Spring rain, is rebuilt and repeats its cycle. In between occur an arson, flood, earthquake, planting and the harvest. Part 2 reflects on animals' roles in our lives as providers of food, companionship, clothing and sport. I observe the changes around me as I attempt to understand what it means to cultivate a sense of place in time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasonal Forces","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
