The film was shot in the immediate aftermath of violent repression following food riots in Casablanca, June 1981. It characterizes the experience of a political event for people outside of it. The point of view is that of an absurd and sympathetic character based on Jacques Tati’s Mr Hulot, who is distanced from the post-colonial milieu in which he finds himself. (He doesn’t speak the language, he doesn’t speak their language).","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oued Nefifik: A Foreign Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
