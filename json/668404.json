A time filled with changes and emotions; from leaving her parents’ home for the first time and start living by herself to embarking in a world tour that would take her to places like Japan, United States, Asia and Europe.  A crucial time in a young woman's life, who is about to make the big leap…, but is she interested in success or fame? Andrea is not a conventional artist. She lives in the moment, enjoying the small things in life, every day in the most simplest way possible…  An entire magical process that can only be understood through her music.","popularity":0.737,"poster_path":"/r73RnCAMWYfrfAVjJp2DEwCQEEE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Setmàgic Audiovisual","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":26907,"logo_path":null,"name":"divinoconcepto","origin_country":""},{"id":16055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Generalitat de Catalunya - Institut Català de les Empreses Culturals (ICEC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story about the triumph of simplicity","title":"Andrea Motis, The Silent Trumpet","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
