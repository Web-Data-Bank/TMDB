Rebellion films, Snake touches on such themes as institutionalized racism, colonialism and the plight of women of color.  Narrated in the first person by the filmmaker as an epistle to her son, The Snake in My Bed tells Diegu's story as a Nigerian woman in Lagos who is romantically pursed by a German national who has “gone native.” Despite his secretive and duplicitous actions, she eventually agrees to marry him and has his child, only to learn that he is a bigamist with a German wife and child.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10250,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCLA School of Film and Television","origin_country":""},{"id":128516,"logo_path":null,"name":"L.A.
