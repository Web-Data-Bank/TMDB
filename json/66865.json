Alas, even when lady luck smiles at him, the poor player doesn't stand a chance against the worst gold-digger of all: the wife, who 'manually' blames his irresponsible behavior when he looses but otherwise cheerfully claims all his occasional hard-earned winnings for her own fashionable waste.","popularity":0.978,"poster_path":"/ueLwOdF81VHn1JrilX6DGkdryOk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Get Rich Quick","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":19}
