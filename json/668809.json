The subs, after all, were responsible for gravely wounding Japan's industry, all but destroying the Japanese merchant fleet, and therefore preventing reinforcement of Japanese military garrisons. In relaying this story, the program draws on a series of interviews with military veterans, and endless archival footage of naval battles that chronologically tells the gripping story of the Pacific Front of the war.","popularity":0.914,"poster_path":"/4Vw9U6Yy3SI5Os1Y2rblzN6z7y9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Timeless Media Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Victory Submarine Warfare in WWII","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
