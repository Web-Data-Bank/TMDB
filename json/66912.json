The DVD with a running time of almost 2 hours long features 13 new Celtic Thunder performances! After the smash success of the first Celtic Thunder production in 2008, producers Sharon Browne and Phil Coulter have developed an all-new Irish-music showcase. The sharply dressed male vocalists who starred in the first show have returned, and each performer gets a chance to show off his pop sensibility. The energetic set includes traditional Celtic tunes as well as rock covers and original compositions by Coulter.","popularity":0.712,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celtic Thunder: Take Me Home","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
