Mia, 11 and too wise for her age, asks Hugo, 15 and blasé, to tell her about Chaïnes – a girl he spent evenings with at the lake, trying to seduce her. He felt the fear of declaring his love and the torment provoked by the exuberant but secretive Chaïnes, who never shows her emotions. Mia and her siblings surround them, like a choir. A slow, dark, documentary in which time doesn't seem to exist.","popularity":0.755,"poster_path":"/4TQITaNR9mgoLcRMwa2eGfcJr0T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108590,"logo_path":null,"name":"5à 7 Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tender","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":5}
