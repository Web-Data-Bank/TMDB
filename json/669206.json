She was born and grew up among the festivities of the small church of the place, with a burning desire to crown the image of Our Lady. Santa raises the flag against the mining company that explores the site and that in addition to deforesting, threatens with its residues the spring and the waterfall of the place. But she meets Cícero, the mining company's new supervisor and falls in love with him. In “Santa” there is no violence for the sake of gender and sexual difference, because Santa is completely inserted in the social life of the community and is known, respected and loved by everyone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
