His only remaining solace is Tuesday night practice, but with an average age of 74 and suffering a haemorrhaging of the bass section his beloved choir is facing a crisis of its own. So the hunt begins to find ‘brown-haired men’ in their 40s and 50s who can take the choir forward.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rEn2qFT4Gcw5spDuPTKBxaWnYME.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men Who Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
