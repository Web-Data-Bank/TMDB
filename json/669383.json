The Evolution of the Movie Musical","overview":"The movie musical occupies an interesting position in the film industry. On one hand, like action movies, its dance scenes are all about bodies in motion: dynamism, choreography. Yet, with notable exceptions such as Busby Berkeley, those responsible for putting star hoofers on-screen tended to let them strut their considerable stuff uninterrupted. It’s not to say that the camera always remained static; but you could imagine the likes of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, or the gravity-defying Nicholas Brothers, taking it as a personal affront if they weren’t shown full screen, to fully appreciate their elegance, their athleticism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wvNbuwtRxCVR6Hue6vW85xY6bag.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123637,"logo_path":"/dPNGsjB8r8ZyhXkE9DmxM8nh7Rt.png","name":"Sight \u0026 Sound Theatres","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gotta Film Dance!
