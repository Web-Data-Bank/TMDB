Director Pascal Petit collected the testimonies of five parents. All testify and tell how they welcomed the coming out of their child, no one received it as good news. Some reacted more sharply than others and at times in pain, but all moved on and their gaze changed. This documentary tells of the conversion of the way parents look at their children's homosexuality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yUOtijPCze7HwT6IgejaJiBVVuQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phare Ouest Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mon enfant est homo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
