A girl, she hopes. Together with her husband she prepares for this new phase of their parenthood. It means that their son has to go to school, but as an ex-Naxalite that is tough to achieve in contemporary India, where people like them are third-rate citizens. They lack the certificates and an opaque bureaucratic process doesn't help.  Directors Isabella Rinaldi, Cristina Hanes and Arya Rothe of the NoCut Film Collective concentrate on Somi's close family ties, painting a portrait of ex-Naxalites in India. Once, Somi and her husband were communist rebels fighting for the rights of Indian tribes. However, to safeguard their family's welfare, they surrendered to the government in exchange for marginal compensation and simple accommodation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jeGqk4lcb9kLmqHvvT56niRyG1T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128652,"logo_path":null,"name":"NoCut Film Collective","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2020-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Rifle and a Bag","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
