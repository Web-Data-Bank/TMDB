While Yeshi and her older sister were thousands of miles away in a British boarding school, her great-grandfather was deposed by a revolution, setting off a harrowing chain of events that would put her parents and siblings in grave danger.  For the very first time, the royal family examines the events that led to the collapse of a 3,000-year-old dynasty and reflects on how, against all odds, they were able to survive this turbulent time in Ethiopian history.","popularity":2.458,"poster_path":"/l1OTigGM6BTdtfPPIDJNZvecmU0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Constance Marks Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandpa Was An Emperor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
