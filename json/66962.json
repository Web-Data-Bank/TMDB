It paints a poetic and terrifying tableau of the life of Elisabeth d'Aulnières: her marriage to Antoine Tassy, squire of Kamouraska; his violent murder; and her passion for George Nelson, an American doctor. Passionate and evocative, Kamouraska is the timeless story of one woman's destructive commitment to an ideal love.","popularity":0.878,"poster_path":"/jAmwQEfb6ZHMkDBgJdpgmIVLYEf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Carle-Lamy","origin_country":""},{"id":4952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Film Development Corporation (CFDC)","origin_country":""},{"id":10793,"logo_path":null,"name":"France Cinéma Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1973-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kamouraska","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":8}
