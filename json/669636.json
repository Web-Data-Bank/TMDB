The film was made by women who lived in Leeds during the 1970s and early 80s, when a series of murderous sexual attacks by the so-called Yorkshire Ripper led to a virtual ‘curfew on women’. In response, the many women’s groups already active in the area decided it was time to put their own point of view.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8okwewrBkzrRRfZCjmwgfvnLCSy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leeds Animation Workshop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give Us a Smile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
