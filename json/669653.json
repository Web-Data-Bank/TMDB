For over a year, Josef has been leading a precarious life in Venice. He hopes to become an opera composer. The city, full of talented and already-established composers, seems closed to him. Looking for work as a violinist, he comes into the orbit of a rich young woman. Thanks to her, he gets the opportunity to play at salons. But his real opportunity arises when he becomes the lover of a libertine marquise. She teaches him worldly manners, rids him of signs of a provincial upbringing and introduces him to a hedonistic existence free from religious intolerance. Thus transformed, Josef gets an incan incredible commission: to write an opera for the San Carlo, Europe's largest theatre.","popularity":3.066,"poster_path":"/A0FzgVGPMz1jeIBFKRSepCVbBoI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117757,"logo_path":"/qF5tbJOK8ppkY08ESKlGtj6762t.png","name":"Mimesis Film","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":74065,"logo_path":"/2zMkXdiEX16WDRft4ebKqcgAxu0.png","name":"Dugong Films","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":116802,"logo_path":"/pDD11g6xLx1o1u0kP9FSF0DvoM4.png","name":"Sentimentalfilm","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2022-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Boemo","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":8}
