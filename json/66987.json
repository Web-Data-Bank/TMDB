It may appear to be one of the most exciting and glamorous jobs in the world â€“ but being a roadie with a top-rated world-famous rock and roll band can be a grueling marathon of 18 hour work days, on an easy day. A bad is actually a couple of days, 40 hours spent hauling gear, assembling huge stacks of speakers, lifting them a hundred feet in the air, tuning instruments for demanding musicians and being cut off from every lover, friend and relative you have. This series takes you to the show you never see when you take your seat for a concert by the legendary band Rush. All the backstage secrets are revealed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":250,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Backstage Secrets: On the Road with the Rock Band Rush","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
