Carried away by his passion for women and gambling, he goes so far as to commit perjury. A classic revisited by Mesguich with a lot of visual effects: special effects, magic tricks, imposing sets. A playful staging for this tragi-comic play.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zsszVsIae3FpZhgRAQccju89XyA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128740,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coopérative de Production Audiovisuelle Théâtrale","origin_country":""},{"id":145304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miroir et Métaphore","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dom Juan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
