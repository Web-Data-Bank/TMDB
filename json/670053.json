The cultural terms for social analyses and organizing around such issues requires an aggressive capitulation to peculiarly Western Humanist notions of the nuclear family, as well as private and public space. As a result, Feminist and Queer critical rejections of family structures (nuclear and otherwise) are increasingly scarce. An ability to understand the abuses of family and domestic violence as symptoms of larger institutionalized dominations becomes virtually impossible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qEKlzoKX8mO08A0phvgiXXn2iRY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deproduction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
