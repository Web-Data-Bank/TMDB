Sharing the realities of 'true minimalist travel' and a choice to live simply.  A travel adventure with a difference, there’s no luggage!​  Experienced traveller and amateur filmmaker Benjamin Luke Mitchell (Lost Yet Free), explores the possibilities of freedom if one opens up their mind and leaves the backpack behind.  No packing or carrying necessary, the philosophy here is to live simply, without restraints. Our curiosities spur the way, and an ultralight approach allow us to access places and global gifts beyond the reach of a big, heavy sack.  This is a personal quest, an introspective story about a man learning how to confront that continual feeling of bewilderment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gxg1u1GeBOSHFEynDUUHBYacnjG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a choice to live simply.","title":"True Minimalist Travel","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
