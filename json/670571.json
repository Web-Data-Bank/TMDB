As far as Resurreccion goes, it is a semi-historical Drama, based on Leo Tolstoy's novel also titled \"Resurrection\" . However, Solares' movie loosely uses the start of the 1910 to 1920 Mexican Revolution as its cornerstone, (instead of the Russian battle that Tolstoy relied on for his 1899 literary work ). It essentially documents one man's effort to find redemption for his past sins. It stars actors Emilio Tuero, Lupita Tovar, Sara Garcia and Jose Pulido, among others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qfakSQPogDHIzv653JBqduIoErF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1943-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resurrección","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
