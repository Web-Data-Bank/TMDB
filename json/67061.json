The man marries Elena, his girlfriend for years, who has decided to remain a virgin until the wedding day. The man is a great womanizer and is surprised by the revelation, so much so that on the first night he is unable to consummate the relationship. The word soon spread and the mother of the bride, Donna Virginia, urged her son-in-law to apply. Carlo then tries to find a solution before it's too late and his mother-in-law thinks that throwing him into the arms of a professional is the ideal ploy.","popularity":1.451,"poster_path":"/aNKXqWV1jdDOeEGfHfELKkzEbjh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1429,"logo_path":"/n1GvY0KLgk3gcEPO07L7nXncB3i.png","name":"Italian International Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":15868,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medusa Distribuzione","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":35166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Princeps Produzioni Cinematografiche e Televisive","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1970-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lovemakers","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":4}
