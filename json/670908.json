It's a tale as old as time itself. Tijuana Makes Me Happy, which won the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Slamdance Film Festival, is both a charming coming-of-age story and a celebration of the most infamous of all Mexican border towns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1z1dnb0TRf0Vkaj5CmCOcntBJuo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Happiness lies at the bottom of Tijuana.","title":"Tijuana Makes Me Happy","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
