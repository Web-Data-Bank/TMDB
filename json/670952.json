Lee) is a New York City firefighter who barely escaped the World Trade Center on 9/11 and instantly became a hero. Except the only reason he survived was because he panicked and ran away, a secret he kept hidden under PTSD and survivor's guilt. Years later, Samuel Lyons (Carl Ford), a photographer who crossed paths with Gus on 9/11, confronts Gus with a photo that proves Gus was a coward. Samuel blackmails Gus into telling the truth to his family, forcing him into a journey of self-discovery and acceptance which reunites him with his son Frankie (Sebasti√°n Zurita) who enlisted in the military to fight for him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9gs06K4HoJkZYcWhWGRg1vG0DDV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you hit bottom the only way is up.","title":"I Was There","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
