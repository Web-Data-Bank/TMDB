Partly through sincerity and partly prompted by an uneasy conscience, he wants to revolutionize the traditional photo-novel by linking it to social and political reality, to \"bring social conscience to the masses\" by utilizing this traditionally manipulative and alienating mass medium. The film narrates, in a tragicomic tone, the itinerary followed by Gualberto Rodriguez in his efforts to produce his 'revolutionary' photo-novel: the story of a peasant that migrates to the city, becomes a blue-collar worker, tries to establish a union, and ends up falling in love with the factory owner's daughter. The 'revolutionary' ends up being used, manipulated, and his project fails completely.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ihO9IUWE9jLkuxDpTqSGCAgT0nb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cualquier cosa","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
