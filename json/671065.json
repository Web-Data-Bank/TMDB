The youngsters all arrive home for Christmas Eve, and their parents do their utmost to give them a good time, but the thoughtless and selfish children make other plans and go to a party, leaving their parents to a lonely dinner. A member of the common council arrives at the Ingals home and orders Bernard to reinstate a municipal employee who has been dismissed; Bernard refuses and submits his resignation. The grandmother, a strong-minded old lady, then sets out to put things right: she stakes Bernard to his life-long dream, a greenhouse of his own, and then lectures the children on their thoughtless and profligate ways. The children reform and get jobs, and the goose hangs high at last.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2PY6It3e72BleL84wsdlzuO3UsB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Goose Hangs High","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
