We get to follow some aerobics instructors on a crusade against hetero-sexism. Like a homoerotic meeting between Jane Fonda and Ulrike Meinhof. The film encourages and gives suggestions for ways to respond to gender-and hetero-fascists and their constant repetition of for example, are you a guy or girl? A movie for all of us who are faced with sexism, trans / homophobia and guitar guys on everyday occasions and at parties.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1hhLhNJ3TJSbyE2E9SBfYU74avn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moralist Instruction Musical: The Revolutionary Conduct","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
