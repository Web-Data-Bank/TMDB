We hear from the men and women, who built this engineering marvel. Massive tunnel boring machines gnawed their way through rock and chalk, digging not one tunnel but three; two rail tunnels and a service tunnel. This was a project that would be privately financed; not a penny of public money would be spent on the tunnel. Business would have to put up all the money and take all the risks. This was also a project that was blighted by flood, fire, tragic loss of life and financial bust ups. Today, it stands as an engineering triumph and a testament to what can be achieved when two nations, Britain and France put aside their historic differences and work together.","popularity":0.645,"poster_path":"/d9sGAQU4gplhFu0AkMujo4IwYvC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8635,"logo_path":"/sNC3eCDuMbNhRCevAUIYbblJOjO.png","name":"Windfall Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":27856,"logo_path":"/jLMbth7gIW0UMxGqHB5zuHk1iJk.png","name":"Channel 5","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Building the Channel Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
