Donald sends them to wash up; when he finds they've done a half-hearted job, he sends them to bed without supper. They scheme to get food; Donald catches them, but falls off a cliff while chasing them. He's OK, but temporarily out cold. The boys build a fake corpse and dress Donald up as an angel, and he buys it for a while.","popularity":2.402,"poster_path":"/qZUA14BxCAcBAw40LiI80IuD2Ra.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soup's On","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":20}
