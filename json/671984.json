We come to know Hopper as a complex artist, a valuable photographer who had always a camera on him and whose portraits or American life shots figure among the best in the genre, but also a rebel painter (who may still be rediscovered and become famous in posterity) and exquisite art collector.","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/pJcptr7eIngVy31CIilnOUBM27N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dennis Hopper: Create (or Die)","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
