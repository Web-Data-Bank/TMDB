Soon after, small-time investigative journalist Eve Pretson crawls from the wreckage of a burnt out car nearby. She suffers a complete loss of memory - with no recollection of who she is or anything that preceded the accident. Weak and disorientated, she stops at a gas station for help, but instead witnesses the murder of a local mechanic. How are these events connected? In a desperate search for answers, Eve pieces together the scattered fragments of her life, becoming ever more fearful of all she uncovers.","popularity":3.143,"poster_path":"/aOn0oP6cqx1ZgzT9MPF8jJeEeQw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13404,"logo_path":"/4F5RxvJgbVT0vFQHs3IYRPfJvo3.png","name":"Incendo Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reverse Angle","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":10}
