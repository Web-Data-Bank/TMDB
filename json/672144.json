Her father is seldom at home while her stepmother is afraid of her. At school, she dares to confront teachers whom she considers as no good. A young teacher, Wing Ganda, tries to understand her and shows her how to use her talent. His effort is fruitful but Agnes falls in love with him. Wing tries to avoid her. When another young man attempts to approach Agnes, she makes a fool out of him. Agnes has to deal with the fact that she cannot conquer everything. Wing is unconquerable and her stepmother secretly cares about her very much.
