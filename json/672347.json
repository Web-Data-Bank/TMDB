As well as having exclusive access to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, he followed others, including a refugee couple from Syria and a mother whose child was murdered by Golden Dawn. The result is a unique and multiple story-lined film: a tale which evolves and unfolds with the characters over time as they face difficult decisions, even to partially achieve their goals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8HUwHr2lrmsa07USfR1eQd4nZbW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Small planet","origin_country":""},{"id":10946,"logo_path":"/gk4SFkJ3G49gGL308zymD8QGNw.png","name":"WDR/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chained (Agora II)","video":false,"vote_average":7.25,"vote_count":4}
