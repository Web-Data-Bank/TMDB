The title \"island\" is an artificial construct in Tokyo Bay, a mountain of garbage, a by-product of Japan’s economic boom years. The film’s protagonist Alan works there, almost buried under society’s detritus; his growing obsession with the search for “what has been lost” turns him into a \"dangerous\" activist. He targets the industrialist Wada, whose chemical factory secretly discharges toxic waste into the environment. But the cop Terayama, who thought he’d seen it all, starts researching eco-activism and soon suspects the haunted, taciturn young man he’s encountered in the neighborhood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cZ26fxQeNwbeQgGh1ZEr0hAUoia.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nikoniko Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island of Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
