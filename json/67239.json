Into the Fog","overview":"Rip-roaring rock ‘n roll. In 2005 The Black Crowes played a five night gig at The Fillmore in San Francisco. This appears to be a document of the one night they hooked up with the four-man Left Coast Horns (who apparently had only that afternoon to work out arrangements and rehearse with the band). Did they get it together? Fuckin’ A! You have to love a band that walks out on stage and opens up by kicking every ass in the house with a burner like “(Only) Half Way to Everywhere”.","popularity":1.032,"poster_path":"/6yuHlYm5euE7JRGSwgDX86Z8S9B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Crowes - Freak 'n' Roll...
