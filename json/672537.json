The same traveling is repeated, each time in a different way. The recordings, each of which is diagnosis of our ‘present’ in Beirut, constitute as many fragments of history. Is it possible to capture an instant? Aren’t we always beneath or beyond reality? Here, repetition becomes the reflection of a vain desire to capture beauty and at the same time a means of renewal. It reflects on the process of creation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/BeCFhf84Rnb0GiF7ObKy2Ohvu9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
