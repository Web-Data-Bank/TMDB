In the 1970s, such \"festivals\" were incredibly popular in Brazil. They were recorded before a live studio audience, and usually featured a number of elimination rounds. They also formed the springboard for the career of many a big-name star, such as Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Roberto Carlos and Gilberto Gil. Appearing on such a program was no cakewalk, however: audiences could be as wild in their condemnation as in their appreciation of an artist. Extensive archive footage (including performances and behind-the-scenes interviews) from a turbulent final of the Festival of Brazilian Popular Music one evening in 1967 paints a fascinating picture, not only of the transformation of Brazilian music into real \"festival\" music, but also of a society starting to buck against the yoke of military rule.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uI4qingWiqISJvU5ZMPX79RHTK0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":346,"logo_path":"/kzQAFe6cBI0cbHZP3lUiHmeEyAF.png","name":"Videofilmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2010-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary which shows the greatness in the Festival de Música Popular Brasileira of 1967.","title":"A Night in 67","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":8}
