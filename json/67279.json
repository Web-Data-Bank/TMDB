BattleGround is an irreverent journey that will challenge the orthodoxies of Left and Right, and highlight the humanity of all sides of the conflict. BattleGround will be a critical film for anyone who wants to understand the powerful forces that are sucking America deeper and deeper into a Middle Eastern quagmire. Is Iraq our generation's \"Bright Shining Lie,\" or is it the frontline in a global battle for national survival? Or is to some combination of both?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xkIhbrab0Qt9va7vh8LtTB5DwvI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BattleGround: 21 Days on the Empire's Edge","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
