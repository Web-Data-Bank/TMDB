An exorcist and inquisitor of the Vatican appears in the monastery to make ominous investigations. It is about the biggest secret of the Vatican: The Pope has a daughter! The unwanted child was once the result of a brief affair with a nun.  The Inquisitor has been ordered to kill the Pope's daughter, who is now an adult, in order to eliminate the only evidence of the scandal. But while assassinating the unsuspecting young woman, the killer falls in love with his victim. This surprising turn of events is the starting point for an exchange of blows that is as hair-raising as it is bloody.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gP0bp3WMWbUcBFekkGEkZQRwLsD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Busch Media Group","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":14552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Al!ve AG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Papsttochter","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":2}
