To penetrate these organizations and gain access to their inner circles the police need a magic bullet. Alex Caine is that magic bullet. Only thirty years old, Alex, who grew up hard on the mean streets of Montreal, already brings a lifetime’s worth of experience (foster care, military service, prison time) to the world’s most dangerous occupation: professional gang infiltrator. It is his job to befriend criminals, participate in their illegal activities, gather evidence – then live long enough to testify against them in court.","popularity":0.713,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7224,"logo_path":"/aEB2TV6TTolC7NSwonWIb25MKga.png","name":"Shaw Media","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":7225,"logo_path":"/qcGIZjdRc1YOJPyWhBj9L2Rf3q9.png","name":"DHX Media","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Infiltrating the Hells Angels, Bandidos, and Other Criminal Brotherhoods","title":"Befriend and Betray","video":false,"vote_average":2.9,"vote_count":4}
