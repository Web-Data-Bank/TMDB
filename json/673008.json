His work has inspired and guided generations of directors, and represents a sharp and merciless exploration of human nature which is entirely unique. When he decided to retire from filmmaking after \"Insect\" (2018), his producer suggested that the creative processes which ferment within their company Athanor should be preserved on film. Over three years, the directors of this documentary followed the life of Jan Svankmajer, elucidating his artistic principles, as well as his collaboration with old friend and producer Jaromír Kallista. The film is also haunted by the memory of Eva Svankmajerová, his wife and creative partner, muse and inseparable other half. Playful and poetic, candid and with a touch of Czech humour, it is an ode to creation and to companionship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aE22qdpQ5d0gyH0uCTFSIoeo0mt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79194,"logo_path":"/8oMbGTDI42i6v4e11AjHcgJHp73.png","name":"PubRes","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":130657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antiqua Praga","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2020-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alchemical Furnace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
