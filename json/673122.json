They were fleeing misery, war and repression. Left to unscrupulous smugglers, they had to cross the Iberian Peninsula tracked by the Portuguese and Spanish police. For many, the voyage towards France turned into a disaster. As a child in a shantytown, the author remembers having heard about these terrible odysseys. Thirty years later, he goes in search of the stories of his childhood and seeks to understand what sparked this unprecedented emigration known as the \"plebiscite by foot\" against Salazar. Between childhood memories and historical investigation, he looks for the images of this exodus, the largest in post-war Europe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cy7TVArMwv0koZqHLCxd3Y3IyQk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16475,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animais","origin_country":""},{"id":10767,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Huit Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La photo déchirée, chronique d'une émigration clandestine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
