As the tale unfolds, Jason accidentally shoots his corrupt partner, Leon, grabbing stolen money from the crime scene at the older policeman's urging. The guilt-ridden young man quickly takes to the road to track down Leon's lover, Linda/Shen Li, an illegal Chinese immigrant, to deliver the bag of cash to her. Jason's search takes in seedy motels and rough bars, an L.A. massage parlor and a Nevada ranch, until finally in a dingy Vegas dive, he discovers the irresistible Linda, a sparkling jewel ensnared by the sex trade. Stalked by thugs, the money's \"rightful owners\", Jason and Linda are thrust together to make their escape through the haunting landscape that is the California desert.","popularity":0.932,"poster_path":"/iztcT4MVu13fVg3TiWsvDDd80Er.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
