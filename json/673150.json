This video diptych creates an incredible imagery, colours and the sensual quality of water are presented vividly, just like in an old master painting. Viewers find themselves in a transcendental atmosphere; through the slow pace, the large but still intimate size and the exclusion of any sound, Viola creates a truly fascinating artwork with a powerful visual effect. It seeks to engage the viewer in a visceral and emotional experience that goes to the roots of the human condition and its spiritual sources.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/66KtqkrHRWoKIRSk7bLD2w1Xxgh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Basin of Tears","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
