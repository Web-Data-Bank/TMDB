There’s an interesting kind of resonance that I see between this idea of a formula for salvation and eternal life and the promise of digital media that never break down and literally can live forever...that can always be copied endlessly. In a way, the medium itself represents a kind of promise that almost has spiritual overtones.\"\r - Paul Pfeiffer","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John 3:16","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
