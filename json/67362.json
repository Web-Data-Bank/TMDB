He left the assassination business to live the \"easy life.\" However, retirement arrived with its own agenda. It was not the instant peace and calm that Price expected. Rather, it was emptiness, boredom, and, worst of all, restlessness. The Last Lullaby plummets Price back into his old life and forces him into a corner from which he may never escape. Price's old ways no longer work for him when his heart opens, and he finds life beyond his profession. The tension finally boils, as Price must decide to close himself off again or open himself up to a world beyond his control.","popularity":2.625,"poster_path":"/swRE5twrHEXF7FKaQkkbNGLEHkP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Timbergrove Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":59484,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chaillot Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There comes a time in your life when you want to be exactly who you are.","title":"The Last Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8}
