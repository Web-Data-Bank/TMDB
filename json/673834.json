As popular as America’s World Series, the stakes are beyond high in this single-elimination tournament. For Coach Mizutani, cleaning the grounds and greeting guests are equally important as honing baseball skills, however, demonstrating discipline, sacrifice and unwavering dedication. Director Ema Ryan Yamazaki follows Mizutani and his team on their quest to win the 100th annual Koshien, and, in the process, goes beyond baseball to reveal the heart of the Japanese national character.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":"/mfoT4DbRz9R9xyScv9NCmAd4ucE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beyond the sweat and tears of Japan's 100th high school baseball tournament, a national obsession at the center of its struggle to raise the next generation of successful adults.","title":"Koshien: Japan's Field of Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
