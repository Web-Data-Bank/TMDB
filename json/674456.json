It is in this setting that Sylvia Kamutjemo (Girley Charlene Jazama, who also produces), a black domestic worker, meets Afrikaner police officer Pieter de Wet (Jan-Barend Scheepers) on a routine passbook check. As the pair exchange letters and a story of forbidden love across racial lines unfolds, Kahikopo explores an underrepresented period of Namibian history with compassion and hope.","popularity":0.635,"poster_path":"/h5QMxaGEXrUV1CUpIkiR4gIsvpa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NA","name":"Namibia"}],"release_date":"2020-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The White Line","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
