When the Nazis occupied Crimea, the actors of the drama theater of the city of Simferopol entered the underground group Sokol. The activities of the underground members were diverse: they put up leaflets with information from Soviet Information Bureau, compiled maps showing the strategic objects of the enemy, and supplied the partisans with medicines.  On April 10, 1944, 3 days before the liberation of Simferopol, the underground members died from enemy bullets — they were shot on the outskirts of the city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vOunCfl3tgGmkKE9f8FyfKHZqIr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1981-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Were Actors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
