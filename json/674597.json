I trained my lens on to the city skyline and began shooting. At the end of the 100ft roll, I back winded the film to the beginning of the roll. I then re photographed the skyline from a slightly different angle and blended the two exposures with my hand. I then printed the section 4 times and gave each section its own treatment , each section becomes its own part. a portrait of a city â€“ a City in Four Parts.  -JB","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n0tCAvHFWLr86EjH5HtfFTzBkbo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A City in Four Parts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
