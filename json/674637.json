I returned on my own, in July 2014, to continue ongoing research and begin development on a new project based specifically in Pyramiden. The goal of this fourteen-day expedition was to conceptually recreate and capture the last moments of Pyramiden before its residents hastily evacuated, as well as to document and interpret the rich narrative of remaining artifacts left behind before they are looted or destroyed. The result of this project is Bardo, a twelve-minute film that imagines the final movement of objects as remnants of a fleeing population, succinctly captured within the abandoned spaces throughout the village. The soundtrack was created on the world's northernmost 'Red October' grand piano.","popularity":0.625,"poster_path":"/ubVjAkySq4WeAAu3s3LRvFpAKrA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SJ","name":"Svalbard & Jan Mayen Islands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bardo","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
