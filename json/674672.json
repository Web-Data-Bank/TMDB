It's a look at \"what could go wrong, that did go wrong.\" In this 90-minute mockumentary, Orange County Crazies founder Cherie Kerr finds herself in the middle of the most stressful production of her 40-year career. It starts with the first table read and takes the audience to the final curtain--the last night of the run.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Show Can't Go On","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
