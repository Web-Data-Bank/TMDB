Using the newest For the Strength of Youth pamphlet, John Bytheway outlines the standards in a direct honest and clear fashion, yet he delivers the message in such a way that youth and adults alike don't feel lectured or preached to, but motivated and excited to live their lives on a higher plane.  Also included on the DVD is a fun “mini-concert” featuring some of John Bytheway's guitar playing and Primary song parodies including his rousing version of “Popcorn Popping” and “Choose the Sprite.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jLOK4WLqo2hIP7CzaSkz2nteWYJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deseret Book","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Standards Night Live","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
