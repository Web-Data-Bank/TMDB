Now, as the prophecy comes true upon the Kingâ€™s death, the villagers brace for an orgy of blood. Living in a destroyed castle not far from the village are Frank and Zed, a Frankenstein-type monster and his brain-eating companion. As the villagers prepare for their impending doom, the two monsters are pulled into a war of epic, puppet-mutilating proportions. This debut feature film by Jesse Blanchard is a hilarious tale of misguided fears, innocent brain consumption, and a loving friendship.","popularity":2.596,"poster_path":"/xS9n3JuaVup4dBzUw6sjZOMezMz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Puppetcore Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frank & Zed","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
