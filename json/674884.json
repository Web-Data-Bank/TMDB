Over the course of a year, we follow the weekly meetings and get close to Kimmy, Nicky, Peter, Nora, Nolan, and Mikayla and their close companion: grief. It is sometimes heartbreaking, but also humorous, to experience the questions about life and death through their open and curious minds.  Grief is high and heavy as a mountain, but it helps you understand what has happened, and that death is irreversible.","popularity":1.171,"poster_path":"/aln11M4yhyF4PM6sjR5JNuon3Wi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88293,"logo_path":"/q4uunfEJRQhTfzFdAFfC6zMvqPo.png","name":"Good Company Pictures","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":147938,"logo_path":"/5USotp1QuLWIHaJM4p6ODbuTB40.png","name":"MTV Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beautiful Something Left Behind","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
