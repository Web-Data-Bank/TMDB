It's a question that haunts Walt (Jim Tavar√©), the owner of Essential Music, an indie record store in the heart of Silver Lake. Walt's all too aware of how his punk-rock glory days are fast fading in the rear-view - even as he can't help recounting war stories to his much younger employees: Lysette (Kate Dalton), who has to contend with a parade of customers convinced she's the Record Store Girl of their dreams; Chris (Derek James Elstro), the lead singer of Troubled Meats, a band poised for takeoff, and maybe not just in Chris' mind; and well-meaning music nut Duane (Adam Weber), who's a little too fluent in Rock Critic for his own good. With a love of all types of music evident in every shot, WARMED-OVER KRAUTROCK is a comedy for anyone who's ever spent too much time obsessing over playlists - and for anyone who's ever been driven crazy by that type of person, too.","popularity":0.612,"poster_path":"/e9sZQ7s4rwG0ItjLLPKnXXvVVY2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warmed-Over Krautrock","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
