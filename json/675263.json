Filmed over one extraordinary year, it’s a story of low politics, high ambition and bitter personal animosities – at stake the biggest decision the UK has taken for decades. Can the prime minister tame the judges, the opposition and finally the public to deliver Brexit? One thing everyone involved agrees on, get this wrong and, ‘we will see another even bigger seismic change in this country’s politics’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mnX8hJ117XVZy6dny8GHMLr4EdC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57317,"logo_path":"/3vol4eJ6YPMULoVJrLvixfdbyVe.png","name":"Ventana Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":51008,"logo_path":"/d7PQ3u8dC63WGhzOhXS4YL3O7ty.png","name":"Oxford Film and Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brexit Means Brexit: The Unofficial Version","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
