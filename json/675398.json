Wannabes and trends are the target of his programme, he dissects them without regard for losses as passionately as unabashedly and does not stop at his audience in the process. Is brunch a man's job? Meat or vegetables? Single or in a relationship? Which dating portal? Harry G answers all these questions and many more openly, honestly and... very subjective. If you think you're cool because you own rollerblades, run to theme parties in white clothes or post your food on Facebook, you're wrong: Here he will be proven wrong.","popularity":1.011,"poster_path":"/6iO5M7wWUzQIDAfjpD8iMvT2yii.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harry G - #HarrydieEhre","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
