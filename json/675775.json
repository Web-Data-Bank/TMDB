The pageant is about commercialism and sexual politics, about big business and small towns. But beyond the symbolism lies a human story—at once moving, inspiring, infuriating, funny, and poignant.  Combining rare archival footage, with a host of intimate interviews with distinguished commentators including Gloria Steinem, Margaret Cho, Isaac Mizrahi, former contestants and behind–the–scenes footage and photographs, the film reveals why some women took part in the fledgling event and why others briefly rejected it - how the pageant became a battle ground and a barometer for the changing position of women in society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gJnSQA9g8VfVSPsIsPNdyEZXszK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clio TV","origin_country":""},{"id":100220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doug Orchard Films","origin_country":""},{"id":129528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visualizing History","origin_country":""},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
