The movement was initially videoed with a phone, the sound recorded on a good deck.  The video was then analyzed carefully frame by frame, and converted to a movement score that was then performed by a dancer and a homemade camera.  In this process it becomes something other, refracted through multiple layers of interpretation, its calm insistence full of a sense of meaning that finally passes without ever having revealed more than the enigmatic gesture itself.  Shot with a homemade pinhole camera onto homemade emulsion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nxewILxWWIZLTynW9MbuXke16qz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Signals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
