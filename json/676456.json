With millions sympathetic to his goal, Rizvi silences anyone attempting to change the law by condemning them to death. As he pushes for more power, Rizvi decides to run for office in the upcoming general elections, and those accused of blasphemy or those who oppose the blasphemy laws- whether targeted minorities, liberals, and opposing Muslim voices - become the pawns of his ambition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ms4tznT4tt98JFltLt6nL6xSXV5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80625,"logo_path":"/daJWIUoMzMWflmcerIoUpLWA38F.png","name":"Brook Lapping Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":129614,"logo_path":null,"name":"64th Street Media Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Accused : Damned or Devoted?","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
