A self-taught camerawoman who began her career documenting community issues in Tottenham, D. Elmina Davis was a Rastafarian herself and had travelled extensively in Africa and the Caribbean. Poetry, mythology, archive footage, interviews, music and dance are skilfully folded into her film’s narrative, revealing the journey to higher consciousness for Jamaican and British Rastafarian women. Interviewees include Judy Mowatt, reggae solo artist and a member of Bob Marley’s backing trio, The I Three.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wb0yoYNyJi8vPVcCBUzL3VHjoVy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ceddo Film and Video Workshop","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Omega Rising Women of Rastafari","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
