The child's mother explains that they have no money, and so she cannot buy any oranges. The dog is then packed up along with a box full of other toys to be sold, but it soon winds up in the street. The dog picks up an orange from a curb side stand, and hopes to take it home to the child. But that night, before the dog can get back to the child's home, it must face a series of strange and frightening adventures.","popularity":1.674,"poster_path":"/ntOnxz6FNfLrE74NbYNasM3mNgz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gelma-Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1933-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mascot","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":30}
