A girl's doll carriage rolls toward a busy street while her father ignores her to talk to a friend; an impatient husband waits for his wife to cook his egg; lovers enjoy a last embrace as a man – her husband? – climbs the stairs. The friends part and the father looks for his daughter; the egg timer rings; the husband returns. Five minutes are almost up, but little is as we expect it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2000-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Be Continued...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
