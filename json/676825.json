This is the last show we did way back in 2017, and we did it at Omaha's cool rock venue The Waiting Room Lounge. This isn't Netflix special-quality (Travis shot it on a camcorder and a GoPro) but it was an awesome show and we wanted to share it with our Patreon friends. Enjoy, and hail yourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y2cNVEr7w00bA72ZJj2WYuRejH5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Podcast on the Left: Live in Omaha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
