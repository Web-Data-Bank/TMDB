One day, a woman named Tasha comes to his church seeking for help. Pastor Joe sits down with her and she shares an intense life story. She shares how she was born, how she was set free from a world of drugs, racism, theft, and human trafficking. Her story becomes increasingly complex as people from her past come in contact with Pastor Joe with their own life struggles of suicide, teen pregnancy, and abortion. As their stories tie together it brings hope, redemption, and salvation to the forefront and gives us a picture of what it means to experience the transformation of God, going from darkness to light, and to continue on the narrow path each and every day.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":"/lQClPQeWgpBibEtXjP9K1PhjZKd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Strong Foundation Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Am I?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
