Its title, 'Local Knowledge', is marine terminology for what a skipper must know when navigating dangerous waters. Rimmer is an experienced sailor and the film's spiritual and geographical center is aptly named Storm Bay, where he spends his summers. But it's a troubled site. The camera, moving with tide and swell, seems to strain anxiously at its anchor and it becomes clear from here on in nothing will ever be at rest. Local Knowledge won't save anyone anymore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gHPEbKbpfzdr73TUzIS8idQcqky.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Local Knowledge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
