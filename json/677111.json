Thanks to Jean-Louis Debré's presence, Claude Chirac and some of Jacques Chirac's closest friends, famous or unknown, agreed to talk to the camera, sometimes for the first time, to evoke their untold-before memories and tell about the moments that bonded the two men for a lifetime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8OhvR7mXl58No4jsS2ZPUyguB7b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127436,"logo_path":"/85hn0WZVj2wpm7scTkrQz76lKJ7.png","name":"LCP - Assemblée nationale","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":90133,"logo_path":"/kp7mjMDGfxqSOSrS3OlRBLwltMp.png","name":"Troisième Œil Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":116072,"logo_path":"/nYlhTsWSUH2g8l9386EyEjEYFwy.png","name":"Histoire TV","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mon Chirac","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
