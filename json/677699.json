Produced by Vietnam Feature Film Studio, it won the B prize of the Vietnam Cinema Association in 1995 for the feature film category. It tells the story of an old man and his wife Da Trang, who live in a coastal village because of their benevolent deeds, so he was given two precious gems by the animals. Thanks to the jade, he could understand the sound of birds and go down to the palace of King Thuy Te under the sea easily. But his wife Da Trang has a pragmatic and gluttonous mind. She not only wanted to get rich, but also wanted to be the queen of the aquarium and had to pay for her treachery when King Thuy Te used a trick to steal the pearl...  This adaptation by Nguyen Thi Hong Ngat respects the content of fairy tales as much as possible, the only difference is that the person who turns into a wild child is the wife, not the woman. The husband is like a well-known version of the legend of a child.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wZhMF262EL8VRUhemPOkdMIzDQn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dã Tràng Xe Cát Biển Đông","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
