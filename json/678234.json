The mountains of Donegal are depicted like fairytale characters, where the hero Mount Errigal competes with neighbouring villain Mount Muckish. A fantastical narrative explains that the landscape is ‘a battleground where the weapons are the elements themselves’. Dramatic footage of storms and lightning blends with a superb score by Irish composer Brian Boydell.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Akr7JNR0S5CYtqKwSg09aFW1kut.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aengus Films","origin_country":""},{"id":178058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roinn Na Gaeltachta","origin_country":""},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1970-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Errigal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
