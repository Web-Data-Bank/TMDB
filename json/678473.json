'A musician must make affirmations,' says Davis. 'If a musician cannot believe in music as a universal ideal, what is he left with? We may be encircled by gloom but music gives us a chance to throw what Meredith calls \"that faint thin line upon the shore\". ... Beethoven is a man at war with himself but a man who is determined to win.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mctykZoeVeNuUckkeaQ3g4hsyPX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven: Missa Solemnis - Sir Colin Davis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
