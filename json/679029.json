Wehrmacht soldiers are settled at the French border. Uneventful days pass by and the soldiers are getting increasingly relaxed on their duty. Except of Hans, the rookie of the group who takes his duty very seriously. He left his comfortable home with noble but naive beliefs about the army and now has to deal with a different reality. Hans' only friend is Peter, a simple but nice butcher’s son. One evening, a lot of stolen alcohol and women’s clothes brings some distraction to the soldiers. They dress up as women and organize a show.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der schöne Hans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
