Tornado unfolds in three movements: waiting for the storms, pursuing them, and catching or missing them. Depicting a one-on-one challenge of the power of nature, the work is a recognition of human persistence, emphasizing the necessity of pursuing ideals however unattainable or absurd they may seem. It is also a reflection on the present chaotic state of Mexico and a study of the search for a moment of order within it; scientifically speaking, tornadoes are instances of order emerging from chaos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kPPQQ1AdvLXhd8too4V13mYr1w5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tornado","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
