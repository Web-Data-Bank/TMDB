The burly bunch are Michael (John Alderman), David (Tom Basham), Henry (Bob Bihiller), Arnold (Bruce Kimbal), Eddie (Henry Olek) and Ronnie (Maurice Warfield). They're deceptive: although they look like the adventure addicted non-conformists of today out to raise Hell as they brawl their way over countryside and local towns, actually the six are on a different type of trip to the City of the Angels.","popularity":1.007,"poster_path":"/xg70nr3GoWlHyWUOYzAS2pBjv56.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7050,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plateau Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1009,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crown International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Catch the Pink Angels ... if you can!","title":"Pink Angels","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
