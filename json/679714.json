A tale about an upswing and downfall, with the climax appearing concurrently and unexpectedly. The hermetical life of artists, who are enclosed into their own world of ideas, striving to create the epochal masterpiece. Even if they succeed, the image they create is the reflection of themselves. And with the same fervor, they repeat the process in endless cycles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nnYsjR6NiuIsh9GY59XnzdBOC5z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129936,"logo_path":null,"name":"To Blink Studio","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":129944,"logo_path":null,"name":"To Blink Animation","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":82871,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmski centar Srbije","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2011-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Minutes Each","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
