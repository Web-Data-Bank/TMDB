Soon tap water was running brown, people were falling ill and it was clear that something was seriously wrong. Anthony Baxter (You’ve Been Trumped) has followed the situation over six years of denial, evasion, betrayal and hypocrisy in which the city’s poorest residents have suffered the most. The result is shocking and sad as it illuminates the inequalities of the modern world and celebrates the solidarity of ordinary people.","popularity":2.364,"poster_path":"/41S1maqJs2OA5pgG5TdXBuolpcN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montrose Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8087,"logo_path":"/54EcBNvIolJDr4OHFACvTHJK2Q0.png","name":"Creative Scotland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":23034,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flint","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
