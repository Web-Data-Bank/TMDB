A story about a chance late-night encounter between a steward and a passenger on a train interweaves with documentary interviews with historians and writers and historical documents brought to life. The tape poses nagging questions about the personal and political stakes in the writing of history and in our interpretations of the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a2HWvCP76KYV1hZZQ99TnKY37G0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129967,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fungus Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dirty Laundry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
