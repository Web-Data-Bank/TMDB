While some parts of the varied montage traverse along with contemporary political issues, other parts blend fictional and documentary narratives to spawn a meaningless tale of a city and its fathomless vigor. This film failingly tries to construct a narrative out of small, disjointed and unassociated clips; yet, this failure itself is imbued with sporadic instances of political statements.","popularity":0.853,"poster_path":"/1cbXrcqMZjmUhdiE8OIaKbBTIBn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"A story?
