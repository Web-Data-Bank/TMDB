Hardly a laugh a minute you might think, but Newman has managed to pepper this unlikely comic dish with the endearing gags that made him famous.","popularity":1.168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"500 Years of Humanitarian Intervention","title":"From Caliban To The Taliban","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
