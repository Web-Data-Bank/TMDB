Claudio is 15 and someone is writing on his forehead “J’ador” because he smells girlish. That’s Lauro, the 18-year-old leader of a group of youngsters that call themselves fascists and do a lot of things for a far-right political party. Claudio wants to go with them to the “dinner” organized by the party section, but one can only attend if he’s part of the group, and cry-babies are not allowed. If he wants to achieve what he wants, in just one afternoon Claudio has to lose his baby scent and start to smell like a man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uAE4EkylPyIBH7O6t5ZC9VNkwAO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51341,"logo_path":null,"name":"CSC Production","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J'ador","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
