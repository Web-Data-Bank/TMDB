The film takes us back to the beginning of time, where Old Man begins to create the world out of a handful of mud. Everything he creates is new and nameless, and affects the rest of the world. Even feelings and desires are unknown and when they emerge, the world becomes more and more complicated.","popularity":0.88,"poster_path":"/itvtAiuMOzCBzJ69okk3CyaV75T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemon Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":113630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Batelières Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2023-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Souls of Coyote","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
