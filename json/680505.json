She came to prominence in 1978, aged 19, when she topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks with her debut single \"Wuthering Heights\", becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number one with a self-written song.  On 12 May 1978, the Dutch broadcaster TROS broadcast a 20 minute Kate Bush television special, recorded at the Dutch amusement park Efteling. On 10 May 1978, Efteling was ready to open the Haunted Castle, the most expensive attraction it had ever constructed, and they wanted to promote it as much as they could. In April a documentary featuring the Haunted Castle was made by filmmaker Rien van Wijk, who was eager to shoot in the latest attraction before it officially opened. Kate, who just had a big hit with Wuthering Heights, was approached for a television special that would promote both Efteling and her songs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fnAgivX4iLyZ9IuAJ0H8WDvn2sg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15163,"logo_path":"/75gxbqZaUTVrIqRSAhCmWSCgH2w.png","name":"AVRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1978-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kate Bush - Efteling Special","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
