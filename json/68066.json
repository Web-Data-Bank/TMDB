Citizen.","overview":"Michael McDonald (MADtv, Austin Powers, Kathy Griffin – My Life on the D-List) returns home to Orange County for his debut stand-up comedy special: MODEL. CITIZEN. In this hilarious, one-hour performance, Michael shares his views on a variety of topics from fame to family and gives the audience a peek at the seemingly normal person behind the whacked out personae he has developed for television (including his famous role as Stuart the baby). Part stand-up comedy, part one man show, this special is for anyone who – like Michael – finds humor in the strange world all around us.","popularity":1.516,"poster_path":"/vNtZqnft65jvC4EI4UrRC6Wnn3K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael McDonald: Model.
