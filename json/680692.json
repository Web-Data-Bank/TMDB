Anita isn’t compatible, and neither is Tonino, her grandfather shepherd who lives in the nearby tableland, close to a military base which affect the area since the Sixties. There is uncle Gaetano: being Jacopo’s brother the probability that he is compatible is higher, but Gaetano is a hothead and he and Jacopo haven’t had any relationship at all: an old grudge, which they don’t want to forget, is keeping them apart.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/7Xv2uwLpgu0Po3jd6ToJIo3qMtW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102339,"logo_path":null,"name":"Articolture","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":115211,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAT Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lamb","video":false,"vote_average":7.455,"vote_count":11}
