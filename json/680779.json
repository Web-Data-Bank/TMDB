Начало","overview":"1980, the whole country follows the events of the Moscow Olympics. Vova Rubinstein alone, on the sly, disguises himself as Soviet pop stars and tries to get rich by arranging fake concerts. At one of these concerts, he is exposed by the KGB and recruited as an undercover agent. Now, in order not to go to jail, Vova must fulfill a responsible mission - to find a deadly chemical developed in a secret laboratory on the black market. Vova will have to plunge headlong into the abyss of the spy passions of Moscow in the 80s: to find a chemical, to prevent the undermining of the Olympic Bear, to experience Brezhnev's passionate kiss, and to meet the love of his life ... And all this is in the image of the currency prostitute Louise Karpovna Rubinstein.","popularity":1.739,"poster_path":"/5rX2Dp86SMIKPehuwsNHTidHggg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naughty Grandma 3","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":7}
