She spent several weeks in a hospital laundrette, poultry house, cash register or waste sorting facility. Her experience became the basis of a lived and very personal report of invisible employees working in appalling conditions. Uhlová wrote a series of reports on her project that were published on the Alarm website. Apolena Rychlíková made them into a documentary film consisting of scenes shot at Uhlová's home and video footage taken during her work. Uhlová accompanies the picture with read commentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8tFdpTcgeAlWxCK8hvVGFWv5OzS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Limits of Work","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
