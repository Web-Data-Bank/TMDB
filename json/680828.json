The couple joins other migrants traveling to safer havens via carefully guarded doors. Through one door, they wind up in a crowded camp on the Greek Island of Mykonos. Through another, they secure a private room in an abandoned London mansion populated mostly by displaced Nigerians. A third door takes them to California’s Marin County. In each location, their relationship is tested by their struggle to find food, adequate shelter and a sense of belonging among emigrant communities. The allegorical tale shows the contrast between the migrants’ tenuous daily reality and that of the privileged native population who’d prefer that they disappear.","popularity":0.679,"poster_path":"/1L6qu81xAfSH8lBLD5QzeGgBjQ2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106544,"logo_path":"/psd84iF7PTGrKf4yFOStKj8JbAh.png","name":"AGBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":122147,"logo_path":"/eotra9uY7zyivEzDL4bFdn7Elm4.png","name":"Higher Ground Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Exit West","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
