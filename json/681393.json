Her legendary banana belt dance created theatre history; her song \"J'ai deux amours\" became a classic, and her hymn.  The film focuses on her life and work from a perspective that analyses images of Black people in popular culture. It portrays the artist in the mirror of European colonial cliches and presents her as a resistance fighter, an ambulance driver during WWII, and an outspoken activist against racial discrimination involved in the worldwide Black Consciousness movement of the 20th century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kQchDKOuJ77cumc06HQcNyKyGUv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Josephine Baker: Black Diva in a White Man's World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
