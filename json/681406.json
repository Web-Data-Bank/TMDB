And ultimately that's who Pirate Radio is for -- for fans who love Hynde, warts and all. It's for the fans who believe that, despite (or perhaps because of) the peaks and valleys, she is indeed how Nick Lowe describes her: \"she's still the same girl we were all in love with nearly 30 years ago...and Chrissie's still the coolest girl in the world.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xKfKuQwltCE71x8QmywQmDvSChh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Media","origin_country":""},{"id":6794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Music","origin_country":""},{"id":20358,"logo_path":"/jPZ0jwLGGELbSxKoUrJzOytNpnp.png","name":"RHI Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pretenders: Pirate Radio (1979-2005)","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
