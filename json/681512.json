The project's subtitle was \"about children, for adults\". In keeping with Ensemble 96's main focus, KIND presents modern Norwegian and Nordic choral music. Per Nørgård and Jaakko Mäntyjärvi are already considered classics by a rapidly increasing audience, while Marcus Paus represents a younger generation of Norwegian composers with a growing interest in the choral medium. The more recent works on the disc set texts all of which have a certain melancholy, fear or unrest linked to childhood. The folk songs are a brave attempt to offer consolation in a remorseless world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vLsINcEFJ3WT78J8z2TWWadzhxa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KIND","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
