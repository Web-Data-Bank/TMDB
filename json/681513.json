Even though they have chosen very different instruments, and are also quite different personalities in many ways, they have a fundamental musical rapport and understanding and also have many other things in common. They both originate from musical families; born and raised in Telemark, a region of Norway rich in folk-music, they have always had an open mind and taken keen interest in various contemporary and popular musical styles and idioms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9QWqxPE9hUbXtrwWUUjQzlY6DMr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sigmund Groven & Iver Kleive: harmOrgan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
