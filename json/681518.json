The path to fame was indeed uphill for Norway's leading modernist. However, Valen's diffidence was not the only reason for this - another was his chosen musical language, which grew out of the twelve-tone method of composition associated with Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. By writing this sort of music, albeit with his own highly personal stamp, he was asking for trouble in the conservative world of Norwegian music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5cp3O8DHZ49iQInFReljzla90RQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fartein Valen string quartets","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
