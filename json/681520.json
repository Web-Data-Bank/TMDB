Both Johannes Brahms and Camille Saint-Saëns were friends of Grieg, and in several of his works the inspiration Grieg gained from his colleagues in Vienna and Paris is easy to hear. In between the works of Brahms and Saint-Saëns the Dena Piano Duo play two Norwegian works they have commissioned from the composers Wolfgang Plagge and Terje Bjørklund with this recording in mind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gJeXAGKShcw7mvEYnYJs69Qxb2h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hommage à Grieg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
