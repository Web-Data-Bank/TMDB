Allow yourself to be moved by Nidaros Cathedral Choir, Sarah Head and the musicians in their presentation of Dyrud's dramatic music. The work is not a passion in the traditional sense, since it does not end with Christ's death. Out of Darkness continues through the kingdom of death and out of the grave, leaving us with the gospel of love that overcomes and endures everything, a gospel of grace and forgiveness. Life is the light of mankind, and we can rise out of the darkness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p8Xb8jNlVIdaAP130BQFZSh5kBp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Darkness - Torbjørn Dyrud","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
