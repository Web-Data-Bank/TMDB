The issues of immigration and demographic change top the list of issues most important to Britons. Based on UK census data, the UK government estimates that White British people will be a minority (less than 50% of the population) by approximately the year 2060. We wanted to know what people think of this, so we went out to several major centres in England to survey over 2000 people about this very topic. This website is a companion reference to our documentary, We Were Never Asked, which can also be found here.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Were Never Asked","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
