Spiraling out from there, the story breaks into an unconventional and tangential narrative about love, hustlers, desire, drugs, conspiracy, film scripts, and the actress ZoÃ« Lund. Head and Hands is a fascinating look at the obsessive forces at play and self-destructive tendencies that often accompany creative brilliance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head and Hands: My Black Angel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
