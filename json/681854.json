A Siberian shaman scales the Tree of Life and attains enlightenment. The Contrary Clowns descend to an underworld of improbably hilarity. A Chinese oracle foresees the collapse of an unbalanced civilization. A Zen frog smiles. Zen clowns act out absurdity in the maze. Cybele, the Anatolian goddess of wildlife, sees a wasteland of loneliness and oppression. In the distance, a familiar song is heard. Winter ends with the coming of spring. Her longed-for partner returns. Accompanied by drums, cymbals and pipes, the worlds of Chief Seattle, Lzo-Tze and Kabir illuminate the way. Love and boundless creativity are celebrated by seers, clowns, and all their friends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2nxsSU1hnp90cL4SFfrVhKYwxrA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seers and Clowns","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
