In this film, the stories of 35 kids from the Point, gathered at scripting workshops, are woven into a narrative structure by screenwriters, and the kids play themselves in front of the camera. The result is a remarkable drama about one fated weekend when the teenagers' lives unexpectedly intersect to solve a mystery that has haunted their neighbourhood for years. A truly collaborative process from page to screen, The Point gives sound and vision to these teenagers born on the wrong side of the tracks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Point","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
