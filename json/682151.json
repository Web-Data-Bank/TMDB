Pollet).  \"Mas-Félipe Delavouët wrote five books in Provençal, 14,000 verses. A sort of \"Odyssey\". Of myths. What is stunning in him is that he always talks of disappearances. Cities, works, men, writings, television, etc., everything has to disappear. In order to be reborn. No pain. A sort of hand-to-hand of man and nature. During the filming, I would simply throw out some words... For example, one time I said \"creation\" and he said: \"creation doesn't exist..., creation is before me..., I can only read creation\"; this sentence describes Delavouët perfectly (J.-D. Pollet, 1989 and 1993).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gHT9VJu4MVljw1LAvXPqbw7bZNa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Arbre et le Soleil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
