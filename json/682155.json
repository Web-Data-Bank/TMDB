They offer their account of mystifying experiences in connection with the afterlife, of evil deeds by people who passed away long ago in need of atonement. The film investigates the hidden signs of mountain magic and reminds us of our own myths, ghosts and primal images. It also looks for paths to self-awareness that could be revealed to us within and under layers of centuries-old Catholic cultural sediment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2cxZ6QKv2hRdm2ghYn0DSEUS0lH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130346,"logo_path":null,"name":"Calypso Film AG","origin_country":""},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2011-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Revenants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
