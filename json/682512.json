The film reveals various processes in the water that are hidden to the naked human eye. By investigating the brackish water, its inhabitants, its properties, and the traces left by human activities, the film is a reflection upon the relationship we humans have with our surroundings, especially through what we cannot see.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kssuvDKgEsgC5F865xJyd1GQ9yp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reclaiming Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
