Just six years later, Andrew Latimer was the only surviving member. The music industry has written off Camel as a \"dinosaur.\"\r 43 years later, Camel returned to Albert for another sold-out show. This is a very personal performance and showcases the current lineup, which is applauded by many as the best in the band's long history.\r The concert was filmed on Monday 17 September 2018. The band performed Moonmadness in full plus other classic tracks.  Line-up: Andrew Latimer - Guitar, Flute, Vocals / Colin Bass - Bass, Bass Pedals, Vocals / Denis Clement - Drums, Electronic Percussion / Pete Jones - Keyboards, Saxophone, Vocals","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xUUji9rXSp3tRlFsFjdcGcsmyy8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camel: Live at the Royal Albert Hall","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
