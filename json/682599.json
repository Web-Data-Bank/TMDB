A psychedelic experimenter, cyberspace pioneer, and environmentalist, he is now urging humanity to use our god-like powers to reframe our relationship with time and life itself. Today, Stewart is using biotech to resurrect extinct species. He and a team of scientists travel to Siberia to collect ancient DNA in an effort to make a hybrid Woolly Mammoth. Former allies in the environmental movement vow to stand in his way, but Stewart forges ahead in his life-long mission to conserve the whole earth.","popularity":1.786,"poster_path":"/woVDl5jwWshiiDzKEchYmbNF1tg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140625,"logo_path":"/5bfT1xXojwMO6puPG1N0L9pSL5P.png","name":"Stripe Press","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about Stewart Brand.","title":"We Are As Gods","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
