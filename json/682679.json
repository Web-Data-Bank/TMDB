Shot on location in Jaguariúna, São Paulo, Los Angeles and Long Beach, the film contains never-before-seen archival footage, and interviews with Tiago's family, who explain how they initially forbade skateboarding. While Tiago’s friends explain their reactions to seeing him skate for the first time, Tiago just dreams of going pro, a dream that is realized--by surprise--on his 25th birthday.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m5aBS4Ca2tiiHsvSGrHqwL8VcQ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guerreiro: The Tiago Lemos Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
