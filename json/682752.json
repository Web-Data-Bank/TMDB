Yes, the strength of what is eternally equal, a burden on our very lives. An empty discourse in favour of an order that grants nothing, but conformity. A thinking and acting dedicated to arrogance, to the sublimation of what he does not want to change, because he is too stable. The same inertia that, every day, takes a life; and returns a death. No, here there is no passion, no crime, there is nothing, but a method to try not to perceive subtle changes... There are no more poets or philosophers, nor even people; this whole vast world is made up of masked faces, in silence, before the very drama that, in their dreams, they would like to realize.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3KT7u3zhQ9oOp8HDLgRO4d9XXIn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2013-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The unbearable mundanity of being","title":"The unbearable mundanity of being","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
