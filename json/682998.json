The performance was recorded by an army of cameramen for a DirectTV special. The intense creative vision of BÖC’s original core duo of vocalist and lead guitarist Donald “Buck Dharma” Roeser, and vocalist and rhythm guitarist Eric Bloom are complemented by Richie Castellano on guitar and keyboards, and the longtime rhythm section comprised of bass guitarist Kasim Sulton, and drummer Jules Radino. As a special guest, founding member Albert Bouchard appears on guitar and vocals on selected tracks, which was a real treat for longtime fans of the band.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/2MXnRi0dqQSY2cIZGICCuwdqJyS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Öyster Cult ‎- 40th Anniversary - Agents Of Fortune - Live 2016","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
