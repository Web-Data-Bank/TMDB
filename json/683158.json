Chiara Stella, Domenico and Alessio are all 15 years old and every Monday they go to theatre classes at the Centro Asterix, a recreational space with a small theatre, located in San Giovanni in Teduccio, a district in the eastern suburbs of Naples.  The film closely follows the relationships between the children and their teachers; Nicola encourages the children to look into themselves and find ways of facing life with a conscious and above all calm approach. The stories, the needs and personalities of Chiara Stella, Domenico and Alessio emerge through crises, successes and reflection; they open up to each other thanks to the methods and direction of Nicola and through improvisation on the stage. The theatre thus becomes a space for discussion and self-analysis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hwhLqTTfkFdUkVb1wF9OuVyBqDk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88415,"logo_path":"/eILTlrcolO64UUvODgfKtvgNLcH.png","name":"Parallelo 41","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“It can’t always be summer\" is a documentary that examines the development of a group of teenage kids from the outskirts of Naples and their involvement in a theatre group.","title":"It can't always be summer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
