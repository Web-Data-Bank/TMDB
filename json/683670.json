There is nothing for them to be happy about. The resulting crisis is obvious to all, so the friends agree on the following game: every Wednesday, one player gives the other a task which is to be carried out by any means. The task can be rather strange, absurd, cruel or impracticable. The next week, the two players trade places. The only restriction is that the task should not be life-threatening or result in commiting a crime. The outer world as well as the friends' inner lives change as the weeks go by. Instead of looking for high-level, magnificent entertainment, the friends develop a taste for fantastic attractions – and ulti­mately rediscover joy in life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5E8KVJy5WUaY0lPAKkm1ECuJsHz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panoptikum Film Company","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2006-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happypeople","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
