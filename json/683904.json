Eventually she finds out this plan, so she asks for a divorce and leaves her son, who later is discovered to have kidney failure. She leaves for the U.S. where she meets Nick, a student who wants to escape from his conservative, and troubled family. Nick really loves Arini, but the latter is still involved in many matters related to her ex-husband. The director, Sophan Sophiaan, who has a political activist family background, always uses his films to criticise social and political issues. Only this time, he does it in a more subtle way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kVuil1HgJCWThZ4hzfWY8jZsSV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130686,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Sanggar Film","origin_country":""},{"id":104173,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Elang Perkasa Film","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arini (There are Still Trains Passing By)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
