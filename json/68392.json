The discovery of gas off this remote coastal village has led to the most dramatic clash of cultures in modern Ireland. The rights of farmers over their fields, and of fishermen to their fishing grounds, has come in direct conflict with one of the world's most powerful oil companies. When the citizens look to their State to protect their rights, they find that the government has put Shell's right to lay a pipeline over their own.","popularity":0.739,"poster_path":"/uteMTrfDuASEAQcC3T91JtydCXs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7323,"logo_path":null,"name":"ScannaÃÅin Inbhear Teo","origin_country":""},{"id":7324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Underground Films","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2011-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Big Oil.
