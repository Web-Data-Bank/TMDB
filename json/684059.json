The entire album was performed live, featuring original album singers and musicians, such as Thijs Van Leer, Fish, Damian Wilson, Edward Reekers, Anneke van Giersbergen, and several special guests including Simone Simons (Epica) and Star Trek's John De Lancie as narrator.  The 'Other Tales' are deep cuts from Arjen Lucassen's other projects, such as The Gentle Storm, Ambeon, Stream of Passion, Guilt Machine, Star One, his solo-album Arjen Anthony Lucassen and a very special Marillion cover.","popularity":1.256,"poster_path":"/apdCjuQXjt8PljQbbbddc15hQ5E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mascot Records","origin_country":""},{"id":130712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Music Theories Recordings","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ayreon: Electric Castle Live And Other Tales","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":3}
