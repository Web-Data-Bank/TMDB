The film intimately follows Lupita, a Tzotzil Maya woman, as she takes on the responsibility to be the spokeswoman of her people. Part lyrical testimony, part tribute to 500 years of indigenous resistance, this film mediates the point-of-view of a brave woman who must balance the demands of motherhood with her high stakes choices to reeducate and restore justice to the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9DA8c7vV3xK4je2X3djSw38ByDP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lupita","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":4}
