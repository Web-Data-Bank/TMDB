We hide like dust under the carpet all that we destroy and abuse, cloaking our indifference and opportunism with an aura of holiness and beauty. We do not recognize death, abuse, violence, and banality, but we are obsessed with form. From the environment to human rights, from technology to art, no area is excluded. Everything is functional to egocentricity and idolatry, even in the face of the prospect of self-destruction. Without perspectives and without solutions, we are part of a holy excrement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g4m1A7Gm6Bosa2PVzhBXntljeID.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holy Krap!","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
