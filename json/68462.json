As young martial artists Mike Chaturantabut and Matt Mullins fight their way through the world's most prestigious tournament, East meets West in a stunning application of visual technologies and the biomechanical secrets behind the world's martial arts are revealed for the first time. Using a unique graphic technique that allows for \"in-the-body\" animation of joints and muscles, experts demonstrate the basic principles behind muscular torque and leverage - creating fighting and sparring scenes unlike anything you've ever seen. Weapon masters showcase the physics behind the fiercest weapon styles - the twin broadswords, the Chinese straight sword and the Katana - and demonstrate how warriors can quickly master even common household items - like a traditional Japanese hand fan - to devastate their opponents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/82wwovP48IFWTJlFsF36vhxLxPe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6790,"logo_path":"/A0TzRpnwLcUcNgrvDJ0BIajf56b.png","name":"Discovery Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XMA: Xtreme Martial Arts","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
