We get interviews with the visual effects supervisors, the stunt coordinators and even are taken through aspects of pre-production and planning for the scene. Then the documentary moves into production, the scariest aspect of which is certainly Carrie Anne-Moss trying to learn to ride a motorcycle good enough to do so safely without helmet for the scene. We also watch as the stretch of freeway used in the film is being built.","popularity":1.624,"poster_path":"/zkpzfTyF7BjadH1PZKlC6kueWXf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Matrix Reloaded: Car Chase","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
