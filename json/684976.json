In this FOCUS production, Fr. Mark Beard helps to explain the Doctrine of Purgatory that he refers to as Heaven’s Hospital.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4O7F0Tr1SlBJ7tPuT0S3mHmHjhR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven's Hospital","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
