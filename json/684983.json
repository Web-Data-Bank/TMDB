Thank you very much for participating in the Famicom event \"Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School.\" And congratulations on winning a prize! I send you an autographed videotape. Please be careful with it. I will remember the drama (game) we starred together in forever as a precious memory, and I’m going to do my best in songs and dramas in the future. I’ll be happy if you also remembered this as a precious memory. And please watch over me from now on forever. Well then, I’m looking forward to the day we’ll meet again. For those who beat Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School and registered their \"Best Ending\" victory via the Disk Fax network, this tape was given out as a special prize to 8000 winners. This tape showcases behind the scenes footage of Nakayama Miho and her involvement in the game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xS3vrM7VRdw5Pqb5u6DUM6WMWny.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12288,"logo_path":"/e4dQAqZD374H5EuM0W1ljEBWTKy.png","name":"Nintendo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3341,"logo_path":"/dTG5dXE1kU2mpmL9BNnraffckLU.png","name":"Fuji Television Network","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":10038,"logo_path":"/nCueXKwYIEXrZ5ofqSJBO1YcmRr.png","name":"SQUARE ENIX","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":11328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burning Production","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1988-02-29","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idol Hotline: Miho Nakayama's Tokimeki High School","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
