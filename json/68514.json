Idea: Pluto paces off a distance, buried treasure style, and digs a large bone-shaped hole. Butch falls for it, and while he's digging deeper, Pluto almost makes off with the bone. Butch catches on just in time and chases Pluto, who ducks into a junkyard. The bone gets sucked into in a squeeze-bulb horn, which Pluto does battle with.","popularity":0.85,"poster_path":"/lWiNLf0ueNWNX0rUETxmQTvZ04C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"T-Bone for Two","video":false,"vote_average":5.844,"vote_count":16}
