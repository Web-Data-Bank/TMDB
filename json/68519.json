The coyote fakes a bad leg; Pluto chases it away, only to have it run back ahead of him and go after the sheep. Pluto gets back and finds the coyote chasing the lone black sheep of the flock, after trapping the rest. The chase ends with the coyote buried under a toppling spire of rock, which forms a coyote of rock on the top.","popularity":1.544,"poster_path":"/v8hXvrmWV8Ub7lvYYOQZqXJRcmV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legend of Coyote Rock","video":false,"vote_average":6.438,"vote_count":16}
