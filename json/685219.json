Catalyst examines multiple separate, yet coexisting memories drawn from footage I acquired at various times and different places in North America.

A story that takes place in time and space, shaped by the earth and sky.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dgfmUqmT1QRqyncbVFTlljg7MSF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catalyst","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
