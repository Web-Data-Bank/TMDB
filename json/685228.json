In modern times, this single line has earned Saint Paul the hatred of radical feminists everywhere, as well as the embarrassment of many Christians who do not understand what he meant. Because of this teaching, Paul has been called a misogynist, a male-chauvinist, and worse.  In one of his most challenging and inspiring presentations, Dr. Pitre tackles this controversial Scripture head-on and shows how Ephesians 5 is not a justification for male chauvinism, but a life-changing vision of the Christian family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lmwOtpeadNgetXQexWigXZeODZ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wives Do What?!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
