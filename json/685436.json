In a diary, Saint Faustina recorded all that God told her and during the last four years of her life she wrote the equivalent of 600 printed pages. This was a work of faith.  Divine Mercy - No Escape captures the tenderness of Sister Faustina's heart toward her mission as she receives the call. But there is more to this film than the moving story of a young nun whose compassion reaches beyond her to touch all generations. It is the story of Divine Mercy unfolding today.  Filmed in Poland, the Vatican, Germany, and the United States and narrated by Broadway and screen legend Helen Hayes, the screenplay was written and developed by Father Seraphim Michalenko, MIC, and Hermann D. Tauchert.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xgwgEwRvp06KF0ISJCbmjQiypWk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Life of Saint Maria Faustina","title":"Divine Mercy No Escape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
