The first part covers the traumas of his formative years: his ill-fated love affair with his first cousin, the death of his father, and his decorated service with the French Resistance. He had settled in France before the Second World War, met fellow Irishman James Joyce, and begun writing. Patrick Magee's television performance of `Krapp's Last Tape' (1972) is interwoven with key landscapes and personalities from Beckett's life. The second part concludes the story of how Beckett finally began to connect with his audience, principally through `Waiting for Godot'. Includes an interview with the actress Billie Whitelaw, a celebrated interpreter of his work.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/9PpDx2KUGTjNuC6HSqCLM5GIggT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Araby Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samuel Beckett As the Story Was Told","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
