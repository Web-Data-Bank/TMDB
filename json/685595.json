He tries to convince his partner, Jim Tyler, than it's cheaper to be married than to continually \"play the field\". The main reason he's doing that is because Jim is obsessed with the beautiful Evelyn, a gold-digger on whom Jim is spending prodigious amounts of money.

Something has to be done.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v5PEM6cd0QZxkmUdMBH19wyOnAM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheaper to Marry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
