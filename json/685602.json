In a nutshell: es is zum Scheissn!\r The Kronen Zeitung speaks the mind of the philistine bourgeoisie and tells about \"drug abuse, duck murders and sex orgies\", the city government reluctantly provides a youth center only to evict it subsequently, a former Nazi becomes president and Vienna is burning because of the Opera Ball demonstrations.\r Punk in Vienna was not different than punk anywhere else. And yet, it was. \"Scheiss Kieberei\" instead of ACAB, Dead Nittels instead of California über alles, \"Nazis raus\" by Extrem on the same compilation as \"We're gonna fight\" by 7 Seconds. And anyway, the band names: Chuzpe, Schund, Pöbel. The outcast kids of Helmut Qualtinger tell their own story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ddifPN00lqmBaDG9dTLz91wNPmv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2020-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Vienna, you dead city\" was more than just a slogan on a leather jacket.","title":"Es is zum scheissn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
