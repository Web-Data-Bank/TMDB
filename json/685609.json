A bottle of Jack makes a statement (and this documentary is all about “why”).  More than a simple narrative of the origins and impact of this hallowed brand, Chasing Whiskey is a 57,000 mile journey across 5 countries and 17 time zones that will prove equal parts thought provoking, insightful, moving and hilarious.  From rural Lynchburg, TN (where every drop of Jack is made) to the Outback of Australia, from Beverly Hills to the streets of Havana, Cuba; from the stills in the Hollow to the stills of Scotland’s finest Scotch, from studio jams to backstage tours, this journey documents a cultural exploration into why a world of people identifies with a distinctly American brand.","popularity":1.624,"poster_path":"/jUUDp0AjbWuJFFLdLs9rcr4oNmp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132193,"logo_path":"/aOmd6bt5kmkFtWLRGfEHvKixOjG.png","name":"Evolve Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing Whiskey","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
