With Bohemian Rhapsody halfway through its nine-week run atop the charts in December 1975, Queen chose Christmas Eve to play a televised tour de force from London's Hammersmith Odeon. Freddie Mercury had a deep-rooted love for everything Christmas, with a lifelong generosity of spirit. In this documentary, friends and loved ones reflect on the band, alongside many of Queen's best-loved hits and rare footage of Mercury with some of his closest confidantes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yuC4j3UhAHsdVBbcLJV141BL0NO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18753,"logo_path":"/asraHRJpb33SStIEX6SWNjtXYGl.png","name":"North One Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Freddie Mercury had a love for Christmas","title":"Freddie Mercury: A Christmas Story","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
