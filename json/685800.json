This documentary follows their evolution from the San Francisco Suicide Club - 1977, the exploits of SF Cacophony, their nexus creating the Burning Man Festival, to the irreverent Los Angeles Cacophony and beyond. This is the history of the most significant American underground cultural movement of our time! 'The Cacophony Society is, 'a randomly gathered network of free spirits engaged in the pursuit of experiences beyond the mainstream.' The credo is 'You May Already be a Member!' It's a non-religious, non-political, non-commercial disorganization of Dada klowns rewiring the neuro-circuits of humanity. The heart of Cacophony is deeply routed in kitsch, weird and nihilism.. It's subversion by way of absurdist pranks and fire!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qxzhUuxisa4baaddcPdWaLbgMgN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreamland","origin_country":""},{"id":131011,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weird TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into the Zone: The Story of the Cacophony Society","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
