Freud's account of his sessions with Dora was the only major case history he published of a female patient. Intercutting his published text with a scripted version told from Dora's point of view, Hysterical Girl revisits this landmark case. Woven throughout are several decades of cinema, Congressional hearings, and media coverage. What emerges is a portrait of the grip that Freudâ€™s theory of hysteria has had on popular culture over the past century and into the present day.","popularity":0.97,"poster_path":"/3S4G8q055zia0g0FeZoz8PjzaYy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossvack Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hysterical Girl","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
