I reworked this footage via JK Optical Printer using a larger than normal film gate designed (by myself) to allow the re-filming and hence layering of frame clusters as well as single frames.  This project explores an intersection between transition and memory (passing time, times past, arrested in time, what lies ahead) through looping, stretching, and layering of images filmed originally while driving through this unique preserve of Romanian culture. A silent, visual sketchbook of sorts, this work explores the repetitive, cyclical structuring of this Super 8 footage developed over several years of working with a JK Printer. The result is an open and meditative work around the subject of “passage.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kWOh9jrP5x9kJ4pecqzuR7FnOdM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rushlight (Here Today Gone Tomorrow)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
