Over a decade later they would adopt him as their son, and he would move to British Columbia in order to live near them. Though he is white and European, Jean-Luc's affinity with the spiritual values of North American Native cultures drew him into a relationship with the Selam family. French Man, Native Son recounts the unique exchange between Jean-Luc, now 28, and his adoptive parents. He will always retain his original heritage, even while actively participating in the life, responsibilities, and traditions of the family who have welcomed him into their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lInAknk09YWU2O0tYx7EPjnjzNM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"French Man, Native Son","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
