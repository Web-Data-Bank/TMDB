She not only recorded the everyday life of her immediate surroundings, but also life in the bomb-destroyed city of Dortmund and the later reconstruction after 1945 with the camera and thus captured it for posterity. But there are also industrial, commercial and travel films as well as reports in her work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/UEgBLUlBk4g1CNv0v1Wt13J8UA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131058,"logo_path":null,"name":"LWL MedienZentrum Westphalen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erich, lass mal laufen!: Die Filme der Elisabeth Wilms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
