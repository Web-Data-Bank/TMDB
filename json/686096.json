During the dictatorship, this building was the most progressive Catholic seminary in Portugal. António, the front door neighbor, was brought up and raised a family in its shadow. Ever since the Dominican priests left, he has been its most faithful caretaker - keeper of ghosts, memories, and hallways now emptied of life. Abandoned for years, the town's former epicenter now hopes for a new life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9110KoDyI8sC6xC7vSYoPvWZMCV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
