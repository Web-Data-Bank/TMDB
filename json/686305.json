Jun-young and Sung-jun may have something unusual, but they are bored with their daily routines. Then one day, Sung-jun learned about an invitation-only blind party from a junior in the company. Is there any reason for any man not to go?  The place was full of excitement. Jun-yeong opened the door and while the place looked so much different, he could still recognize it instantly.  One day without any word, a woman, Na-young, disappeared like a smoke. Because of a rule that he cannot ask anything, he ended up having sex with Na-young, and just like that, she disappears. Jun-yeong couldn’t tell if he’s dreaming or not. When he met Sung-jun and talked about what happened, Sung-joon will give him the contact details of the blind party organizer. After much thought, he finally contacted the host to see Na-young again. Na-young waits for Jun-yeong in the hotel room. How will the night be for Na-young and Jun-yeong?","popularity":2.391,"poster_path":"/3nL1uAjVRgzBzrJCPYi9xIkaa7r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Partner","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
