Though they were only married for a short period of time, Sophia’s husband decided to leave her the family arms-dealing business, much to the chagrin of his three sons, all of whom expected to be given some kind of “promotion” upon his death. Sophia is conflicted about being in this position of power; she didn’t want it, she didn’t work for it, but it’s hers. Instead of passing the role down to someone else, Sophia decides it’s worth seeing how much she can get away with now that she’s calling the shots, if only for the fun of it.","popularity":1.036,"poster_path":"/3sde0BOEufQvkbc9Hnh7AaFNtdy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6112,"logo_path":"/qyaL5C9wEIUYJOoF84mttDjLbH2.png","name":"Digital Playground","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matriarch","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
