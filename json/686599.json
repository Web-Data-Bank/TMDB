They were forcibly placed in a closed institution to be studied, measured and weighed – exactly in the way that nature itself was starting to be examined around the same time. Today, the place is a research centre. A young female scientist collects samples on the island, while the whispering voices of the past and never-sent letters echo in the empty hallways.","popularity":0.959,"poster_path":"/3A6fU3lDfEWbxHbO02jnlfTUZBU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16214,"logo_path":"/uPBm0dQNLBQ6CLbigDonXqKkA9Z.png","name":"Made","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":2396,"logo_path":"/v0U7OZwjgv2vmiHbS2HNqjX9MEc.png","name":"Finnish Film Foundation","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2020-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Själö - Island of Souls","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
