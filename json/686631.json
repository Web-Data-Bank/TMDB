But the dream is almost impossible to realise, as Rekha's family is planning to marry her off to a young boy in the neighbouring village. 'The Beloved Daughter' is a colourful but delicate tale about how poverty and cultural traditions force Rekha's father to send her away from the family and make her step into adulthood at a far too early age. For even though child marriage is prohibited by law – even in Nepal – the tradition is still widespread and responsible for determining the fate of children like Rekha all over the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bSVtWu2SdPWe3MOzFR6d5yHFm3w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Icebreaker Productions [Finland]","origin_country":""},{"id":2396,"logo_path":"/v0U7OZwjgv2vmiHbS2HNqjX9MEc.png","name":"Finnish Film Foundation","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2020-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beloved Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
