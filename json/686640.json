On October 16, 2018, an unprecedented operation targeted Jean-Luc Mélenchon and his family: 15 searches were carried out simultaneously by a hundred prosecutors and police directly under the orders of the Ministry of Justice. Unheard of in France. The prosecutor who orchestrated this operation, François Molins, close to President Emmanuel Macron, was rewarded less than a month later by being appointed to the highest office of the judiciary. This film carefully documents the facts that make this case an emblematic case of lawfare.","popularity":0.634,"poster_path":"/AcREKeub2DuK8JyJpbpu1MUe0yJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lawfare : le cas Mélenchon","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
