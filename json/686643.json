A war that – like so many others – is waged for political reasons, which rarely have anything to do with reality. As a result, thousands of Muslims are imprisoned on false charges of conspiring to commit terrorist crimes. One of them is the human rights activist Dilya's brother Iskandar, who has been imprisoned in the notorious Jaslyk prison in a barren desert since 2002 – an inhumane place of which there are no images. Today, she lives in exile in Sweden because of the threats and harassment, but Dilya continues to fight the case of her brother and other prisoners with the help of Amnesty International.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/3j1SF9EsfT0oYn0DjwfEgsbcKYi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17518,"logo_path":"/1gPGo3B6BAFYSRQ3X6NumB3nGMU.png","name":"Auto Images","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Uzbek","iso_639_1":"uz","name":"ozbek"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only the Devil Lives Without Hope","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
