And it would be all right for the naughty homies if the Deliquentes Clan could keep their hands off the big deal. The police, who are known not to shy away from losses, are getting closer and closer to resolving the case through the clever investigation by special agent Joe Miller ... But in this world, where violence is preferred over prudence, the barometer stands for death - and that's exactly what we're going to see.  Bullenblut 2 is supposed to reveal how things really go on Winterthur's streets, nothing more and nothing less.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jlZMQ9U85EpdqO0DlFolbAP4xVd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Naegelsee Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2001-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bullenblut 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
