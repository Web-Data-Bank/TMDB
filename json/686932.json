A group of people dressed in white robes perform a choreographed ritual, led by an androgynous figure dressed in black, who leads them through an American metropolis and on to a cemetery where they bury their weapons in a pacifist gesture, but do so with power, pride and a will to resist. As they part with their machines, the members of the enigmatic group create a monument to life and the living, at the same time as they establish a connection to the phantoms of the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Undertaker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
