From the very first day of school and over the course of an entire school year, we follow four young students at AFUK's artiste programme. Four youths, who each in their own way don't feel that they fit into a regular academic high school. We join Mads, Oliver, Zanya and Andy from the first nervous moments to when they stand proud and brave with newly found physical and mental strength in front of a large audience for the school's closing performance Festivitas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2F0B3Ds8ZtbzmENEI4FH1uve4pD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16439,"logo_path":"/saXOIbS0x4LxBUHQZvuKuoV4tAk.png","name":"Made in Copenhagen","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dare To Do Whatever","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
