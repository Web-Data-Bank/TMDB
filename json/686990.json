Signe remembers only very little from that time in the late 1980s, and her father doesn't like to talk about it. In order to fill in the many gaps, she contacts the several nannies who helped out in their household the following years. It turns out that they all remember things in their own way. 'The Nannies' is a performative documentary with plenty of creative energy driving a deeply personal project. The stories of the past are conjured up through tasteful reconstructions of life in the suburbs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6H2v7Um87znVwqxc4RT603NmXkn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nannies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
