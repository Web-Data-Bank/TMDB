A post-apocalyptic science fiction scenario, which the London-based artist Sofia Albina Novikoff Unger makes manifest out of both existing places and digital interventions, and which invites the imagination of the viewer to wander with Niva in search of a disappeared friend. On the soundtrack, a voice from the future speaks of lost civilisations that uncannily resemble our own, and about man-made technologies that have turned against their makers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Slow Longing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
