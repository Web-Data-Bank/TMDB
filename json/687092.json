Ernesto Arturo Miranda (1941 - 1976) was a laborer whose conviction on kidnapping, rape, and armed robbery charges based on his confession under police interrogation was set aside in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona, which ruled that criminal suspects must be informed of their right against self-incrimination and their right to consult with an attorney before being questioned by police. This warning is known as a Miranda warning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cxLlOySGLDFHlkCGSk937dIoMSH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Miranda Case","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
