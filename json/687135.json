Objects and devices become bodily and manipulative. The magician is a composed cartoon machine repeating tricks and equations. When products become prosthetics does the accessory take some emotional control? A creative trance. A collaborative force.

A filmic exhibit and retail site that morphed into an experimental piece of moving image occupying the dual space between utility and art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bu829gVYFFqUuTuUT0CigLZYsvZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plasma Vista","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
