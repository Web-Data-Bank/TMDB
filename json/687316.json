Each with a vastly different story, they are all linked by their displacement and the sole choice of call center work they have in a country that is so unfamiliar and oftentimes frightening, yet other times a ray of hope. Tijuana becomes their home, a place defined by the border but yet defiant towards it, a no man's land where everything and everyone feels transient. These characters paint a picture of love, loss and longing - for home, for an American Dream deferred, and for justice.","popularity":0.636,"poster_path":"/ru4vtlJ7H3NcLTsyEOlClN2K7Ju.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Center Blues","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
