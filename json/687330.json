Over the course of a year, Wilson set out to document— and accentuate—his surroundings through camera filters, angles, repetition, and audio. The end result is a hypnotic journey through the hidden wonders and beauties of the Northwest forests, in vivid colors and immaculate black-and-whites.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fZdux84GwtsI6X2nIhWCiCbhTs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home in the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
