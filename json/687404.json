Her name is Marie and she is a convicted murderer, out on early release from prison, and driven by a single purpose–revenge. Living under a secret identity as Bethany, Marie has connived her way to living and working close to Lisa, lurking and planning her revenge as payment for the life she feels cheated out of–a life she feels their father unfairly gave to Lisa. Marie has set a deadly trap for Lisa to take back what she is owed, leaving Lisa, her mother and their friends to fight for their lives against the murderous sister she never knew.","popularity":2.852,"poster_path":"/uojfc1kwW3uB3UBN2dZhmGGdiOz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92019,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative Arts Entertainment Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's no escaping family secrets","title":"Revenge for Daddy","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":7}
