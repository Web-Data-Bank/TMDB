Maar’s extraordinary life saw her working alongside the greatest names in the Parisian art scene; she was also the lover of Picasso and the wife of Georges Bataille. Toppling conventions and shattering norms, Dora Maar breathed strength and character back into the image of 20th-century women. Hailed by critics, this film is an intimate portrayal that handles its subject with skill and sensitivity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3jeHYWnvZjdSwpBpmdjH48SrJjI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dora Maar, Between Light and Shade","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
