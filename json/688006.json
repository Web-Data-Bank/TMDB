Well known for mixing disco, pop, rap and reggae into their sound - it was a formula that earned them massive success, going on to sell more than 40 million albums around the world. They were the first act to have UK Number 1 singles in the 70s, 80s and 90s - with six chart topping tracks. Inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, they are the next act to take to the Hyde Park stage, introduced by Jo Whiley and Tony Blackburn.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oU85nhHrpNjQIjQUAdSMIlWtYvr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blondie: BBC Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
