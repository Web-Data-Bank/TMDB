Among the characters, some met their partners in the penitentiary; others had been visiting their husbands for decades. They feel valued by them and say they are well loved. They are women who insist on a relationship full of constraints and privations, even suffering various consequences of this option on a daily basis. In this film the prison universe is almost exclusively present in the report of the women, and never from the point of view of the husbands.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/laARKUyjqffFwzEAZywfv0QQQ0k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Visit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
