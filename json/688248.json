It stands as a lonely, silent witness to the horrible tragedy that befell Graun (Curon) and Reschen (Resia) in 1950, when both villages — with their unique natural and cultural landscape — were submerged by the waters of the newly-built Resia dam and water reservoir. This documentary film project aims to give a voice to the tragedy’s last contemporary witnesses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ruy2M3IkNybVfHiLUoQs4jBx7kl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sunken Village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
