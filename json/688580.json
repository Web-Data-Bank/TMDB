It's an anarchist vision of the chaos we need for this change to occur (because anarchism is not mess, it's mutual support and solidarity). Of course, in 4 minutes there's no way to theorize about something so complex, but given the inequalities of today we have to do something, even if it's a short 4-minute short that, perhaps, awakens the inner revolutionary of those who watch (or not ).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lPDWe6wKgQwkukNamdqubYduU9r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28333,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canibal Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ándale!","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
