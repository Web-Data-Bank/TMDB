The movie features unprecedented access to Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey’s offstage life on the road, showing them traveling from gig to gig, meeting fans before the shows, and warming up prior to hitting the stage.  Among The Who classics included in the documentary are ‘I Can’t Explain’, ‘Who Are You’, ‘Cry If You Want’, ‘Relay’, ‘Eminence Front’, ‘Baba O’Riley’, and ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again’, alongside newer material including ‘Mike Post Theme’, ‘Black Widow’s Eyes’, and ‘Man In A Purple Dress’.
