The Great Ghosts is a cinematographic adaptation of this special project in a breathtaking setting. Balance and movement are the starting points for the choreography, with the famous Foucault Pendulum as the constant center. Bourgeois uses trampolines, a turntable and his famous “seesaw of frivolity”, with which he defies gravity and balances between beauty and fear. How far do the dancers dare to go while playing with Foucault’s Pendulum? And for how long?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l7epHGrHU0PYaAOJFYegbfXETrH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97975,"logo_path":null,"name":"GAD","origin_country":""},{"id":113099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Jack Fébus","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Great Ghosts is a cinematographic adaptation of “The Mechanics of History – an attempt to approach a point of suspension”, a dizzying performance, in a breathtaking setting.","title":"The Great Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
