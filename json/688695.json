John Cannizzaro is a maker of experimental films and stop-motion animations – working primarily in Super8mm and 16mm film. Exploring such diverse themes as childhood, memory, dreams, religion, and film making, his films blur the boundaries between narrative, documentary, animation, and poetry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tCbmhFGqvbvmXZcD6K0fpFufgTQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beatrice of 9","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
