A set of abandoned objects related to the attraction's fairs make me think of a schoolmate who wanted to be a ballet dancer. Bumper Cars and a rabbit I found in the forest sparked memories of the visits I made to the Fairs. Then I became a memories collector in contact with these objects. David, Empar, Manuel and Zé join me in this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gEHiVmX1ipijmJqR8vz9Gqj7HDn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Haunted House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
