Through its use of found footage, as well as archival television and radio broadcasts, the “SIN BIN” film series is an embellishment toward the sport's structured intersections of violence, culture, memory, and youth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mmibT26YMyXBzZgbViHlz8OW3rw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SIN BIN | FIRST STUDY | THE GRIM REAPER","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
