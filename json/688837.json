In a playful mix with the movement of light and the detail of the room, we travel around the whole house. With quiet movements we take a walk through the library's familiar and unfamiliar rooms from basement to loft. The film is a tribute to the library as a meeting place for everyone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7p1EI0dadWIiulL1SqDBu3ovtI8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrett av en bygning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
