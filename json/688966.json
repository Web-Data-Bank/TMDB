He challenges the meaning of hospital-jails, hybrid institutions which sentence the insane to life imprisonment. The poem \"The House of the Dead\" was written during the filming of the documentary and reveals the forgotten deaths that occur in these judicial asylums. There are three stories in three acts of death. Jaime, Antonio, and Almerindo are anonymous men, considered dangers to society, whose punishment is the tragedy of suicide, the unending cycle of being committed to the asylum, or surviving life imprisonment in the house of the dead. Bubu is the narrator of his own life and also of his own destiny-death in the asylum.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3A6wvi22oS0gQcPED7hLm7VjemX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101871,"logo_path":null,"name":"ImagensLivres","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2009-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House of the Dead","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
