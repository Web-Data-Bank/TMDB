Two women grapple in a slime-ridden dungeon. To the throb of a grungy, techno soundtrack the film builds to climax; the image disintegrates in a welter of scratches. This stunning and original film is an attempt to evoke modern myths of abduction and abuse by extra-terrestrials, lulling the audience into the trance-like state between sleep and consciousness. The startling images were filmed on black-and-white Super 8, hand-processed and luridly dyed. This is true alchemical erotica.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gvUitTkq7LQXuNiCN7eosvwsOE8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visitations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
