In the video version, as a tautological process, the content of the Pure Data application is read as pure data that are directly displayed as sounds and pixels. This is a concrete exploration of the binary code and its intrinsic qualities (structure, logic, rhythm, redundancy, compression) immediately returned by the computer in the form of visual and sound flows. A direct immersion in the heart of digital abstractions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cy6IBvF3XV6NxN6ylIUczA9rpX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pure Data Read as Pure Data","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
