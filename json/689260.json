He does not speak English well, he has issues even doing his simple job as a cleaner as he does not understand what the boss Mathew wants from him at certain times. He rather puts all his hopes into the future of his two children, his teenage son Dieudonne and his little daughter Aline as he wants them to study hard to embrace Australian culture, but never forget their African roots and make a successful life. Dieudonne does not care about his father's desire, he's a known troublemaker at school. He misleads his father by telling him that he is doing remarkably well in his studies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iM6QX2eBjXJsvfuIzEYtTfvNpN6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131583,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dollars Media Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Culture Shock","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
