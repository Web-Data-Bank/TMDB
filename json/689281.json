Millions of people were sent to Paris and to the French back-country, a one-way trip which, according to Aimé Césaire, was close to deportation. The living conditions in the mainland were far different from what had been promised beforehand.  Jackie Bastide gives a voice to those who have lived through the Bumidom and had to suffer from a migration that was meant to be the road to a better life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uZl78r7BkIA9myi9bNmH7o6qdMk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131590,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal Overseas Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":131591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ Overseas","origin_country":""},{"id":92191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Temps noir","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bumidom, des Français venus d'Outre-mer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
