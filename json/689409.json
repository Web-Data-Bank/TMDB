A fast-paced novel brings confusion into the hero's life and puts him in front of a choice: a new unexpected relationship or a proposed multi-month business trip to America, which causes envy among colleagues. Somehow, while completing the documents, Igor accidentally notices on the bulletin board a photo robot of a dangerous criminal who resembles Lera. Getting confused in comparisons, facts and doubts, he tries to find the truth.  The struggle between love and the realization of the bitter truth ends tragically.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yTZXghWypyrMM82zc11vYa2RCM9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3161,"logo_path":"/p22GDJaOniIWidl1vPqzBv4qxFN.png","name":"Odessa Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Is a Deadly Game","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
