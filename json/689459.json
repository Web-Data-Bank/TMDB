As some of the last of the still-living orphan train riders like to remind us, it was a different era - one that can't be judged without understanding what lives were like then. West by Orphan Train, a documentary film completed late in 2014, offers that understanding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gC9SrehU4rSqt33cYmOzXi2UIpu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West by Orphan Train","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
