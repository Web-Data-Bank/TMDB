Filmed on location in places like Hangberg, Smartietown, Cloetesville, Heuwelkroon, Boesmanskloof, Rondebosch Common and De Doorns, it features interviews with so-called activists and scenes of protest.  The footage was shot right at the beginning of the trouble, before the large-scale closing down of the N2, and provides a thrilling if spine-chilling picture of how the protest started as well as the political and cultural motivations behind it. A large segment of the film focuses on the struggle music of the growingly coherent group of people who have now started to call themselves \"Khoisan activists\", which is nothing less than a form of brown nationalism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Ander Rebellie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
