Fellini had always been a mysterious director, not only in his cryptic symbolism but also in his idiosyncratic, excessive mixture of psychoanalysis, Catholicism and faith in the mysterious. In this documentary, his relationship with the paranormal, luck and fate, alongside the coexistence of organized discourse and transcendence to the imaginary, is examined via friends, collaborators and distinguished fans (Friedkin, Gilliam, Chazelle). A great testimony to why rationalists and ideologists have a hard time with his work, ‘Fellini and the Spirits’ is an appropriate yet unexpected tribute.","popularity":2.455,"poster_path":"/gMzrbkvXLTZ4jmWqXwYvL3oHsO8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123682,"logo_path":"/2Nk24ubQNCkekarcDEDug0Pc9Z2.png","name":"Mad Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":8675,"logo_path":"/nhGrnKdP6GFXLk6fbLARjQNSMET.png","name":"Walking The Dog","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":111407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineteca del Comune di Bologna","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fellini of the Spirits","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":13}
