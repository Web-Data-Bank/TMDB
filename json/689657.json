The resulting film is an impro-vised free dance of shadows of female bodies. The nudes are captured in casual, graceful or discreetly suggestive poses. one senses a touch of ‘70s psychedelia and pop aesthetic. At the same time, they are reminsicent of a more austere context – the abstract studies of Matisse or the late esoteric nudes of Yves Klein.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yj5GhWX21jrlCVLzvNufSM4fsD8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
