The \"contestants\" are unaware they're even playing the game: the show's producers infiltrate houses, install surveillance cameras and broadcast footage for viewers to judge in such existential categories as doubt, alienation and disillusionment. A biting critique of the culture of surveillance as entertainment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gBfBdcuU3l8erMw1ig4EqrL6f1y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are you in it?","title":"Public Domain","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
