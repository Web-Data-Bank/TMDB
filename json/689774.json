By the time he died in 1991, he was known as 'Tai Ko Seng' which, roughly translated, means \"big brother who delivers\". Every year since his death, people gather on 30 July at the Island's Chinese cemetery, to pay tribute to Bennett as they would to their honoured ancestors. Big Brother of Christmas Island tells the moving story of how the legend of the \"Tai Ko Seng\" was born.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ncyztdTHVJ091AiDyuZRHb3vC4k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CX","name":"Christmas Island"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Brother of Christmas Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
