A roller coaster dramaturgy following the \"life\" of the four clones on screens.  Using a technique derived from the principals of the sound design technique called \"granular synthesis\" but applied to the rather fat grains of single video frames (visual content and sound), Granular-Synthesis manages to evoke from a few expressions on the face of the performer Akemi Takeya, a frenzied exploration of the alter ego within touching distance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hwAcWsauaP8dkTeD5D1utC9ccCE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Granular Synthesis: Modell 5","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
