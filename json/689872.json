All these roles were played by a man from Ticino who spoke Locarnese dialect: Hannes Schmidhauser. North of the Gotthard people still believe he was Swiss German. In Ticino he is merely remembered for his career as a football player. So it is high time that this personality commited to culture and sports be presented in more detail.","popularity":1.093,"poster_path":"/H6UBKo6VLVafG5xTaTbGFfLoAj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hannes 'Pussy' Schmidhauser","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
