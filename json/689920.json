From astronaut UFO encounters, to flashing lights, to geometric anomalies on the surface that appear to be structures, it's possible that the moon my actually be the home of ancient aliens or be serving as a base of operations. For the moon to be able to perfectly eclipse the sun is a mathematical impossibility based on our current understanding of psychics but we also know that the moon could be hollow from experiments performed on Apollo missions. Clearly, there is an intelligence involved with our mysterious satellite.","popularity":1.554,"poster_path":"/lDWHupnsyrWJDZVvEln8s6nJpsj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reality Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alien Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
