New encounters occur, as in scene 1 or 7, but mostly it's friends playing together and enjoying each other in all possible ways.

Beside the most welcome return of Brock and Chad to the fold, this is the film that revealed Genadij Prokov in all his glory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tAFjJsSyuStjGJ6yvBgjICb7Olp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126582,"logo_path":"/zIDtCugieAcKbL3LrxRrR6vWbXS.png","name":"Ayor Studios","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Splash!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
