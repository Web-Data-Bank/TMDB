However, the thousands of people of Itate, situated just outside the zone, and those who had fled the area and taken shelter there were left to their own devices for over a month. Later on Itate became a restricted area and the residents were allowed only visits having to leave the area for good.  The place became a ghost town, as it was too close to the Zone and many pets and farm animals are stranded there. There are said to be 150~200 dogs, 400~800 cats, 50 chickens and a pig although the exact numbers are unknown. The public interest in the accident has all but gone but there is one man who still cares what happens to those animals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/et88ElNjjXZ4ACGwVjylt6yUove.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131719,"logo_path":null,"name":"ADG-Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2015-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Contamination of the Title does not refer to the Nuclear Radiation","title":"Hidden Contamination","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
