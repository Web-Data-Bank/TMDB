Jack toys with Pierrot throughout the story, performing a satirical essence of white British sensibility whilst referencing early minstrel troupes’ caricatures of the post-slavery, black populace. Mixed-race Pierrot is encouraged to strive for her ‘white potential’ whilst battling rejection, rage, and the bending of time amidst the English countryside.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o0Re6pFCLODFwgFbOwxCozyvE4T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O' Pierrot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
