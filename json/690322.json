Set in a triangular post 9-11 site designed by Rufus Didwiszus, peculiar protagonists wake up realizing they survived a disaster and try to find a way out of this no exit place. They are surrounded by intangible, invisible angel-like dancing beings, who manipulate the gestures and actions of the colorful actors, sometimes tender, sometimes ill-intentioned. Each time they think they're safe, another catastrophe hits them, from an earthquake to a gas leak to being slaughtered by a hammer. Yet every time the chatty characters survive, as if something was still unfinished, their destiny unfulfilled. The drama is supported by the 14th century ars nova compositions interpreted live by the singers and musicians of Capilla Flamenca.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
