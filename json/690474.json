Recently, perhaps adversely influenced by information-addiction, many Bigfoot aficionados have dismissed “blobsquatches” (photos too blurry to be discernible as sasquatches) as an impediment to serious cryptozoological research. In this paranormal polemic, scientific jargon and genre tropes of investigative documentary are short-circuited and re-wired. The Blobsquatch is engaged critically to explore spaces between information and noise, obsolescence and adaptive re-use.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e7BNIQ4cfDQ4Nsdp2Lohyk5lKlC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blobsquatch: In the Expanded Field","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
