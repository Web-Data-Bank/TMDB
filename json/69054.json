In a radical dismissal of todays so called post-political era, he mobilizes the paradox of universal truth urging us to dare to enact the impossible. It is a characteristic virtuoso performance, moving promiscuously from subject to subject but keeping the larger argument in view.","popularity":1.115,"poster_path":"/96CIcAjCFPm5prasXoQSZyaqqAy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ben Wright Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A cinematic experience of Žižek's interpretations of reality and virtual reality.","title":"Slavoj Zizek: The Reality of the Virtual","video":false,"vote_average":6.538,"vote_count":13}
