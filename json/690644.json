Klaus vom Bruch's torso is inscribed with a rotating computer generated construction (in real: a handmade wooden model put on an ordinary turntable); creating a composite image that metaphorically describes a collapse of the private and public space of vitual media. This spectacle of technology imposed on the human body is accompanied by a haunting soundtrack of traditional songs of the Pygmies. Ultimately, the artist turns his butt onto the viewer, communicating with fundamental body language.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oGtoQIiXTaBlaLSEKy0AztvElms.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goblins' Chants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
