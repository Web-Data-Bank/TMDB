Cheesehead Blues Re-Cut is a music documentary on the state of the blues set in Clarksdale, Mississippi, birthplace of the delta blues and second home of Theo Dasbach, founder of the amazing Rock & Blues Museum. In 2011 filmmaker Jan Doense set out on a musical road trip in the Deep South of the U.S.A. While visiting Clarksdale – home of Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Ike Turner among others – he met fellow Dutchman Theo “Boogieman” Dasbach, a former international banker who had been sacked by his employer and then decided to move his enormous collection of blues and rock & roll memorabilia from Arum, Friesland to Clarksdale, Mississippi. This became the Rock & Blues Museum, one of the must-see attractions for any music lover visiting Clarksdale.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wnaoHryQtOk3BOYXaL7pld72GPO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheesehead Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
