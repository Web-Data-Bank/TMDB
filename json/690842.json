Struggling to make sense of their father’s early death, his teenage sons learn that during the 1970s when Asians in America were still considered “Orientals,” Chris’ music and passion for social justice helped provide the voice and identity an entire generation had been in search of. Through animated photographs, intimate home movies, archival footage of Chris’ introduction to nationwide television by John Lennon and Chris’ own songs, their father’s life takes on bigger meaning than they had ever dreamed of.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pG3OExxqwZ1UhNhyqv6kYV1BaoR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Song For Ourselves","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
