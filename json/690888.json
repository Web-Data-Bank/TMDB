Directed by Rafael Duarte (Bambalaio Filmes) and produced by Leonardo Edde (URCA Filmes), the documentary shows how Roman reached, during his preparation years, 4 of the “7 summits” during winter, considered by many an almost impossible mission. Survivor of the avalanche that hit the Khumbu Falls in 2014, a few feet from Everest Base Camp, Roman returned to the Himalayas four years later with Rafael Duarte and Padawa Shepa, who together documented the most challenging expedition of his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/886AZr7gvpG608SH4aQkrVvYKns.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65727,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bambalaio Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":37401,"logo_path":"/3l1TgK3IFBfSvYOqiO5gQ9rv0TU.png","name":"Urca Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"2019-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":3}
