Equal opportunity to better one's self, and the right to personally benefit from the gains realized, are consistent with freedom. Equality of results requires force. Taking from some to give to others destroys freedom and removes the incentive for creating new wealth. Friedman visits India, U.S. and Britain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qgTyLkeEG3M6yAUpBEWcJ7226IT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Created Equal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
