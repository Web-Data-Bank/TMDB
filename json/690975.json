An “on the road” journey across Europe. A character who is both ironic and tragically lost in the midst of everyday objects strewn throughout his days – shoes, cell phones, streets, stoplights – giving birth to an archipelago from a shipwreck, the refuge of a thought seeking to escape from itself.  He exists in a precarious balance between his thoughts which flow, oftentimes in a whisper, and the bombardment by external stimuli that bring him back to the reality from which he’s trying to escape, in an agitated soliloquy that is both comical and paradoxical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oH1WAlUXJoRPs1eLoVzLtco4Jxs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Time I Talk With Myself","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
