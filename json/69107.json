There are no surprises, either in song selection or in his band's impeccably smooth approach, but comfort is the point of the whole affair: it's one last chance for fans to hear those songs again. For anybody who isnâ€™t a fan -- or got off board somewhere around the time when Stars turned Simply Red into sensations everywhere but the U.S. -- this will hardly be cause for re-evaluation, but Farewell does celebrate everything that made Mick Hucknall into an international superstar.","popularity":0.977,"poster_path":"/tFoSITTQzbcSsmRnrLf3tiX0Fmm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5073,"logo_path":null,"name":"WOWOW FILMS","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":9339,"logo_path":"/hwEpOrIYH7G4Rolt7s2thYquJnD.png","name":"Universal Music Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2011-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live in Concert at Sydney Opera House","title":"Simply Red: Farewell","video":true,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":6}
