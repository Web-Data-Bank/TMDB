Using the map “KOWLOON” from the popular video game CALL OF DUTY: BLACK OPS (2010) as a field of study, the filmmaker conducted a yearlong virtual fieldwork: playing, observing and documenting “Hong Kong” as simulated in the video game world. ANOTHER turns the violent first-person shooter into a series of vacant, uncanny and yet meditative tableaux, unearthing a formal poetry that is often overlooked during the original gameplay. It combines methodologies from both the observational and assemblage film traditions in raising questions about cultural representations in contemporary popular media, while at the same time creating evocative metaphors for a post-colonial Hong Kong through the reworking of media materials.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AeBL9zw3vYSavk05PN38T11kVhq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Day of Depression in Kowloon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
