Stripping the images and sound from the original film, the remake retains only the film dialogues in the form of subtitles, rendering the original romantic tale into a hollow and ghostly story. The film dialogues, taken out-of-context and dissociated from the original images, become an allegorical conversation about displacement, alienation and cultural representations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moon is Larger in Peking","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
