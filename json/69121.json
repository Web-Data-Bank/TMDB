She was once a successful surgeon; her husband Arthur (Sanjiban), a brilliant scientist. But now, they exist in a world of emptiness and solitude, continuing the radical artificial intelligence research that Arthur had started a lifetime before. Before the accident. Now, after four years of ceaseless work, they've made a breakthrough, a discovery so great that it could change the face of science. But it will also require a sacrifice so great, that Magdalena's world will never be the same.","popularity":0.613,"poster_path":"/3vGUP1z6DiZOQzeotsDSfpTiV1R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magdalena's Brain","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":6}
