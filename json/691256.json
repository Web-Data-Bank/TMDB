Actually that’s an odd set of things to be into, hypothetical person reading this, and frankly it’s about time you let us get to the point. Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett riffed this vintage 1962 epic live in Nashville, and now you can enjoy the show in the comfort of your own home, castle, or bottle you share with a leprechaun!  Also! The guys riff the supremely weird short What Is Nothing? (spoiler: we still don’t know what nothing is).  Make sure all these giants didn’t die in vain - join Mike, Kevin, and Bill for a full evening of great live comedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sLn8QsbDYJ3hcmbzMIdDcR3pHsf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rifftrax Live: Jack the Giant Killer","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
