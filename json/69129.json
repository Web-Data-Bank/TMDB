Today, every ten thousandth person in the country is a dinosaur, evolved to be human-sized, wearing sophisticated solid-light holographic disguises to maintain the facade, getting stoned off regular cooking herbs like basil, rosemary and tarragon, and living by their own shadow government's laws; any human who stumbles upon them is to be immediately executed. Two dino private investigators, velociraptor Vincent Rubio and triceratops Ernie Watson, are hired by one of Ernie's old girlfriends to find out why her younger brother committed suicide, and discover a dino cult called Voice Of Progress that wants dinokind to come out of the closet and reclaim the planet.","popularity":1.453,"poster_path":"/mgmCyx3MK2S3hINoQNNBDBdpXtr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fox Television Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anonymous Rex","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":17}
