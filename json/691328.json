So who better to present a celebration of Caledonian cursing?  This documentary sees Cora sing, swear and scrutinise why Scotland swears so well. Cora begins with the first hurdle – how does one discuss swear words on the BBC? Aunty Beeb is the institution that has been historically priggish about language - always bleeping words and apologising for those that slipped through. So Cora runs a list past BBC Scotland’s head of editorial standards to see what she can get away with.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rZbzAl4xQns5nCpqbDnx8h22OlR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scotland: Contains Strong Language","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
