He desperately tries to meet someone new, but can't seem to figure out the ever-evolving dating app game. One day a pop-up ad appears for a promising new dating app, and Jake soon finds himself in a comprehensive dating system run by artificial intelligence. The founders, power couple Regina and Plato, show Jake a world where he transforms into different characters to best suit his matches' desires. After multiple successful dates that end in romance, Regina and Plato introduce a more confident Jake to another level of their operation: Santamaria- an exclusive community for dating system recruiters, or 'influencers', who fill their days with sex, drugs, virtual reality, and other sense stimulating pleasures.","popularity":0.697,"poster_path":"/m2s2cD6VwwWEsuBTGI0zqpQefzh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santamaria","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
