For our kick-off tape, we’ve curated an hour-long joyride through the hallowed halls of “behind the scenes” horror.  Our team has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support during these difficult times. So this is our way of saying thanks! The price is set at 99 cents, which is the lowest possible option that Vimeo offers. We want everyone to be able to enjoy this. But if you’re able to donate more to our non-profit mission, there’s also an option to pay what you want.  Thank you for your continued support, and remember: “DIDN’T YOU USED TO BE SATAN?”","popularity":1.62,"poster_path":"/oppipHfmqcOFotl6InYtcGWj1ZT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110219,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Genre Film Archives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"DIDN’T YOU USED TO BE SATAN?","title":"AGFA MYSTERY MIXTAPE #1","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
