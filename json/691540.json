Anaconda stars a pre-fame Jennifer Lopez, a post-fame Eric Stoltz, and an Owen Wilson who even then was somehow ashamed of his role in The Internship despite it not happening for another sixteen years. With the help of Ice Cube they set off into the Amazon in search of those drones they claimed were going to revolutionize package delivery.  Then Eric Stoltz gets stung and paralyzed by a venomous wasp, so things are really looking up for our crew when they encounter Jon Voight. Voight has been obsessed with hunting down a deadly anaconda ever since the snake tricked him into selling his beloved Chrysler LeBaron to George Costanza. From then on, things spiral into a deadly game of cat and mouse, one where the cat is played by a snake, and the mouse is played by Danny Trejo.  And, as if that wasn't enough, at one point the anaconda spits a monkey right at a man’s face! How many movies can say that? Don’t miss out!","popularity":2.04,"poster_path":"/m6y6oQvR3Zb3DwpFtzk40Rro71U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rifftrax Live: Anaconda","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
