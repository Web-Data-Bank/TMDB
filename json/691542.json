Joining the guys are their old cohorts Frank Conniff (TV's Frank), Trace Beaulieu (Crow, Dr. Forrestor), Mary Jo Pehl (Pearl Forrester), Bridget Nelson (Nuveena, Mr. B), as well as Mystery Science Theater 3000 creator Joel Hodgson, AND the host of the revived MST, Jonah Ray, for a hilarious night of riffing for RiffTrax's 20th Live event.  Taking turns in various permutations to riff on a slew of old-timey shorts, the show culminates in a Super Riff-A-Palooza finale with all nine riffers on stage at once!","popularity":0.957,"poster_path":"/4oRuNpDU9hE8dZvTkUgyE62VwkO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RiffTrax Live: MST3K Reunion Show","video":true,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3}
