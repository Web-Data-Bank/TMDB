A thorough study of the situation in rural Latvia over the course of the last thirty years, where the conflict between the familiar and the new, and desire and opportunity has fostered creative thinking in farmers looking to be masters of their own land. In the film we see a German farmer who bought property in Latvia; the head of a large parish; a family of young former citizens; eco lifestyle supporters - soybean growers, including an organic farm and its owner who takes a loan from a bank for the first time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/49auYGcVEwN0rm7lBVA9625EAKI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131973,"logo_path":null,"name":"IK studija","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":122381,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eiropas dokumentālā kino simpoziji","origin_country":""},{"id":37732,"logo_path":"/596Eq7ivA0DpNfB5zzDU7yMeTB4.png","name":"WFDiF","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":100422,"logo_path":"/kVJAD4GjgrZGz2T4nqYRmZzXNkU.png","name":"Rīgas Kinostudija","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2007-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shade of the Oak Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
