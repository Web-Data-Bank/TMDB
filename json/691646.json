But everything went wrong. Actors quit and there isn't even a camera anymore. He finds an envelope in his postbox which contains a letter and a black pill. The anonymous sender writes that the addressee left the black pill at his place and then wishes him goodbye forever. Our unlucky guy needs some drinks. As he is leaving the flat he contemplates the black pill sitting on the table. In a split second he swallows it down. He finally leaves the house, but what is now happening? Could it be that this will be his last night on earth? What about these fragments and visions that seem to be connected in some way to his failed film project?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ywkwyCmYdqYvA9e4XPD1Uo0Dkhi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Loser!","title":"A Deathtrip in Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
