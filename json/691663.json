Presenting artworks with reduced economies, the book, a 1972 Arts Council publication entitled Systems, includes drawings, documentation of works, and photographs of the artists in the ‘British Systems group’, along with extended texts written by each of them. The video’s imagery is derived from recording both the object of the book and the images it contains. The videography employs experimental, high contrast exposures that will cause white pages to bleach away almost entirely, and black pages to intensify so that they become suggestive of spaces rather than surfaces; so that the diagrams/images on those pages seem to float in voids.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cg4aPVyWy5dWLQWrQIh33xiakyS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
