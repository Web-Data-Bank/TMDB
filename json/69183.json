Both are inspiring stories and that’s what it’s all about. I liked the film a lot. Both fighters pour their hearts out and we get a fantastic look at their strengths but also their vulnerabilities and fears.","popularity":1.422,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Striking Truth","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":6}
