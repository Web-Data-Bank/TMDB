Little is known of Gloria, not an actor but a client, she has become a mythic and fictionalised figure, decoded and continuously dissected within a film used as a teaching aid and historical archival record. In his filmed interview with Gloria, Perls demonstrates Gestalt therapy techniques. A term he coined, 'Gestalt therapy', is an existential, experiential form of psychotherapy that emphasizes personal responsibility, and that focuses upon the individual's experience in the present moment, and the self-regulating adjustments people make as a result of their overall situation. The voices mediated through the body of the performer are caught in an opaque, intriguing and morally uncertain looping dynamic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bgRWOmINGDs8ictWX5ftOxdsn4g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gloria","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
