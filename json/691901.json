A hilarious and heartbreaking show that walks you through the razor edges of a life stripped bare. How you deal with losing everything, what Buddhists do with rage and how bubble blowers work at funerals. Savage talks about things that are actually sad and also very funny.","popularity":1.927,"poster_path":"/m6lniByN4vMIfxL2gdiqUstxeFI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20580,"logo_path":"/oRR9EXVoKP9szDkVKlze5HVJS7g.png","name":"Amazon Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice Fraser: Savage","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":3}
