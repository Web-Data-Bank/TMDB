And it is with pyrotechnic art and fireworks that man's ancient relationship with fire is celebrated. The firework has a cathartic function, it removes the specter of war through the ritualized use of its most striking components: the din, the danger, the distant lights in the night. It also appears that pyrotechnics are closely linked to exorcism from the danger of volcanic eruptions: the firework free from the presence of evil spirits, which popular belief evokes in volcanic areas. Il Fuoco di Napoli traces the story of a man, Giuseppe Scudo, and his passion, the fireworks. His art and his life are one for him. This Neapolitan blaster challenges danger with clarity and intelligence. His work is a delicate alchemy of ancient knowledge, imagination and courage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IL FUOCO DI NAPOLI","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
