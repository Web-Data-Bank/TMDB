A young woman invited me to the place she was raised. She went there to confront the silence that she had fled some years earlier. Little by little, between the two of us, a third character appears: a thief. My mother always wrote in secret. At fifty years old, she breaks the long silence and publishes her first book. We go back to the origin of her speech, forty years earlier. What did she lose by coming out of the silence ? Kustavi is a \"documentary-novel\" whose voice over, written in Alexandrians, transforms it into an investigation. We discover the dispossession once it has already taken everything away. Three existential quests come together little by little.
