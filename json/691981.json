Her straw handbag still hanging on a door of her room, the cuckoo of the room, the wicker rocking chair, her colored combs resting in the bathroom near the mirror, the Sardinian carpets, the flowers that Angela always puts on the kitchen table, the reeds dancing with the wind. Joyce's house in Fermo, in the Marche region, is a house that breathes life, a life many times dramatic but also rich in poetry. The period of exile with Emilio Lussu in Paris, the struggles of women in Sardinia, the translations of poets who wrote \"useful poetry\", the one that comes directly, without too many words, to the knowledge of other realities and to sentiment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La mia casa e i miei coinquilini","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
