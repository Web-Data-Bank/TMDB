Has it become a capitalist product? What about the phenomenon in Latin America? Is punk dead?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p1xOGqSoVhKuN7iAGP8rR5aP5J2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Generaci贸n Anti Todo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
