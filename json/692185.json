Foremost amongst the drivers were Nelson Piquet, Alain Prost, Patrick Tambay and Ren√© Arnoux.  The main change for the season was the complete ban on ground effect aerodynamics, with a mandatory flat undertray introduced to limit the downforce. As turbos increased the available power, teams struggled to find a working formula to make cars driveable as well as fast.  Nevertheless Nelson Piquet and Brabham-BMW became the first to win with a turbocharged engine, setting the trend that was to continue until the turbo ban.  With a quirky commentary, all the drama, action and spectacle is condensed into one breathtaking review package.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1qUilT6lG014JazDT4fxKA2kG67.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1983","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
