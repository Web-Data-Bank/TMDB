Lebanese truck driver, Derar Nsseir, transports goods across Syria, Jordan and all the way to other countries. Meanwhile, Mohamad Mehani, an Egyptian, drives across Egypt and to the Sudanese border delivering necessities. Yet these two have one thing in common: making a living in ever-changing scenery on an asphalt road that stretches miles across the Arab world. 'Asphalt' takes us on a journey to examine closely the subtle relationship between man and machine, and provides a reflection on life from behind the wheel.  —Hammoud, Ali","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gMMzmS6Yl7eyOkd4P31HWU5Hf3t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asphalt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
