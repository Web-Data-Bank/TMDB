It's the perfect ambiance to enjoy all of the hits from her unprecedented cinematic debut album \"Deleted Scenes From The Cutting Room Floor\" live. With an orchestra dressed to kill, as usual, a large string- and hornsection, a handsome vaudevillian MC and a venue packed from pilar to post, you'll hear the amazing Ms. Emerald deliver all the hits and favourites including \"Back It Up\", \"A Night Like This\", \"That Man\" and an amazing rendition of \"Stuck\". It also features the previously unreleased \"Close To You\" and \"Two Hearts\", both available here for the first time anywhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oFJaZ2oA90PrLSBEP04YzAs8FgH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Clear The Way, Boys, The Lady Has Arrived !","title":"Caro Emerald With The Grandmono Orchestra - Live In Concert At The Heineken Music Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
