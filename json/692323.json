Mother and daughter. A successful young filmmaker and a child with clear ideas about how to make a film. Together they make a long journey to meet members of their large family: From Paris to Tehran and further beyond the Afghanistan border. By air, train, car, they never leave the tools of their trade: two video cameras, one of which is so small that it goes by unseen. On the way, they encounter landscapes, villages, voices and faces, too long separated by distance or disparate destinies. Travel time, story time: at night, Sepideh transforms their story into a bedtime lullaby for her daughter. The complex ramifications of a genealogical tree are gathered in a subtle family album.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yg2pQr3nhCmu9PmI734UC3agwKX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A mother and daughter travel borders in Iran, France, and Afghanistan to visit family.","title":"Harat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
