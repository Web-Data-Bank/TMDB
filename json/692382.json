This film is determined to be the ‘film on space’ of our times, an epic theater, the general observation of the geological structure of this time.  I therefore invent or re-invent some terms for my purpose:  Archae(now)logy; Ruinology; space bankruptcy; theater of life -- theater of cruelty -- theater of spectacle; the body-film; the New Berlin Wall - Iron Curtain; and “refugees without camps”, ‘the plants”, “the ghosts,” the asthenosphere, dark energy...  I have stolen a great amount of found footages/ready materials or already existed films. This “stealing” is exactly the way to get connected with history and the history of film, to construct an “echo film”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7rnfscUL0xUqxMKCI3PKOFMRyMO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":264,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stratum 2: The Asthenosphere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
