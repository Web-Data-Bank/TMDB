Silvia (Antonia Santilli) is a daddy's girl who has wanted to have a drug experience only once, but this was enough for her parents to batten down the hatches, on the advice of a doctor, isolating the girl into a luxurious hotel in Sardinia and being vigilant on her \"healing\". It's out of season, there're almost no people in the compound. But a strange young man is roaming around there, maybe a fugitive, who Silvia starts to have a relationship with. This young man is the figure by whom Roberto Natale clarifies, using him as a reagent, the real key relation, the core of narration, the focus of the movie, which is the link between Silvia and her father.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/6BzMAMsf6kaNY1Z6M7Ob5EGQerA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elis Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1972-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il mio corpo con rabbia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
