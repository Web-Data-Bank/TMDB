EJ suffers from a rare degenerative eye disease called Choroideremia, and several years ago, he was diagnosed as legally blind. However, instead of wallowing in self-pity, EJ has responded positively to his misfortune, and he's now doing everything in his power to help raise awareness and funding for a possible cure. EJ's journey while running these marathons is an inspiring tale of strength overcoming adversity, and it's ultimately a reminder that one person can indeed make a difference.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fkW7gBP3G9kK1lAUjsSi0fNhO2j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running Blind","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
