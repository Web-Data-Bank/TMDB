Set against the breathtaking, azure vistas of the Greek Isles, the film merges a contemporary archeological “detective story” with some of the most advanced and painstaking digital re-creations ever undertaken for an IMAX® theatre film, with scenes that restore such centuries-old spectacles as the original Parthenon and the volcanic eruption that buried Santorini in 1646 BC.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":"/41SrHY01jFrfAsASljSls45CVNe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2753,"logo_path":null,"name":"MacGillivray Freeman Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Museum of Civilization","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Come along on a great new adventure","title":"Greece: Secrets of the Past","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
