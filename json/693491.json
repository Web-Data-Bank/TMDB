Behind closed doors at the famous Bournville plant, a team of dedicated scientists struggle to meet the biggest challenge the company's faced for a century - to dramatically cut sugar from their Dairy Milk recipe. Meanwhile, the firm's Easter Creme Egg campaign finds Cadbury agents 'reverse shoplifting' as they hide prize-winning white eggs around the country. Elsewhere in the factory new flavours of chocolate are put into production, with wacky recipes invented by lucky members of the public.","popularity":1.367,"poster_path":"/rKzq4OspaDfOTrN0TGTKtH9ZoBE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whitworth Media Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Cadbury: Chocolate Secrets Unwrapped","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
