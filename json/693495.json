From his clan, the White Heron, only two families remain in Peru. Rember's paintings are inspired by the stories his grandmother Martha told him before she died. However, he has never dived into the darkest part of his nation’s history: the indigenous massacre during the rubber boom. Martha is a survivor of the horror and she speaks to Rember in dreams guiding him in a spiritual journey back to the jungle. He first visits his parents, who are also artists, in the Peruvian jungle. And finally, he sails to La Chorrera, in Colombia, where he confronts the past and meets other members of his clan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pXXAqo2YRpORKF9W88MCfW793Ge.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160022,"logo_path":null,"name":"Travesia Films","origin_country":""},{"id":160024,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jacalito Films","origin_country":""},{"id":49060,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Mula Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2020-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Song of the Butterflies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
