Asnaketch lived her life on the edge of her artistry, over the edge of her passions. She brought high standards to theater and excitement to music in conservative Ethiopia in the 1950's-60's. Her gift and transparent nature made her infectious to audiences not only in Ethiopia but also around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7GncYWDvVThvnoOMhzsGds7c4mk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ASNI: the Life of Asnaketch Worku - Courage, Passion & Glamor in Ethiopia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
