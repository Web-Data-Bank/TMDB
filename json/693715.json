S. Air Force plane. The material has been edited into a loop that repeats in variations: magenta and green, with motion blurs applied to each individual frame, some blurs parallel to the horizon line in the shot, and others perpendicular to it. The result is a visually complex movie with stroboscopic sequences that are a challenge to the eye.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dGNBA0XTKcJ7knjoaGIJMmDBZkX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spatial Disorientation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
