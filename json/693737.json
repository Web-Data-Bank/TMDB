But his uncle and aunt don’t like to hear him thinking of such things, and plan to murder him and take his throne. Caspian’s tutor, Dr. Cornelius manages to save him, and not only teach him about the old ways, but bring him into the real Narnia and introduce him to the real Narnia. But Caspian’s plight is desperate, and he must use the legendary horn to call help from another world: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.  Then, Lucy and Edmund are sent back to Narnia, along with their cousin Eustace, to assist Caspian on a voyage. Along their journey the children battle dragons and sea serpents, and sail across a golden lake to reach the edge of the world.","popularity":1.61,"poster_path":"/wK7Sn9z7Hq3CYMezbePkDyYvz85.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5833,"logo_path":"/en43paibhhmVHseOknSoOgyZDte.png","name":"Morningstar Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21645,"logo_path":null,"name":"WonderWorks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian & The Voyage of the Dawn Treader","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5}
