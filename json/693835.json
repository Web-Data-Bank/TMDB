Теория струн","overview":"Nikita Nekrasov is a scientist, a theoretical physicist who studies our world and other possible worlds. He refuses to make a choice between mathematics and physics, between one woman and another, as he ponders the existence of the multi-universe. At scientific conferences, attended by eminent foreign scientists and a rising younger generation of physicists alike, Nekrasov gets carried away debating the beauty of string theory. He attempts to explain to all of his women – Katya, the librarian, Zoya, the scientific secretary, Svetalana, the head of department – about the theory of his own polygamy, and the possibility of having enough feelings to satisfy everyone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/skpbx5Y3oLN7y3CrrPk7pZsNgaS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phenomen Berlin Filmproduktions (DE)","origin_country":""},{"id":132266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phenomen Ukraine","origin_country":""},{"id":123308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phenomen Films","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DAU.
