Now, in their third and final year, Alice, Shinobu, Aya, and Yoko have truly become the best of friends and even Karen, Honoka, and Kana are part of the gang as well. But since it's their last year, that means their time will be split between preparing for the big senior trip to Nara and Kyoto, and trying to make plans for whatever is to come next in their lives… and in Shinobu's case, that may mean something so amazing that she'd never even dared to dream it!
