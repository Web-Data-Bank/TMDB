One of the most beloved VEGGIETALES characters is the cucumber LarryBoy, a mild-mannered janitor who transforms into a plunger-clad superhero to save the residents of Bumblyburg. This collection includes two classic LarryBoy adventures: LARRYBOY & THE FIB FROM OUTER SPACE (1997), in which a little white lie ends up causing big trouble; and LARRYBOY & THE RUMOR WEED (1999), an important lesson about the power of gossip. The volume also features DAVE & THE GIANT PICKLE (1996), a retelling of the Biblical story of David and Goliath; as well as four LarryBoy cartoons rendered in traditional line-drawn animation.","popularity":0.634,"poster_path":"/tvMOXnsM0pusOlIZP8YlVCzw2yG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3204,"logo_path":"/gOYYJkapxRWBg1SiOAJ24DisVaq.png","name":"Big Idea Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VeggieTales: The Bumblyburg Super-Hero Value Pack","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
