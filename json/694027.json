This moving documentary takes us on a journey from Upstate New York State to Montreal and Kahnawake; from Washington State to New Mexico, as we follow St. Kateri's incredible journey of deep faith, heroic sacrifice and love of Christ. Featuring many people who have been touched by her -including the little boy who received the miraculous healing that led to her canonization, this splendid film shows that no one is too simple or too young to follow Christ.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ppCLUFEw6BtWVztig7skHXnr2Ts.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132323,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salt and Light Catholic Media Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Her Footsteps: The Story of Kateri Tekakwitha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
