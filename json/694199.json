Deftly experimental and wonderfully efficient, Zhang captures the liberation and the torment of being away – from home and from the expectations of daughter- and sisterhood. The work is not afraid to be loud, claiming a speaking and cinematic voice, and calling attention to the visibility of personal histories and anguished transnational futures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Sister Swallowed the Zoo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
