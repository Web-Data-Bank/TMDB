The reservation is built on a polluted lake which is a tourist attraction. In Lorado there are many forms of love and every one keeps a pet. The story turns on the suicide of Fashionetteâ€™s fish, because of bad water conditions, and ends with a large scale chemical fire. This project took over three years to produce and all of the images are computer generated and animated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qaWxeqM7TTUv4gE48R4iCjY1X2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maxwell's Demon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
