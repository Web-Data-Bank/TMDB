Writes Schneemann: \"I think of this work as an exploded canvas, units of rapidly changing clusters. A flow of energy which makes an active audience inevitable and necessary — not to mimic the performance, but to absorb relations within the space and between one another — to be correspondent to the materials and imagery, grasping a conscious and realizable wish to replace the performers with themselves.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1L3nBQFD9douEDLD23Mw3XKFPlB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Illinois Central Transposed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
