It sustains aspects of Schneemann's previous works built with dream instruction, positing the interchange of intimacy and physicality, the erotic and the obscene, the incubation of dream enactment. Catscan centers on the death of a beloved cat as a means to ritualize more universal mourning and to bring forward ghosts of the past. As a ritual consecration, Schneemann, blindfolded, dances out of 20 yards of red fabric wound around her body.  The performance, which had a duration of approximately 90 minutes and variously featured 5 to 8 performers, included a slide projection system, 15 video monitors, ladders, furniture, suitcases, and debris.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xidc1nbjFO9wdfH0HVen3VT6Dxs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catscan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
