This video presents the consistent relocation of these themes to suggest a cumulative continuity; from montage to montage, each motif is readjusted, repositioned, dismembered and remembered in new contexts. This video includes documentation of four installations: Venus Vectors (1989-98), Cycladic Imprints (1989-92), Scroll Paintings with Exploded TV (1990-91) and Video Rocks(1989-92).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ai9zk3sZ8n7wBcoFz1xZ2po7psA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Recent Installations","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
