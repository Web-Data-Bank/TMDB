From the neon glow of Hollywood to the sun-drenched boardwalk of Venice Beach, fixed-gear has evolved into a vibrant street culture that is uniquely L.A. From director David Rowe (Fast Friday) comes a new documentary feature that explores a side of L.A. few outsiders have seen. From races through rush-hour traffic to midnight loft parties, To Live &amp; Ride in L.A. is a fast paced-trip through the busy streets and back-alleys of one of the world's largest cities. To Live &amp; Ride in L.A. features talented local riders tearing up the streets with first-time visitor Keo Curry (Fast Friday, Macaframa) - one of the living legends of the sport. Bike to hidden spots off the map, race a midnight alley-cat, keep pace with the riders from Wolfpack, and hang with the local crews, graffiti artists and other L.A. personalities burning up the fixed-gear scene.","popularity":0.997,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Live & Ride in L.A.","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
