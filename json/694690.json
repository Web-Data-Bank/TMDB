When she gets up to answer it, there’s no one there. The next morning the entire house smells of sour milk. The hours pass.  The woman’s thoughts appear as subtitles on the screen. A voice attempts to simultaneously translate these subtitles into Swedish. The voice hesitates, stumbles and sometimes fails. The gaps between thoughts and words fill the empty rooms of a small house.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Six ans","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":3}
