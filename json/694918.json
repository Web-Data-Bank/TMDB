Juxtaposing African and American landscapes, personal and media imagery, he traces a spiritual and physical journey that moves from from Harlem to Goree Island, Cape Verde and Tanzania. In a forceful portrait of cultural disenfranchisement that refers to the African diaspora and the bitter harvest sown by slavery, he challenges the veracity of mass cultural images of African-Americans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2W0gSw1MYFjqwUUS9hXc002JyvP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nor Was This All By Any Means","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
