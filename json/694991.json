Shot via Skype, it features those whose work was slated to screen at festivals like SXSW, CPH:DOX, Tribeca, First Look, and more. The documentary depicts a broad range of filmmakers, each sequestered in their own spaces in locations throughout North America, Europe, Africa, and beyond, responding to a question first posed by Wim Wenders in his classic 1982 documentary experiment Room 666, and perhaps newly resonant today: “Is cinema becoming a dead language—an art form which is already in decline?”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Room H.264: Quarantine, April 2020","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
