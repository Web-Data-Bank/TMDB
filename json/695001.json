But the bandits are car thieves, the cowboy is a car guard, the cattle are cars and the cowboy's muse a barmaid. The theft sends Cowboy Dan on a mission to retrieve the car and find justice in the criminal underworld of Cape Town, with Zancas - a scared hobo - as his only help and unlikely sidekick. \"Cowboy Dan\" is a reinterpretation of the classic Western with a Cape flavour through the eyes of a modern \"Man from La Mancha\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cowboy Dan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
