An international team, made up of some of the best climbers in the world, attempts this ascent. After a long journey in their canoes along the jungle river, their project takes them to live on the wall for a fortnight, in very bad and dangerous conditions. Heavy floods, constant humidity, food rationing, technical difficulties as well as the hardest mental and physical effort seem to place the ascent beyond their possibilities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amazonian Vertigo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
