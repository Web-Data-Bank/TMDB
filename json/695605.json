But for this very reason he sees ways everywhere. Where others encounter walls or mountains, there, too, he sees a way. But because he sees a way everywhere, he has to clear things from it everywhere. Not always by brute force; sometimes by the most refined. Because he sees ways everywhere, he always stands at a crossroads. No moment can know what the next will bring. What exists he reduces to rubble – not for the sake of rubble, but for that of the way leading through it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aJXVnwrqnY9tHCQwBxVFeXfjL0L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89713,"logo_path":null,"name":"88 Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":14565,"logo_path":null,"name":"Katasia Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Way Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
