Shot by drone and 4K camera over 1400 m above sea level, the frames function as a visual journey through the peaks of the Mt and green wooded areas, but the video presents a journey from a twisted perspective. Scenes of spectacular natural scenery, partially colored to evoke the surreal surface of planet Earth and open the door to a World “on the other side of the view”. With this video collage, Zelenika creates a kind of ultimate meditative haven, with ideal conditions for the process of immersing oneself in times of broken privacy, pervasive panopticon and inflation of information.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rBcBjTuSeG0vlZe8PSjSk4bkH71.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91093,"logo_path":null,"name":"104 Films","origin_country":""},{"id":150942,"logo_path":null,"name":"biggerhouse film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Introversion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
