In this one-man comedy, Urie plays Alex More, who is down on his luck after being recently fired from Disneyland. He lands a job curating the basement of Barbra Streisand. Urie streamed this performance live from his own living room during the COVID-19 quarantine.","popularity":0.857,"poster_path":"/80rmzEKpppulYH5PKrubhefL7y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130371,"logo_path":"/wt1ck1XNmLp8OvVsHdJ5mo2bdRO.png","name":"Broadway.com","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buyer and Cellar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
