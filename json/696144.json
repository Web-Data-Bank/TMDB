These two renowned, married entomologists now grapple with Parkinson’s in their twilight years and realize a chapter of discovery and exploration is coming to a close in their lives. But Charlie and Lois live in a time when the beleaguered field of science needs them most, and the O'Briens know they need to keep fighting for the value of scientific knowledge. So they turn to their insects for a little help...  This humorous and poignant documentary explores the love of Nature and the nature of Love--and what it means to completely devote oneself to both.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cI2JIzrsfyuVwwtoU2rrE4akqrk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Love Bugs","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
