The ramp becomes a source of creative movement. Dancers can move in ways that they cannot move on flat surfaces and the ramp itself becomes an artistic object, transformed albeit temporarily into an environment that reveals connection, trust, beauty, and desire. Choreographed, directed, and shot from disability perspectives, this dance-on-video delves into the playful connection enabled where disability, community, and ramp meet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uDuTov2t4kyRnyzsG92ofh09W6U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inclinations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
