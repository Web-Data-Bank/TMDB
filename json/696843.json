As he strolls among the flowers, herbs and vegetables, there's a war for survival raging around him: from dangerous daddy longlegs and ferocious fire ants, to an eight-eyed jumping spider in a wrestling match with a belligerent bee. There's even a Top Gun-style air battle between a praying mantis and a bat. In this terrifying-and funny-new natural history comedy, National Geographic filmmakers use state-of-the-art cinematography to reveal what the world looks like from the insect's point of view.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xHIfpg6gXmQ7kN3HjitlkFxbbzm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic: The Savage Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
