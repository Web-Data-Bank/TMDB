A customer enters and takes his seat in the chair. The barber places the cloth about his neck, sharpens his razor, and then goes mad. He seizes a huge knife, cuts the man's head off, and takes it to a table some distance away. There he lathers and shaves the face; then taking the head back to the chair, he places it in his proper position on the trunk. The customer thereupon rises, none the worse for his experience, pays his bill, and leaves the shop.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dIwOC7PCk4Xa2KwYz4cUVjowdmz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope \u0026 Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1899-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Maniac Barber","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
