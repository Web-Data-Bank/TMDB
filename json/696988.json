Piasta has spent time with older people in Berwick, listening to stories about life in the town and using this to inform a series of oral history interviews with older people – many who have lived in Berwick all their life. While the images in the films reveal a landscape that often seems unchanged, the narrative reveals fragments of forgotten stories and traditions, skills and working lives no longer of value in today’s society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5BLtcMtxQyoetmdxv7SvsTnKFAF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thelma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
