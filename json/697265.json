The film shows a bizarre world whose laws are quite different from what we are used to. The behaviour is different, the relationships unfold differently and the humour takes on different notes. The heroes wake up and fall asleep, rejoice and cry, always feeling that the recording may end at any moment.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/v3sY52a3eSdvIv8vGc5khcHWHKu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117001,"logo_path":"/tLhSGNNKX4VwCNbvPMissO3ea5j.png","name":"Babylon'13","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War Note","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
