He casts Father to play himself. What starts as an act of love and ambition — filmmaking to more deeply understand the self, and the other — spirals into a process which confronts Father’s struggles with addiction and his life devoid of his son. EL FATHER PLAYS HIMSELF holds a steady lens to the way the act of cinema unearths, binds, heals and destroys.","popularity":0.733,"poster_path":"/pyR2mrMNdffm3MjOPtltVUminPH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rake Films","origin_country":""},{"id":14629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ardimages","origin_country":""},{"id":103029,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Faena","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2020-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A father and son return to the Amazon jungle to shoot a deeply personal film.
