A wonderful experience with a first-class teamwork. The only movie whose screenplay was written by someone other than myself. Thank you to Adel Tabrizi, who gave me his screenplay that year, and thank you to Saba Ghasemi, who brought us all together as a producer to create an interesting experience for all of us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/szDlFc1OZiIilQDpL06ywZsbblZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tribune","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
