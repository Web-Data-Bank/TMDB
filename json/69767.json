While working in the lab, he accidentally drinks coffee that has been contaminated by a virus-infected gecko. He soon finds himself doing the most insane things, such as sticking to walls, making chirping cicak noises and adding bugs to his menu. He turns to his best friend and apartment mate, Danny (Yusry Abdul Halim), and begs him to find the reason behind his strange antics.

Suspecting something amiss, Hairi and Danny launch their own investigation and discover that Professor Klon is not only the creator of such viruses, but also has a more sinister plan up his sleeve, backed by his business partners, the Ginger Boys Ramlie and AC Mizal, who first tend to take revenge on Professor Klon's failed experiment on them; making their senses turn abnormal.","popularity":0.775,"poster_path":"/A3m4bV7qA8EkyZIiw6cZG07ugCa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2006-12-07","revenue":1,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cicakman","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
