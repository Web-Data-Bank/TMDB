The film detailed abuse suffered by children between the 1930s and 1970s in the state childcare system of Ireland, primarily in the Reformatory and Industrial Schools. After public outcry, Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern apologised on behalf of the State. The film sparked a national scandal over abuse of children in church and state run institutions.
