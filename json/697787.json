He spends his life in improvised landfills among what remains of leftovers. Worlds apart, yet close-by, there is Stanley. He tidies the church in exchange for a monetised hospitality, picks fruits, herds sheep: anything that keep his foreign body busy. Oscar, the young Sicilian, and Stanley the Nigerian donâ€™t seem to have much in common. Except for the feeling of being thrown into the world, to suffer the same refusal, the same overwhelming wave of choices imposed on them by others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qxh0l41mBVfI5lsXZD14sDucSSy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94506,"logo_path":"/pSTfyFTD439qICCIoycPg3LvVAU.png","name":"Kino Produzioni","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":57432,"logo_path":"/87nyzjM86z0wopuV63t3NjnCpu2.png","name":"Close Up Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2021-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Body","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
