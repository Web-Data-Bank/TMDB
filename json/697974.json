A young Solondz stars in the 10-minute short as geeky high schooler Ezra Schatt, a neurotic, primitive headcase of the young Woody Allen variety. Buried under thick, unseemly glasses and an endlessly dazed expression, Ezra’s worst enemy is basketball. Unable to make a single basket under the brutal pressures of his vulgar gym teacher (“You’re shit, Schatt!”), Ezra also fails at both impressing the cheerleader of his dreams and realizing his aspirations of attending MIT.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b8Be2UdvjeSpbmp5EMRApL9xcdK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schatt's Last Shot","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
