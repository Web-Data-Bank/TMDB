The footage originates from former socialist Czechoslovakia and the artist here attempts to depict, by revealing the creative process, how this epoch may be read. Non-traditional instruments are used here, such as, for instance, randomness. Its impact on the form of the subsequent description of socialism highlights the thought processes and their certain salience as a template.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ugRlV3yZmWODZeQ71s4qVK6FUJ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Working Process","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
