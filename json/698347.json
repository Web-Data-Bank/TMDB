All 13 of rallysport's most famous races are covered, from Monte Carlo to Harrogate. On-board cameras show the teams battling through sleet, snow, gravel and mud, while helicopter cameras capture the action from the air. Alex Fiorio was in fine form driving a Jolly Club Lancia. Frenchmen Bruno Saby and Didier Auriol each won one title round, while the Spaniard Carlos Sainz was probably the most spectacular driver of the year in his Ford Sierra. Crowd favourites Kankkunen, Alen and Mikkola were a force to be reckoned with, in what became an epic showdown between the old and new.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WRC 1988 - FIA World Rally Championship","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
