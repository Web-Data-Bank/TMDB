Together they have created large-scale shows already before. \"Ruja\", a rock-opera, and \"Unified Estonia\", a convention of a fictitious political movement for 7200 viewers, were not only completely sold out, but also theatre events, which won the major theatre prizes in Estonia. \"The Rise and Fall of Estonia\" is not a rock-opera. It's not a punk statement. It's a symphony. And it's about Estonia.  Together with actors from NO99 they've created over the years four productions, which more or less deal with Estonia and its state of mind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2XqcMAOA8UExcVJgG2CkyLelXjy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70100,"logo_path":null,"name":"NO99","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rise And Fall Of Estonia","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
