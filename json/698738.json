The project develops from a number of previous projects Byrne has realised, each of which similarly engage a collective amnesia about our shifting cultural history, through dramatic re-enactments of culturally loaded conversations and interviews gleaned from discarded popular magazines. With Homme à Femmes (Michel Debrane) Byrne focuses on a generically candid encounter with Sartre, which discusses his relationship with women throughout his life, at a moment towards the end of that life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fo7kcmxLQJfmX8r3DJ82bG8GyVO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hommes a Femmes (Michel Debrane)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
