This is the story of the long and difficult journey that followed. Told through the lens of one Bon teacher born in exile -- Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche -- this film reveals something very precious and very old: a rich spiritual heritage, hidden for millennia, whose secret teachings are only now becoming known to the world. There may be no unbroken spiritual tradition more ancient than Bon, which traces its beginnings to a buddha who predates Shakyamuni by thousands of years. Yet this tradition today may be facing its greatest challenge thus far: to preserve its rich heritage beyond the land of its birth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2egCBS4ZBO1B1EvN2gS85sMDf2q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116583,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kino","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Light of the Golden Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
