Trapped in Oh Kwang-soo's world, Soon-i wants to escape the room as she feels as if she is being raised, watched and tamed like a pet with her abduction.  Soon-i wants a lover, someone who will love her completely, and not a sex partner.  Ma Dal-jin, a colleague and pornographic webtoon writer, adores Kwang-soo.  While he acknowledges Kwang-soo's mentality, whether he is real or virtual, he is also confused by his multiple personalities.  Soon-i, who eventually ran away, returns to Kwang-soo's World, confessing that her memory loss manipulated her to get other people's attention and love. Ironically, she dreams of moving to a bigger house (Garden of Eden) with the money she earned from selling herself...  Two people dreaming of true love. Can they live happily ever after?","popularity":1.206,"poster_path":"/zXZ6yNLIhRse3mG8SySK8itLmpq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Wife: Wife's Experience","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
