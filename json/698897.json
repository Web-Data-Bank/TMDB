From his taciturn delivery to his creative expression of the beauty that surrounds him, Whiting is the human embodiment of Martha's Vineyard, the island in which his roots run deep, and from which he derives his inspiration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4NStmxjkcTpwv2fMp0E2bCXm0TN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salt and Sugar Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":24838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Morse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Painter Who Farms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
