My ulterior motive prior to making this film was to basically bring a few of my filmmakers/friends together from the Philadelphia area and give everyone the chance to meet... network... create...collaborate. I just wanted everyone to hang out and have a good time. My goal was to make this film as minimalistic as possible while maintaining the true essence, pleasure and bond that comes from walking ones companion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gkXYnzIeX2EOahBgr9Cf32z4y6a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rola Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A man and his companion take a midnight stroll through the city streets of Philadelphia.","title":"A Walk With Harry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
