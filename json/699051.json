Wolfson is not content to play by the rules of a conservative self-policing art market that favors the status quo, instead preferring to make us squirm as he engages a host of lightning-rod issues facing our society today; homophobia, misogyny, racism, white nationalism, antisemitism and violence to name but a few. Wolfson is an art maker on the world stage whose immersive works take on todayâ€™s endemic virtue signaling and politically correct narratives, veritably throwing it all back into our faces.","popularity":0.921,"poster_path":"/qBW43CoZidBMZqHPbaV0BTpvj8u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Summitridge Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spit Earth: Who is Jordan Wolfson?","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
