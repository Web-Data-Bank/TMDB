Two ‘underemployed hipsters’ take on a challenge set by ‘the richest living artist’: visit all eleven galleries around the world showing his spot paintings while the exhibition is on, and win a print made by his assistants and signed by him. The two figured out a way to do the trip for less than what they would eventually be able sell the print for, and turn a profit, or at least break even…if they manage to make it. 72 Trees explores the absurdity of markets, the people they meet on their journey and the aftermath.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9YVKYEEZo0H2qT1yLMZ3oW6ij4l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"72 Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
