This inspiriting story touches the lives of those who embrace it, as Sybil embraces her brothers and sisters and confronts the challenges before her. She stands courageously and boldly with determination, with her father, Col. Henry Ludington, as he faces the “price on his head” by the British. A movie that will inspire your family and the youth of today and go after everything before them with determination and courage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AaPBIwvHfvQ24tuCCj93FzWfFsv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sybil Ludington","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
