Meanwhile, a serial killer, dressed vaguely as a leopard stalks the city of Santa Fe, looking for new victims.  â€‹Loosely based on Jacques Tourneur's 1943 horror film The Leopard Man, They Cry by Night abstracts the original thriller on the horrors of Spanish/American colonialism into a portrait of 21st century Santa Fe, complete with angsty millennials, economic anxiety, and failed revolution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/im4rddD9FBMWPe6TXDGOkb2YrxC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Cry by Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
