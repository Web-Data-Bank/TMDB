Many theories have been put forth by religious leaders, scientists, philosophers, writers, artists, and countless others. None of the theories have held the test of time because there is a central fact, a hidden truth so powerful it almost transcends comprehension. It is so shocking, few dare imagine it. To keep this secret question hidden countless people throughout the centuries have been misled, manipulated, lied to, and even slaughtered, their lives ruined to benefit the ruling class. The most powerful and successful people on earth do not want you to know these truths, because it would undermine their control over the earth's population of sheeple. Once this incredible truth sweeps the world, nothing will be the same. Don't be left behind on this one.
