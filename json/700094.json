Of his 7 ambitious films, 5 were made under the heavy hand of censors in the Soviet Union. In 1984 he defected to Italy with help from screenwriter Tonino Guerra, and Director Michelangelo Antonioni. He directed 2 films in the West until his untimely death in Paris at age 54. Narrated by Oleg Vidov, combined with a collection of rare film excerpts and photos, and interviews from people who knew him best, we take you on a passionate journey into the life, love, and work of Andrei Tarkovsky.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bONRRUBwzPPzmpkBGyYmk5dsQkC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"tarkovsky time within time","title":"Tarkovsky: Time Within Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
