By outfitting herself with over-the-top costumes, heavy makeup, a foul mouth and a passion for the nightlife she became the most notorious denizen of Johannesburg's decadent clubland in the seventies and eighties. The story of Granny Lee is a fascinating journey that merges the personal with the political. It is a life of illusion, glamour and struggle in the shadow of the racial and sexual repression of Calvinist Apartheid.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mBPxmmIrHgPwExcUPHh7thKClXO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metamorphosis: The Remarkable Journey of Granny Lee","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
