Born with a gold spoon in his mouth, he chose a different life than the royal family wanted. He took a political and professional position and went his own way. Eugen became the painting prince and built his own palace at Waldemarsudde which he gave away after his death. Prince Eugen has just turned 150 and celebrated his anniversary at Waldemarsudde, the castle at Djurgården that he left to the Swedes. The Prince's path to independence and creation was crooked. As the youngest son in the Bernadotte family, the son was to become an officer. Of course, what others found, of course, to choose life partners and occupations, Eugen relinquished. But life as an artist and at the same time as a representative of the royal family gave him no rest. Did he succeed in his painting just because he was a prince? He didn't feel at home anywhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/heOfTxbVc9IkzxvwdMvzLmzvdYv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eugen: The Red Prince","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
