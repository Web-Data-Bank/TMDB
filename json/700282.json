I allow Google's \"popular searches\" algorithm to predict what comes after the phrase and peruse the results based on what Google thinks I want to search for in a Black girl. The algorithm generates results based on the most popular searches so it can be theorized that the Black girls that the algorithm predicts are the Black girls we are searching for.\" - Terence Nance.
