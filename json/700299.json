Zwartjes did everything himself – camera, sound, editing and even the developing in the laboratory. He would work with non-professional actors selected from his circle of friends, and filmed in and around his own house. He particularly favoured editing his film ‘in the camera’ by switching the camera on and off while shooting. ‘My own motor system determined the film style,’ Zwartjes stated in an interview. ‘It never occurred to me to wonder: can this shot follow on after this one? If you start wondering about that you should be looking for another job straight away.’ This publication consists of a selection of photographs taken by Zwartjes during his years of filming and a short footage film on DVD from 1969.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dutch masters: Frans Zwartjes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
