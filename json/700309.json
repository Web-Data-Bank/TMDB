A young girl (Dree Hemmingway) sits alone in an office eating corn. Her hands are secured by Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) devices which both aid and hinder her ability to eat. As a symbolic nod to the disparity between identity and commodity, the individual and social constructs, the woman in the film’s interaction with the audience waivers between flirtation and apathy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Servitudes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
