George Daugherty brings this timeless tale to modern audiences by seamlessly weaving live-action with animation and music by the RCA Symphony Orchestra. The story opens as a grandfather (Lloyd Bridges) hosts his daughter (Kirstie Alley) and grandson (Ross Malinger from Sleepless in Seattle) during a visit to his country cottage. After lunch, the trio settles in as grandfather recounts \"The Story\" of Peter's adventures with a bird, cat, and dizzy duck on the outskirts \"of a very dark forest.\" The film morphs into a clever cartoon designed by the legendary Chuck Jones (of Wile E. Coyote fame). The \"story within a story\" leaps to life while the accompanying musical instruments also emerge as playful personalities.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/rLAId9EpqHevDXMohdsDLeaaahb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174679,"logo_path":null,"name":"IF/X Production","origin_country":""},{"id":96085,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chuck Jones Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":8180,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosgrove Hall Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter and the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":5.778,"vote_count":9}
