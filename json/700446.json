Sheltered under his air of a little fair-haired girl, the Belgian humorist, who caused a sensation by winning all the prizes of the humor festivals of the last two years, uncompromisingly tackles the most difficult themes: maternity, education, parenthood , abuse, homosexuality, racism, homophobia, and many others.  With Laura Laune, you will discover the monsters hiding in the closet!","popularity":1.467,"poster_path":"/bp5hb0RQIPi55qxvPuetU2veBdg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comedie +","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":91532,"logo_path":null,"name":"C8 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":114798,"logo_path":"/fRz8hntwXvSQmgffycK44kYhMlj.png","name":"CStar","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":133717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dark smile productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laura Laune - Le Diable est une gentille petite fille","video":false,"vote_average":8.25,"vote_count":4}
