A figure struck down by fate at the height of success, becoming at his death the symbol of that whole generation which is sometimes called the AIDS generation. However seen through the eyes and stories of those who were in close touch with him, what is revealed is the wide range of desires of Collard. The inexhaustible energy of the man who knew he was condemned eight years before he died and who fought to the last. And also the other side of this hunger for life which sometimes made him an exasperating meddler sick with love, sick with loving too much, too briefly or too badly. The portrait of someone who dared show himself nakedly without sparing anyone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/au4S0L5jRwZkkmSa0N132dPmDLa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chien-Loup - Histoires de Cyril Collard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
