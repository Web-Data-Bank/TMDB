I had transcribed the lyrics and noted the timings and had then made a detailed shot-list. The whole thing would be edited in camera on a single roll of Super 8. Over the next few years I projected the film so many times that much of it became damaged. Here is what is left of that first roll, inter-cut with footage shot a few years ago in East London when I started shooting film again.\" - Mark Jenkin","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wY7AlJzb5Nn2eXF9ZLt5lW8BC3q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
