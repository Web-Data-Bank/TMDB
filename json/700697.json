It is the story of Namarali, as presented by Sam Woolagoodja to his son Stanley and his granddaughter Kerry. Namarali is the law-giving 'Wandjina' of the Worora people who, along with him, have many other such Wandjinas. The 'Wandjinas' are ancient creators whose presence is real in the painted imprints of cave walls and in the shape of specific land formations. The film shows the importance of the Dreamtime in the Aboriginal culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gKVMkCtQ6LFs6bLw0GNc2UU7UC2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Radio and Television Board of the Australia Council","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lalai Dreamtime","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
