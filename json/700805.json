The promoters would hire the people I worked for to send me over to their party to take photos of the people there. I would go to 2-3 different clubs a night, 4 nights a week. The range in partygoers was pretty big. During my final few months with the company, I was mainly assigned to an after-party spot on Broadway called Pangaea. At Pangaea, I photographed Ice T, Sting, among others. The job, for the most part, was really fun. I drank so much Red Bull vodka.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/73EcZL182VbTi2YdKikhgZJoU2q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Club","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
