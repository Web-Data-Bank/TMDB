It's her agent on the other end of the line, calling to inform the struggling actress that she received an invitation to audition for a new mainstream project. The day of the audition, Amy looks a little confused. \"Do we have a script?\" she asks. The director smiles, with Tony, the male lead, chiming in. \"Stevie likes to freestyle his auditions,\" he adds. \"Starting off with how you look!\" Amy slowly turns around, trying to keep her composure. She feels awkward.  Emma is a Hollywood starlet that cares only about herself. She further proves this by causing a movie producer grief by being late for training with a stuntman. When she finds out that the stuntman she'll be closely working with is none other than Michael, her ex-boyfriend, her entitled attitude makes her even more difficult to work with.","popularity":0.638,"poster_path":"/9qr01gQLUf4yhBadS23Om12RmHH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Casting","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
