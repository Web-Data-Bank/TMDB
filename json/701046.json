From a photograph of his childhood, Luis Eduardo Aute glances back to discover what remains in him of those eyes of a child with which he looked at the sea. With the battle of Manila as the setting, a bloody contest that claimed the lives of more than a hundred thousand people, the author remembers the boy who was and how, from that tragic experience, the figure of the basilisk began to stalk him, a being mythological in the form of a winged serpent capable of killing with its eyes, representing the adult world, degradation and death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1k1sLpxyLUtWzZQWPWb89x7e9bH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El niño y el Basilisco","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
