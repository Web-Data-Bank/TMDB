Together with the protagonists, we set off to find out: the sky fires, the beasts are destroyed, the alien animals are everywhere, and the people are uneasy. The imperial court announced to the world that those who can subdue strange beasts can be rewarded and awarded, and a mechanism for subjugating beasts has been set up within the imperial court, animal control departments, and hero lists have been widely distributed.
