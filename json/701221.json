They are slow, the images. But then again we are traversing more than a hundred years. I am often teleporting the past to the present in what I make. And we are very suddenly in an inbetween. I welcome you to listen. To imagine with me a way to emerge and begin again and to view as you wish â€“ with intense looking, or restful witnessing. \"I think of the ground when I do this dance. And I think of my grandmas. And I think of yours.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p6mZUoz97E0iZwi1mBS7W3vXIXu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132155,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Onassis Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inbetween Kwimiak, blue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
