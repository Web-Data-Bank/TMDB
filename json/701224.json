Want to move better? Age better? Cope better with stress and the uncertainty of everyday life? How about start working on it while housebound? Linda and Jozef are introducing the basic principles of Fighting Monkey Practice. Life rarely happens as you expect. Most of the time it is unpredictable. What games do you play to grow young? There are no ‘exercises’ complex enough to prepare you for life. But open games–or movement situations as we call them–which involve partners, ever-changing rules, and are developed through the context in which we live, can. Instead of trying to ‘fix’ your body, try to learn joyfully and with long lasting benefits the importance of adaptability.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p6mZUoz97E0iZwi1mBS7W3vXIXu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132155,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Onassis Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled, part 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
