The film incorporates different artistic streams in allusion to padhant, thereby aiming at a profound aesthetic experience of rhythmic utterances in its multiple manifestations. Kalidasa's immortal Meghdootam serves a template for narrative development while creating a realm of different temporal designs fabricated by various rhythmic elements (percussion, dance) where padhant lies at the nucleus of contemplation and subsequent artistic expansion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sU1MItWEIsCp8zOiToFLglUHfVZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131397,"logo_path":null,"name":"PSBT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Sanskrit","iso_639_1":"sa","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vaikhari","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
