So Jola leaves Italy on a train bound for her native Poland. There, on the beach, she takes a trip down memory lane with her girlfriends: how she married the young man who got her pregnant, swore to care for him “in good times and in bad”, raised her six children and put up with punches, put-downs and her husband’s drinking problem. And now? Now she dresses elegantly, and takes singing and dance lessons. In the process, she meets a gentleman her age, Wojtek, and the two strike up a friendship. But divorce, at her age? What will her family, her friends or the church say? Of course, one can just leave, everyone is free to choose, but is it the right move?","popularity":0.605,"poster_path":"/eEWdSq00Ezo0PiBRyV1nl9z29kV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Widok Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2019-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lessons of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
