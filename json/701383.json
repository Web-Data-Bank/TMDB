Footage collected from disparate locations—a university herbarium, karst sinkholes inhabited by primordial flora and fauna, a telecommunication tower job site, a decaying grain silo, among others—interlocks to evoke a narrative of present danger and future disaster, of plant expansion and humanity's retreat. The film rejects the human individual as the focus of narrative cinema, and, instead, adopts the perspective of a symbiotic \"implosive whole\" in which human and nonhumans are related in an overlapping, non-total way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kyXUwnzcBaB5aIzinl8ucjDp644.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Field Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
