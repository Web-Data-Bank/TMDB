With tourism the town’s primary economy, myths of the Old South are not merely felt beneath the surface but make up the surface itself, and everyday interactions are inevitably imbued with the region’s fraught past. Stuck in the amber of a Confederate fantasy, locals eternally contend with questions of history and mythology, of industry and power. The characters of Natchez find joy, peace and melancholy amidst these specters in this vibrant portrait of life in the American South.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w6llYOETecqwfRk8V9V7L2KV6Bf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natchez","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
