The film begins with Makunaima, one of the founding myths of the native people from the border between Brazil-Venezuela-Guiana, first captured in the writings of the German ethnographer Koch-Grünberg at the beginning of the 1910s. With interviews in Portuguese, German, Spanish, and in the indigenous languages Macuxi and Taurepang, Searching for Macunaima reclaims this amazing character who represents Brazil in many ways (from literature to cinema to theatre) and remains relevant to date.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wsUTJV66vr1i2yhNbGNXBVQvRXV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Por onde anda Makunaíma?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
