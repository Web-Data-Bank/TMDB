She had participated like many others in the movement for independence in the 1920's and 30's but was forced by circumstances to withdraw from active participation. It is a film about the choices women are denied but who struggle to find other ways of expressing their resistance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t3LBZhYoB1xqw9fraKkRoHIqB99.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2016-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Quiet Little Entry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
