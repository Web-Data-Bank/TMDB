It aims to show the thin line between harmless faith and the kind that puts down human dignity in the name of religion. Starting with a Godman with questionable intent, it moves on to a place where women are segregated during their periods, a lady isn't allowed to enter her place of worship for being born into a specific caste, and finally to a dargah where mentally ill women are admitted for being cured of their demons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hOuYXDfE0SHcqkB0pWMm19cN8r2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OUR GODS ARE LIKE THAT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
