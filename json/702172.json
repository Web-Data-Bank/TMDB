In this absording tribute to Chauvire, filmmaker Dominique Delouche captures her detailed coaching sessions with stars of the Paris Opera Ballet. Classical perfection was the hallmark of Chauvire's dancing, with a strong emphasis on body and shoulder placement (EPAULEMENT), and this is everywhere evident in her work with her younger colleagues, elevating their performances both artistically and stylistically.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fKe8rUbiydcTJBA5Tx23TM865Mn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yvette Chauvire: France's Prima Ballerina Assoluta","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
