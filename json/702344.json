It makes complete sense that Cornelius, who has an almost obsessional devotion to the creation of programmatic electronic atmosphere, would find a place among them. The Japanese musician responsible for 1997’s remarkable Fantasma has ventured into video art before -- Five Point One, a companion piece to Point, combined hypnotic videos with a 5.1 surround mix of the album tracks in order. Which is basically what Sensurround does as well. As hinted above, this isn’t really a collection of music videos. They are too abstract, and too tightly interwoven with the album’s larger thematic concerns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l5GPoTuNx12BULhurM0WQqAC9vy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cornelius - Sensurround","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
