It was here that Mahler was born 150 years ago and here, in the breathtaking beauty, tranquility and idyll of the Bohemian countryside, is the starting point for Mahler's turn to fauna and flora. But the task was not only to find the perfect concert venue, but also top-class voice and sound conduits for the pieces of the witty conductor and composer.  World-famous soloists such as Thomas Hapson, Anne Sofie von Otter and Marita Solberg gathered on stage and, supported by the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, the Prague Philharmonic Choir and the Boni pueri Boys' Choir, celebrated Mahler's birthday at the very highest level. At the end, it was obvious to all of them that they had probably never been so close to the great master before and perhaps will never be so close again as on this evening.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2DQ4CqZXqfq8hYmd3wuG7nGSVC0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mahler Classical Symphony","title":"The Gustav Mahler Celebration","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
