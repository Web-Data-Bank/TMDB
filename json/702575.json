In a distant and near future, both fantastic and absurd, men and wo-men survive as they can. Following a man, a slender figure between Tati and Buster Keaton, we discover through scenes of his daily life how devastating the effects of climate change are on humans and nature.

A disturbing and hilarious ride in the future, that is already our present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dR1o41OOzNZLCaW5KlDD3UbITMm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2019-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sunny Day","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
