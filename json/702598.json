The cylinder, well explained by \"Agostino-Eduardo\" in the comedy, is a representation of power, designed to intimidate the ignorant for its only evocative \"power\". It can also be seen as a sort of \"Pirandellian mask\", where the character of Augustine wears it to defend himself and represent something that he is not.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/15DJr0Nb8JKtlRHRKZqFg4q9pf1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Cilindro","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
