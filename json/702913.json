Annoyed by her husband's lack of caring, her eyes linger on a birthday card from her sister. \"Family's important, isn't it?\". Unfortunately for HIM, karma's out to get him. The next day, the husband's world is turned upside down when a teen girl (Whitney Wright) shows up on his doorsteps. Family Vacation: Two teenage girls, Allie (Gia Paige) and Beth (Avi Love), are sharing a tearful goodbye. They'd been in the foster system together for years -- it's like they're sisters -- but now Beth is moving in with a different foster family.
