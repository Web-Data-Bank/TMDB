First performed in Paris in 1843, at the turning point of several eras, Don Pasquale, a composite and varied work, is the apotheosis of opera buffa. Performed for the first time at the Paris Opera, the production has been entrusted to the Italian director, Damiano Michieletto, who transports us directly to the sincerity and dramatic splendour at the heart of an apparently light‑hearted work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uOFinDnJil8B7JDkBjfv117ISQH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Pasquale - Palais Garnier","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
