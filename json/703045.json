Months after winning his gold medal, Rulon's toe was amputated from severe frostbite after a near-death wilderness stranding in sub-zero temperatures. Then with 9 toes - and after surviving a near-fatal motorcycle accident, Rulon won another medal at the next Olympics, only to survive a plane crash by swimming two miles in a freezing lake. Finally, after ballooning to 500 lbs., Rulon won America's heart competing on a season of The Biggest Loser only to lose his life savings and retreat into obscurity after getting swindled in a real estate deal that cost him his Olympic medals.","popularity":1.108,"poster_path":"/bmU4DuFbrkYhSgHxxZgZe8B3PPf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52242,"logo_path":"/fZK0w7ghcoqMlLa28LNCoZLCnj5.png","name":"Mandalay Sports Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rulon Gardner Won't Die","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2}
