Doesn't she realize this will change everything? Probably not. Spending hours on the phone with the sperm bank doesn't leave a lot of time to think about family matters. A humorous drama dealing with the current debate on the very real issue of gay and lesbian couples starting families, IVF programs and the evolving community attitudes towards these changes. A buoyant and entertaining journey through dial-up sperm banks, relationships and baby clothes.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/2bzRjjXGrrnaar3k0v4rXcPi4QL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Girls and a Baby","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":3}
