Bringing together dance, acrobatics, live video, filmed sequences and animation, the show takes spectators on a fantastic voyage through the history of cinema and its genres, taking them into the heart of the movie-making process. From illustration to animation, black andâ€‰white to colour, silent films to talkies, fixed shots to swooping camera movements, spectators witness the poetic construction/deconstruction of this art as an object and as a way of transcending reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hjYFVG6oxTpPeLEpR4A8Bd6tfuW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cirque du Soleil Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey through the World of Cinema","title":"Cirque du Soleil: IRIS","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
