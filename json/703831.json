But he has stunned both guards and inmates alike, by accepting Christ in a prison bible study. Upon his release, he's anxious to share his new faith with the outside world. However, looking more like a thug than a theologian, the outside world is terrified of him. His only allies are his meek and mild Christian mentor, Matt Garrett and his no nonsense parole officer.","popularity":0.695,"poster_path":"/maRMgcWIMsEhzqTq4y5OfhVPexB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112350,"logo_path":null,"name":"JC Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Light","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
