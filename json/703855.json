He cites one famous line from Cantonese opera 'Princess Chang Ping', 'I deny, I deny, but in the end I cannot deny' as a metaphor for Hong Kongers' troubled minds when they have to recognize their identity as Chinese. To make a statement of the theme, Kwan adopts a complicated structure, mixing excerpts from his previous films, his stage play, even the soundtrack of Wong Kar-wai's Days of Being Wild.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nl8Is6S5eVzzeNyEE7FfnNECKVb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taiwan Film Center","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1997-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Love You After All These","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
