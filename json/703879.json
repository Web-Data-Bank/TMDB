As a ‘soft-digital’ environment made active and populated by viewing collaborators, Starling advocates for artistic co-production, drifting from obsessive individualism to a more modest and symbiotic perception of nature and culture alike.  Given the ecologically compromised world we find ourselves in, can we learn to regard other, more open, systems of knowledge and being that strip humancentric perceptions of the world? E.g. How far can the computer determine or engineer biological design? How to shape our continuous study of ‘being here’ by being inclusive and taking in matter, forms, and energies from our greater environment – its objects and beings – to stimulate a more dynamic cycle of interactions and co-partnership with nonhuman others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qXUcFIq81XkHWbi9V7SF9DUWvND.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
