As they tracked their master's killers they happened across a Christian crusading army returning home to France and England after suffering defeat and exile from Jerusalem. King Philip had found the samurai's code of ethics so compelling that he retained their services in hopes of retraining his own army's thinking. The samurai had found a new master in King Philip and soon began teaching the way of the sword to the King's finest Knights, who over the years had been given the name Samurai Knights.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bQPWS2Zg2MEhjjjq08KDVWqISwo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nicholas Steele Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samurai Knights","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
