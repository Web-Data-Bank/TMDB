What if it rains? What if his sweater doesnâ€™t match the shirt he is wearing? It's probably better to stay in the safety of his own home and switch on the television. In the total isolation of his solitary life, and out of an entirely unfounded fear of stepping outside his flat, Claes has turned his tidy home into a prison. This is a film that demonstrates what loneliness can do to a person.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A57aP0m5ZglRRXy12y8uq3Qb9rt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2011-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
