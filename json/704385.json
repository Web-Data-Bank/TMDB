Bild means “image” in German, and the crux of this project was to create a “virtual quilt” of original short films from Lori that are set to new peices of music that she commissioned from a variety of underground artists including Cotton Museum, Carlos Giffoni, Bradley Heiple, Intro to Pterodactyl, Leslie Keffer, Dave Kuzy, Jim Lingo, Mesaplex, Irene Moon, Jeffrey Schreckengost, Mike Shiftlet, Adam Strohm, Torus, Weasel Walter, C. Spencer Yeh, and Scott Young, with the only stipulation being that each piece of music need be exactly two minutes in length.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aJjLZ0QpzYz8iyckAWu2ZV0n9fk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bild Quilt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
