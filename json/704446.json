Entrop is based on a virtual three dimensional version of such a zoetrope, using digital means to go beyond the traditional physical relation of energy and movement. The work explores the tension between various forces and spatial perception in sound and moving image: energy is being fed into a system, resulting in movement and centrifugal forces. During this build up of energy and speed the system becomes unstable and new accidental possibilities of sensory perception present themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tLv1bT5WDqnwHUKPlOph9Efpkjd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entrop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
