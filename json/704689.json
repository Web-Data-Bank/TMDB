Images, support for a trip lived alone, worry sliding on the screen, they write their own memory. A document that talks about a place, a memory, a feeling. Space is captured when it is disappearing to become an image. Signs, looks, actions, decompose to slide on the screen. The territory becomes an excuse to talk about yourself, to tell the story of our life. Time, images, sounds, rhythm become an abstract and documentary conception of movement and gaze.” - M.
