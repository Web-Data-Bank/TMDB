When he called her that evening to see how she was doing, she immediately turned the question on him. “Holding a lot back,” he said “I’m doing okay. It’s just been a hard day,” to which his grandmother replied “A hard day because of school or a hard day because Bob died?” The film explores the loss of love and its impact on how descendants of that first couple experience it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/88EkAVBEAQ7SVbDNNvAH4qRmtha.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Holiday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
