The structural concerns of Grace were pursuing questions of fractured, invisible time and representations of form and motion. The deeper and more personal subject pursued issues of flesh, mortality, and sexuality. Visual inspirations included artists such as photographers Julia Margaret Cameron, Joel Peter Witkin, and artist Joseph Beuys. I worked with an actress, optical printing, projection, under-the-camera, and stop-motion animation.\"-Lorelei Pepi","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9IXNNL3Jd4UErbkdnZXNvKsChIq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grace","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
