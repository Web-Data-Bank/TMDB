A woman walks a fine line between sanity and madness in a world of constant twilight. She works at a filling station and lives a life of emotional isolation. No one seems to pay attention to her, and she lives in a run-down flat that looks as if it's decaying before our eyes. As the woman wrestles with the demons that are taking hold within her mind, she frequently confronts herself in the mirror, often while naked.","popularity":1.018,"poster_path":"/pI3012TLiv8yh3iC7vlNYybGnJc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34602,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Productie","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":54833,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moskito Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2009-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crepuscule","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
