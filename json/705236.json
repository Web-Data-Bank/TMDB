It took place on September 22, 1927, at Soldier Field in Chicago. \"Long Count\" is applied to the fight because when Tunney was knocked down in the seventh round the count was delayed due to Dempsey's failure to go to and remain in a neutral corner. Whether this \"long count\" actually affected the outcome remains a subject of debate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gene Tunney Vs Jack Dempsey II","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
