The metaphoric voice of the skin provides a counterpoint as four women talk about how AIDS has disrupted their lives. Brenda and Hedde courageously address the isolation and stigma of their personal lives when they go public as People Living With AIDS (PLWAs). Ann and Lucille confront (through each other), the complex social, cultural and medical agendas surrounding women and AIDS. In Skin, women speak powerfully and urgently of their experience with AIDS, their voices breaking through the silence of neglect created by the media.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q07tx7VL3cjL1qAUo3ldi75JVZQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
