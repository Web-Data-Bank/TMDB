Some say the results of the restoration are glorious. Others have called them tragic.  Da Vinci’s famously fragile fresco was always going to be a challenge for its secretive Italian restorers. No one, however, could have foreseen how problematic and strange their task would become. Marked by a series of extraordinary mishaps, mistakes, and miscalculations, the incredible restoration is hilarious to watch but may have resulted in the loss of a masterpiece.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6h5tdUclvYQoXdYlw4Tn2VnKRWE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Supper","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
