The case was one of the first that shined a spotlight on what many called the \"legal lynchings\" that occurred in the South whenever blacks were accused of crimes, especially against whites and most especially against white women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/exQOXVvbzbtqDnAcTlEr45lFFK7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scottsboro: An American Tragedy","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4}
