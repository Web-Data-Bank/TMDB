Introduced by Dr Sarah Humphrey and unfolding like a video version of Cosmopolitan the five “chapters” cover “What Women Want From … Life, Their Bodies, Sex, Their Lover and Their Relationship”. Vox pops from a variety of women preface sex sequences with different couples which cover safe sex, masturbation and becoming orgasmic, oral sex (receiving and giving) and the advantages of various positions for intercourse. 3-D computer models show what happens inside a woman’s body during sex and there is enough information to give a better understanding of female sexuality to both women and men.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/80t3MQ0YWGNudLagEqBlyzRNfi8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lovers' Guide: What Women Really Want","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
