Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan, was previously called Ainumosir, or land of the Ainu. Ainu traditions are facing a critical situation; the latest survey revealed that the Ainu population is less than 20,000 people in Hokkaido, and UNESCO has recognized the language as ‘critically endangered.’  This documentary was filmed in Biratori town in Hokkaido, where many people with Ainu roots still live. It is also known as the hometown of the late Shigeru Kayano, who contributed greatly to the field of research on Ainu culture.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/ujahQQUhv9naToNFTHcIBESUW6q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ainu: Indigenous People of Japan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
