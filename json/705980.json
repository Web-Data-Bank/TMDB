It’s not just hot weather, hot flushes, her daughters’ materialism, her mother’s dementia, her husband’s drinking, or the impending gentrification of the food market where she sells fish – although all of that will push her to take a stand. After trying to cover it up, O-bok reveals to her daughter that she was raped by a fellow stallholder, the man organising the traders against their landlords. Increasingly furious, O-bok eschews the useless police to pursue her own justice, even if it means a physical fight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5lld8hk0hQ6GRnhm4C7H5iFIJcC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116869,"logo_path":null,"name":"DGC","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":112449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jinjin Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gull","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
