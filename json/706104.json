Though they are icons of the Southwest, rattlers are often persecuted as venomous villains. A handful of states still hold annual roundups to collect and kill as many snakes as possible. But the serpents do have an ally: rattlesnake rescuer Jules Sylvester, who has made it his mission to save as many as he can. Join him on a road trip through the Wild West as he busts myths and rescues a few rattlers along the way.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/rXEVKUicRlrTEmxs2bTaKCaHhzx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18894,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smithsonian Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rattlesnake Road Trip","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
