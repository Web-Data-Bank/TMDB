A magnificent cast of singers, predominantly Francophone, assembled under the baton of John Nelson, an acknowledged master of Berlioz’s music who has conducted Les Troyens more frequently than anyone else over a period of more than 40 years; he made his name with the piece when he led performances at New York’s Metropolitan Opera in 1974 and enjoyed great acclaim for a production at the Frankfurt Opera shortly before the Strasbourg concerts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rIerNtXFLEkUDLGPhGD09NldDZz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlioz: Les Troyens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
