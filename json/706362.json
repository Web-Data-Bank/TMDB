Radical architects, video pioneers, and mordantly funny cultural commentators, the Ant Farmers created a body of deeply subversive multidisciplinary work that questioned the boundaries of architecture and everything else in the process. Incorporating breathtaking archival video, new footage shot over ten years and animation based on zany period sketches, this film is about the joy of creation in a time when there were no limits.  â€”Beth Federici","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aY6FhX2jZGCdypyUZjwlPkjWdks.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Space, Land and Time: Underground Adventures with Ant Farm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
