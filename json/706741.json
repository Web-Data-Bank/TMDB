The Danish band found a fitting name for their opulent stage set and huge production: amplified history. Their viewers use other words such as \"amazing, mind-blowing, goose bumps, unforgettable\". As a tribute to the overwhelming demand of their fast- growing host of supporters, HEILUNG released a complete live show under the banner of 'LIFA', which was filmed at Castlefest 2017.","popularity":0.742,"poster_path":"/2BGmGV7DssCtjZGwVOo1cdvGQMo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heilung: Lifa - Live at Castlefest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
