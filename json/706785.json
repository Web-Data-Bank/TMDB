A new musical set simultaneously in the 1940s and in the present day, Pieces Of String tells how Jane’s father, Edward, came back from the Second World War with a secret that would change his life forever – a secret that he would carry until the day he died.  With hauntingly beautiful music and a heart-rending human story, Pieces Of String is a tender, funny, emotionally-charged exploration of how three generations of one family learn to deal with a story that nobody’s been brave enough to tell until today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/isjG9EtQkKXdpCnVF2iKPON5Aox.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pieces of String","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
