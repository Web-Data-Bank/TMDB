Returning home from work, she makes a phone call that goes to voicemail; nearing her residence, another phone call comes in, but she doesn't pick up. Inside the house is her mother's body—she died from mysterious circumstances. A knock on the door goes unanswered, but when a plainclothes police officer arrives, Hae-su lets him in. An exchange of documents, uncertain glances. With Hae-su and her tempermental brother the only attendants at her mother's funeral, there are more questions than answers.","popularity":0.912,"poster_path":"/4SOf1GyRxi25lOJUuxfzksy6DcS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135751,"logo_path":null,"name":"GoAndGo Film","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dust and Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
