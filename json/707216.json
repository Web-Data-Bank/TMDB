A film about the beauty of archeology and excavation, conveyed through the post-mortem portrait of archeologist Yannis Sakellarakis. A journey in search of a man who is no longer present, through the traces he left in the places he visited and the people he met. A cinematic excavation that brings to light an image through fragments and traces, just like archeology does.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p0cV7t7MMChqn4PdfuQgCOs4zpK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Portolanos Films","origin_country":""},{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/x5m947rMvwJbNpoGil5W76dIJjB.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trace of Time","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
