There is an equally apparent variable. So your question - to phrase it poorly - might be, what is it that is being measured here? The materials of this film are personal, comfortably so. Nothing in that way distorted or untoward. But the choices of the artist are both crucial and defining, and there is evident attention to what he has called boundaries. This ... is a beautiful film, factually, with a lovely shifting counterpoint in the pacing. Like an old slow blues, after some up-tempo number – so, read it and think.\" – Robert Creeley","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AsanVLZSGp3W3b98gU1gT5hzbWX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Domicile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
