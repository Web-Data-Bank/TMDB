Saw it recently ... and was very impressed and interested - made me want to see it a few more times. ... But your film, even though I see it operating through composition (pictorial plus time-based) did get me on the edge of my seat - the image quality throughout was really rather extraordinary. In addition, the film just seemed somehow more serious, which is I guess a matter of a kind of depth and subtlety. So anyhow, you kind of won me over to where my prejudices just melted away.\" - Fred Worden","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fur of this Animal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
