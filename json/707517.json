Some of these enthusiasts filmed their campaigns and their home movies tell the story of how, in the teeth of much political opposition, they saved the inland waterways for the nation and, more than 200 years after they were first built, created a second golden age of the canals.  There is astonishing film of the last days of working boats, some shot by John Pyper when he spent time with the Beecheys in the 60s, film taken by Keith Christie of the last days of the cut around the BCN, and the films made by Keith and his mate Tony Gregory of their attempts to keep working the canals through their carrying company, Midland Canal Transport.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qNGRmnLNAhGSx5ba3LvdjWSEptX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary featuring home movies of the diehard enthusiasts and boat owners who helped to save the inland waterways for the nation and create a second golden age of the canals.","title":"The Golden Age of Canals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
