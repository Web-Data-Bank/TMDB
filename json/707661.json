With many trapped in the company’s vessels in Drapetsona, a part of the Piraeus port, and away from the spotlight, the camera captures their efforts to receive their wages for 7 months during the most critical times in Greece’s modern history. To this day they have received less than half of the wages owed to them and their case is still before the court of appeal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dE9zn9HFLJ6tUgKpFcKxn4mkumB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134364,"logo_path":null,"name":"Athenslive","origin_country":""},{"id":132634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung","origin_country":""},{"id":134365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fosphotos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tied","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
