The film takes us through a critical year in the life of Georgia's young democracy- from the presidential election of January 2008 to the chaos of the war with Russia and the sobering aftermath - and raises questions about political responsibility and the morality of international affairs. The story is told through its main actors: the Georgian president, the Georgian government, the political opposition, foreign leaders, international delegations and organisations and the ordinary Georgian people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2009-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something About Georgia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
