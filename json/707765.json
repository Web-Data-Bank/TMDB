To make matters even more atmospheric, our story is set in a picturesque harbor town. Yoshida is Tetsu's double-crossing rival who pays in the end with his life. Fairly superficial, but the tone isn't particularly light; in fact, it is downright melancholic, which is the picture's salvation. The emphasis on Tetsu never being able to escape his criminal life despite his tender side, the downbeat undercurrent of cynical gang activity amidst the sunset-dappled waves, actually makes this an entertaining sequel. However, Suzuki's irreverent surrealism is replaced by Morinaga's Monet-like impressionism.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/m6QubqSefUIfK8RwicUUHZ2spYx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":955,"logo_path":"/5xnXD3PJI1HqOJceSAKZ3fDqO1V.png","name":"Nikkatsu Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1966-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Drifter 2: The Sea Is Bright Red as the Color of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
