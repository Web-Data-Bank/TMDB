Nassia recalls and reminisces how she left her husband in Moldavia, a man who used to drink and hit her and then ask her “why are you trembling? I haven’t begun hitting you yet.” Nassia leaves Moldavia to save herself. When it doesn’t drive you wild, poverty and violence can transform you into an angel. A life’s worth nothing; and nothing’s worth as much as a single life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/exfX0b1QDU7qlNZL6WGFJHZq2K4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic in People: Broken Greek","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
