Nearly 60 years later, Americans-young and old alike-still want to serve their country and understand their place in the world; current volunteers work at the forefront of some of the most pressing issues facing the global community – yet the agency has struggled to remain relevant amid sociopolitical change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gJyuWBql4nDt8tA5d3UQaAH45Ak.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Towering Task: The Story of the Peace Corps","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
