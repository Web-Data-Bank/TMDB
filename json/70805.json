Madeleine the most unsettling creature of that name since \"Vertigo\" is a middle-aged, moderately successful actress. Oliver/Matthew is either a homeless man or a famous film director or both. Madeleine hails him on the street as the latter, launching a bizarre chain of events that includes a conversation in a diner, a very unromantic sexual encounter, the arrival of Madeleine's odd husband and unsuspecting daughter, and a child's birthday party. The film also compassionately tracks the daily rounds of Oliver/Matthew's fellow denizens of the homeless shelter, some of whom will be recognizable to New York audiences.","popularity":0.911,"poster_path":"/gaPfSih6I5iYNoC6ZA0Hlyl6tJo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40423,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunday Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":40424,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goatworks Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":40425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ocelot Films Inc.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-05-01","revenue":288,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7}
