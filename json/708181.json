In America our trio, armed with the hottest new supercars - the Mercedes SLS, Ferrari 458 and the Porsche 911 GT3RS - head through NASCAR country and enjoy a dancing Mayor, a Stig on a drive by shooting range, and the white knuckle Virginia Raceway, with their adventure climaxing in a race across New York.  But that's nothing compared to Albania, where they are summoned by a Mafia Boss to pick a winner from the new Rolls-Royce Ghost, The Mercedes S-Class, and the new Bentley Mulsanne (sort of). Keen to please, the boys embark on their most comprehensive test ever, including the Dead Fat Man in the Boot challenge, and a bank robbery to find the best getaway car. Will James be killed in the resulting car chase? The answer is yes. Definitely.","popularity":1.161,"poster_path":"/nfHUsM8tsGqyVUnSwXsFdzyRRK3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Top Gear: The U.S. & Albania Road Trips (The Directors’ Cuts)","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
