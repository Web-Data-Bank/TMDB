The voice-over becomes the common thread of a fantastic surreal story about strange events that occurred in an abandoned house. The action highlighted with the unique presence of insects, shadows, reflections and rain, proposes scenarios for the specific spaces in the story and invites you to recreate the characters and events narrated there.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/35G7XOvIAuQY8mRwGA27Pu4Hokv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La casa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
