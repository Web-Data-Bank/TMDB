For Patricio this does not seem to be a problem; it is shown as a person willing to a fickle love. But Marco plays the role of the neurotic: he does not feel a taste in this triad, he chases the girl, questions his friend, bothers the relationship and shows his disagreement. This could go through a triangle to use, one more in the history of cinema. But sometimes the geometry breaks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iBIBW20ZjGVy7FtzZTjwmwkhRLE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El amor cambia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
