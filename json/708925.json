Blazing their way through hit after hit, the bulk of which are taken from 2007's Because of the Times, the band's onstage banter grows more sincere as they're seduced by the audience's enthusiasm.  Even the singing along is at an optimum, which is admirable considering the indecipherability of Caleb's vocals. By the time they take the briefest of pauses before an encore of the eagerly awaited and lovingly delivered Knocked Up, it's clear that Kings of Leon have conceded to the inevitable. No band is bigger than the crowd. And this crowd sure loves them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jSCxkGVO7XbI9Ysf0cGABB6HhbV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kings of Leon: Live at Glastonbury 2008","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
