The band, born in Bristol and close to the Glastonbury location itself, were more emotionally charged than usual at the gravitas of the moment, a performance for them that marked their true arrival on the alternative music scene.  Taking to the stage, lead singer Joe Talbot, said: “This it’s one of the most magnificent moments of our lives,” with the type honesty that made the crowd feel even more included with this unique band. “We’ve waited 12 years to play here. This is the best place on earth. I’ve stood where you are and cried to Thom Yorke, Battles, The Horrors,” he added.  IDLES are already an incredibly inclusive band, their lyrics attempt to shed positive light on serious topics that are often the subjects of negative press.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iCPyUYsf2w4FelGMflEtyfdo6Xm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IDLES: Live at Glastonbury 2019","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
