Cast in an abandoned Venice – a derelict film set in Luxembourg, as it turns out – this short fiction relates a meeting of a curator, a theorist, a painter and a “relational” artist who appear to engage in complex theoretical debates. Their verbal confrontation – a grotesque patchwork of quotes that mocks the art world’s infatuation with sampling and referencing – is punctuated by a string of dreamlike sequences in which the stereotypical characters are seen killing each other in the best tradition of mondo films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jjiS6bDWbUEfv5WzQD7yd5Af87f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mondo Veneziano","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
