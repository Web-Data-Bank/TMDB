Sitting in the back of a taxi, you gradually piece together your story, abstracted and dreamlike, as you progress into the quiet shock of a new world. Your taxi driver, himself a migrant to Australia, navigates the new terrain with you, and acts as your guide while revealing small glimpses of his own story. This 360-degree, stop-motion VR film recreates and investigates the geographic and visual dislocation of arriving somewhere unfamiliar: the beginnings of finding a new home in a foreign land.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aILwx5CJz8OTOKGyy8FgajyyZY8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98157,"logo_path":"/fLczneIGOqD0rbbN3oAw74Abh97.png","name":"Film Camp","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passenger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
