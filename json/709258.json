On most Saturday mornings, its one of the best places on earth, full of hungry people, crunchy fruits, snappy vegetables, world-class street food, cool characters and tasty surprises of all sorts. This 1996 documentary is a tour of the Strip including big breakfasts, shopping along Penn Avenue and Smallman Street, warehouses, churches and nightclubs, along with some amazing history. Producer Rick Sebak says, \"It ends up being a big commercial for the Strip, but the neighborhood deserves lots of loving attention. Its a great, great place.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5EPOjTp1HfIJaE99PjyY6zo6Rku.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strip Show","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
