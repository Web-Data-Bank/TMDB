Asamura is strong in fighting but not in making money, and together with his brother Matsuo, he forcibly takes on the business of the rival Nishinaga clan. The Nishinaga clan tries to take Asamura's sister, Yuna, a singer, hostage, but Asamura retaliates against them and kills many members of the clan.
