He went from being an underground Wu-Tang Clan affiliated rapper to a humorous, worldwide tabloid sensation overnight: the wacky story of the rapper who cut his own penis off and jumped from a two-story balcony.  Harassed by the media while recovering in hospital, his suffering was overlooked until months later, when it emerged that Andre had been under the influence of PCP among other drugs, and had been suffering from severe depression.  The act was in fact a reaction to the downward spiral of dark and destructive thoughts he was experiencing as a result of a far from perfect family life This documentary hears from a number of Andreâ€™s friends, colleagues and family members, offering a first-hand look at how difficult mental health issues can be to address in such a macho industry as Hip Hop.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":134673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clockwise Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rapper Who Chopped His Penis Off","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
