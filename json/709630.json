Liu shoots a group of female artists, including Yunnan dancer Wen Hui, Xinjiang painter Yang Keqin, artist-curator Liao Wen, and others. The \"Cobra\" in the film's title references the name of a women's rock band at the time. \"The climax of the film finds 12 female artists organizing their own joint art exhibition...a female public space is formed among them, bringing them together.\" -- Zhang Zhen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lN0fI86ChbDeYrYoIJATlWKlTY4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for Cobra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
