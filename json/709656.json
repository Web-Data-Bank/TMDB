I know that the Paya in the film was at a lecture about left-behind children at Pudao Caotang Bookstore in Nanluogu Lane, Beijing. The small hall of the bookstore is full of people. I can only squeeze in a corner where I cannot see the presenter and the screen. After listening to the lecture and Q & A for nearly two hours. The presenter, Dr. Zhao Junchao, is an associate researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council. He conducted a survey in Duan, Guangxi for five years and published the book \"A Survey of Left-behind Children in China.\" I was originally interested in \"left-behind children\", but in his story, an old lady attracted me: she lost six of her seven sons, and she supported the orphans left by the six or seven sons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
