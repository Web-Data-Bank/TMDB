From the shores of Africa to the Americas, ¡Salud! hits the road with some of the 28,000 Cuban health professionals serving in 68 countries, and explores the hearts and minds of international medical students in Cuba -- now numbering 30,000, including nearly 100 from the USA. Their stories plus testimony from experts around the world bring home the competing agendas that mark the battle for global health-and the complex realities confronting the movement to make health care everyone's birth right.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1Ii0YmxGXEeiA8BTzz3X11qoUkw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46631,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Paradigm Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"2006-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"¡Salud!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
