It features supposed experts on sexuality being interviewed by a television talk show anchorwoman. These “experts” espouse the many, often ill-informed, theories presented to explain homosexuality. Intercut with the drama are actual recordings of a radio talkback therapist and documentary interviews with lesbians. In a bright and savvy way, WAR ON LESBIANS reveals how far many of the myths about lesbians are from truth. WAR ON LESBIANS is the perfect post-script to Jane Cottis’s hilarious feature film DRY KISSES ONLY.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War on Lesbians","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
