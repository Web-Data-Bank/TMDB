This second show starts exactly where the first show ended: in the same theatrical scenery, with the same robot. But this time Wertheim surprises his audience by showing up. He tells about how the first experimental comedy show was received and contemplates about the magic of theatre and art in a society about the right to exist of art in a society that allows less and less doubt and confusion. When Robot falls into a depression, the boundaries between theater and reality begin to blur.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pb7uIT3CYpCql0aIv6k9wU0uW6N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bunker Theaterzaken","origin_country":""},{"id":100462,"logo_path":"/24dhPKt8sDtfWfNs1rsVtskOwZZ.png","name":"BNNVARA","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Micha Wertheim: Someone Else","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
