He works hard to maintain the status of the best stage hypnotist in Poland, for which he has to pay a high price. During his tours around Poland, when he stages his hypnoshow, Jurij earns big money. But at the same time, treated more as a circus attraction than a professional therapist, he feels that he is loosing his energy and talent. Torn between the moral dilemma and economic profit, Jurij becomes more and more frustrated. When he wipes away his stage makeup and returns to his family home in Ukraine, he becomes a loving son, trying to reconcile with his old father.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tfYTp3UPB376byrb2OZLtxBIOPC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109147,"logo_path":"/fmdKelaoaLILbNpXAq2T4JDWG1S.png","name":"Telemark","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2016-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gift","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
