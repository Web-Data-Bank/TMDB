Not only did they now dance to music written exclusively for them – they had done it before early on in the hits Maria, Maria and Último Trem (both soundtracks by Milton Nascimento and Fernando Brant), but they also established that this was to become a house rule. It allowed Rodrigo Pederneiras to start building an extensive choreographic vocabulary with markedly Brazilianist inflexions that would become one of the company’s trademarks. A web of combinations of rhytmns and tonalities around the number 21 were written on geometric scores specially created by Marco Antônio Guimarães – the artistic director of Uakti Instrumental Workshop and designer of the unconventional instruments that give them their unique sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"21","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
