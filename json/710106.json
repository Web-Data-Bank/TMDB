Striking from the stage, without any shame, any trace of the classical technique - which, however, is present in the formation of the dancers, supports the complex choreography - the choreographer evokes, from beginning to end, Afro-Brazilian rhythms such as maracatu, candomblé and congado. Anarchy and frenzy replace the symmetry and order of the dancers on stage. Pas-deux and fouettés give way to standing beats, hips, shoulders and pelvis. The rhythmic diversity comes alive to the sound of the inspired music of composer, singer and guitarist João Bosco. There are eleven themes - specially created as the Benguelê theme music, or recreated as the chorinho 1x0 by Pixinguinha, or Tarantá and Carreiro Bebe, from folklore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benguelê","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
