In order to stimulate the creation of the soundtrack for Grupo Corpo’s ballet, Lenine himself placed Damocles’ sword above his own head by constructing a musical topography interlaced with rhythmical subversions (a passion) from a single leitmotif and using only strings. In a work where the occupation of space reflects the diabolical intermittence and guile worked on time by Lenine’s music, the possibility of creating a series of female duos acted as a soothing moment and a pause for breath.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
