Against the backdrop of a changing world, and channeled through the bodies of eight young dancers, Franco and De Keersmaeker offer an updated version of their own earlier work. As a part of their strategy they invited the young choreographer and dancer Louis Nam Le Van Ho to confront his own writing with De Keersmaeker’s choreography; his contribution builds a bridge to a new generation of creators and choreographers, providing a different perspective on De Keersmaeker’s and Franco’s ongoing examination of the essence of dance and composition. Franco joins Rosas’s dancers on stage, performing the piece live on the piano. In a broad historical gesture, the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, Johannes Brahms, Arnold Schönberg, and Anton Webern stretches across the geometric principles and improvised sections of the choreography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zeitigung","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
