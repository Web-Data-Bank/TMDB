For me, the camera was a pretext for an in-depth apprenticeship.  The finished film recapitulates my process of learning, gleaned over time, as I observed Johns and the printers at work. What I wanted to know was how one generates a work of art and, for that matter, what is art, what work is involved, and how do ideas as opposed to physical labor drive the decision making process.  The films became a meditation on art and craft, as well as on the dialectic of mind and body, concept and actual work.\" -Katy Martin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kZiHSVxXsZa8elJJAIvg9ckkACO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hanafuda / Jasper Johns","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
