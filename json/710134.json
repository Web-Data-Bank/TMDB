The sun. The sand. The salt-water taffy. In this slightly wacky documentary, we consider all kinds of things that draw people to the coast: board walks, seafood, lifeguards, even metal-detectors and roller skates. From Nantucket to Venice Beach, people relax and bounce in the waves. From the Outer Banks to Oahu, beachgoers bring along their fishing gear and hope to catch some dinner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fzQb00cvp6sWjmXRlfr8FFckpDW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some of the quirky joys of going to the beach.","title":"Shore Things","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
