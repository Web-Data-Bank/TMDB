Director Noel M. Izon captures their stories through the voices of the veterans themselves – only half of whom are still alive today – and delivers touching personal accounts of the men’s contributions and sacrifices during the war. Despite the fact that they endured a bleak, racist prewar climate and were not even considered U.S. citizens, these individuals rallied to join the war effort and cement their rightful place in American history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Untold Triumph: America's Filipino Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
