But Thibaut had a very precise idea : one day, he will become a musher. Except that Thibaut grew up in the North of France, in a family which hate dogs, and he never left his native region. Today, he's 41 years old, and he's giving himself a challenge: be part of the biggest european trainee dogs running, in the north of the Polar Circle. This means that he will have to leave his family for three months and fight the \"Great White Silence\" loneliness and dangerousness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/llgmTeEDVP14zugSZFrvJkah1SK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142089,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Horses Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Call of the North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
