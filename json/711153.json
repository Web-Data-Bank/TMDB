From tedious day jobs and mixed family reactions to grueling, late night, in-ring sessions that occasionally impart more bumps and bruises than skill, the women who opt to pursue a life in wrestling willingly leave all convention behind. Following a muse that's outside the norm, and willing to sacrifice anything for entry into a world that's more carny than commonplace, these new ladies of wrestling prove that, in a world of ever-increasing predictable mundanity, the human spirit is alive and well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bM3FXDwbbky7b31XDQLXQLhOV52.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97253,"logo_path":null,"name":"WOWNow Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An unfiltered look at the reality of the world of women's professional wrestling","title":"Go Big Or Go Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
