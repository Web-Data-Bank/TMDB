They are hidden inside the film archive of New Taipei City’s “Singapore Industrial Park”, where the 17,000-plus film reels and over a million film artifacts have become their spiritual nourishment. Day after day, they shuttle back and forth inside, carrying their doubts, their learnings, and their faith. What they are doing is awakening these long-neglected film reels, then piecing together the no-longer-existent social atmospheres and lives of distant pasts recorded on them. And spending time in this archive has become everyday life for these film archivists and restorers.","popularity":0.603,"poster_path":"/7cRSXbTgXOj9gLP9sidkCg4vf0N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140619,"logo_path":null,"name":"7th Day Film","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Archiving Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
