Rarely do Japanese employees stand up against exploitative working conditions, since the social pressure is too high. In his documentary, Tokachi TSUCHIYA follows the case of a moving company sales agent who decides to no longer accept illegal employment contract clauses and a humiliating work environment. Initially being just like an ant among others, he joins a labor union and fights not only for his own rights, but for the rights of all “ants” in Japan’s workforce.","popularity":0.812,"poster_path":"/6s14PyvjV57dNNl9jV6xksu7IyG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Ant Strikes Back","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
