Rocket From the Crypt","overview":"After fifteen years of unconventionally kinetic stage antics (sometimes involving fire breathing, on-stage raffles, and a guy named \"Dirty\" who was essentially the band's resident cheerleader), the band gave their bittersweet farewell performance for an army of costume-clad fans - some of which even flew in from other countries - on their favorite day of the year to perform, Halloween. And here you have it, the band's final live performance from San Diego's Westin Hotel Ballroom, marking the end of an era and the affirmation of their cemented presence in the slightly emptier world of rock n' roll.
