For over 45 years a bitter independence struggle has been fought there between native Papuans and the occupying Indonesian regime, largely unnoticed by the outside world. It is estimated that at least 500,000 Papuans have been killed since the occupation of their land began. Thousands more have been victims of human rights abuses or 'disappeared' for voicing their support of the independence movement. Forgotten Bird of Paradise provides a rare and moving insight into a long forgotten struggle, and reveals how the Papuan peoples resilience and determination for freedom burns stronger now than at any time in history.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":"/zZhsyWvMV3oRMhpBcolC0opWvZA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42215,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dancing Turtle Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgotten Bird of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
