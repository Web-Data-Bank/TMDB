But, as his troubled reign unfolds, he is consumed by guilt over the means by which he attained the highest power. What legacy will he leave to his frightened children and people?  Conceived to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the magnificent St Alexander Nevsky Memorial Cathedral at the heart of the city in 2014, Sofia National Opera performed in the open air at the entrance to the building. The production also commemorated the 100th anniversary of Boris Christoff and 85th of Nicolai Ghiaurov, the two great Bulgarian basses who were the outstanding exponents of the title role during the second half of the 20th century. Todayâ€™s Bulgarian artists combined forces to present this spectacular and unique tribute.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v8agjN3kSRWwaKQIkwgQRQvEYhS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boris Godunov - SOFIA OPERA AND BALLET","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
