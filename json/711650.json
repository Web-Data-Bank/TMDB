First and second generation Black and Asian immigrants, as well as ex-National Front members, paint a detailed picture of discrimination in 1970s Britain. The film uses lo-fi animation, archive footage and a pulsating soundtrack to compare racial inequality in London to Britain's colonial 'divide and rule' policy, European fascism and the rise of Nazi Germany.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oU7dCzJHuITimjxHnCX7avM42Gi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Newsreel Collective","origin_country":""},{"id":159629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians","origin_country":""},{"id":159630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allen Lane Trust","origin_country":""},{"id":159631,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.C.T.T.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divide and Rule - Never!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
