Is it because, as some say, she isn't very good at being Black? If so how can she improve? And what is being Black anyway? A humorous journey which takes us from leafy North London to the wilds of County Cork in a bid to understand the nature of sex and race in 21st century Britain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Film Is Meant to Be About Stokely Carmichael","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
