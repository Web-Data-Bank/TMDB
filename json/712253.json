As the fastest aging country in the world, which also severely limits immigration, Japan finds itself undergoing a depopulation that has led to the shrinking of some communities. Speculating on a \"post-society\" landscape where the natural world is taking over, the causal links between industrialized society and fragile eco-systems finds parallels in our sudden dramatic awareness of nature’s autonomy, as the presumption of our ability to maintain and control the natural world comes under question.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xFA3z1BYmJbksz5TIjbFCqO1P81.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Extinguishment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
