The exchange was filmed by a team of students from both schools and developed into a 40-minute documentary titled, “One Education, Two Systems”.  The aim of the project was to develop mutual understanding and appreciation between students at international schools and traditional local schools in Hong Kong and help bridge the divide in the education system. At the same time, the documentary also seeks to spark discussion on education-related topics, various disparities and other differences between the two systems (teaching styles, mental health, learning attitude, general atmosphere and competitiveness).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fmM4BS7aLFoZ26TtPb2NLDEgIRw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135096,"logo_path":null,"name":"CIS CPG","origin_country":""},{"id":135097,"logo_path":null,"name":"WOW Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2017-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Education, Two Systems","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
