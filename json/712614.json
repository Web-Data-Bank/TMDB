During the Middle Ages between Christmas and Epiphany, everything was turned topsy-turvy. The poor could mock the rich, the humble could deride the powerful. A “fool’s pope” was elected and one could disguised himself as a bull, a cow, a deer or other pagan divinities. In New Orleans, the carnival has preserved this sense of liberty. Suddenly, everything is permitted, even the most absurd extravagance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carnaval Nouvelle-Orléans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
