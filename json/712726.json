Birds, and ducks in particular, are like role models for humans— they find ways to survive by various means across varied terrain. I hope to bring together a mix of local birds and migratory ones, migrating across different generations of  moving image media.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yYeGmEQ5uCaevpn3KwAemHEkwEe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A child dies, a child plays, a woman is born, a woman dies, a bird arrives, a bird flies off","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
