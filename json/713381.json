With no resources to mend the wounds, the two sides, North and South, took different paths to find homes and families for the war orphans.  While the children of South Korea were sent to Europe and the United States through ‘International Adoption’, the children of North Korea were distributed across Eastern Europe through a method called ‘Commissioned Education’.  As a result, more than five thousand children from the North had to spend nearly a decade living in foreign lands across Eastern Europe.  This story is a record of their lives, which used to be kept hidden from the rest of the world.  There is a key to understanding how North Korea's closed political structure began and how the ‘Juche ideology’ was formed in this documentary movie. Understanding North Korea in the 1950s is an important way to understand North Korea at present.","popularity":0.607,"poster_path":"/eCHUScSrkxVRxJ1kOq5oXNQ6OJV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kim Il Sung's Children","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
