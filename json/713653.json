It remained submerged until a few years ago, but a climate cycle of intense drought exposed the remains of a ghost town. In the fantasies of each protagonist, a common thread is being developed; they relate their own experiences and feelings that arise from what happened. In his illusions there is a look to the future. They maintain the hope that not everything has been lost and that Epecuén will resurface.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9fLfmevidNQVLEkj6LXH7G9YU07.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En los ojos de la memoria","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
