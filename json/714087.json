It's also a sometimes humorous, sometimes heartrending portrayal of his family's changing perceptions of the process of death. It follows the final day in the life of an elderly patriarch who has lapsed into an intermittent coma. As he dies, his son returns home to visit the family, where he unexpectedly participates in an ancient ritual of ancestral origins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":135403,"logo_path":null,"name":"ParaTheatrical ReSearch","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oracle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
