Sequestered behind the cramped counter, Pianelli films the world as it passes before her with a boundless sense of curiosity and compassion. iPhone or GoPro strategically set up before her, she records idiosyncratic interactions with charming regulars who drop by for their newspapers and a chat, or the lost passers-by simply looking for directions. Le Kiosque is a tender study of humanity, as well as a bittersweet sketch of physical media’s dying days as the newsstand’s future becomes increasingly unclear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/50OzMXuGEuPc0cjFMDEJMJqA8xW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120889,"logo_path":"/3ww1BpkpNPGHU8n3uHV0rFJA7QD.png","name":"Les Films de l’œil sauvage","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kiosk","video":false,"vote_average":6.917,"vote_count":6}
