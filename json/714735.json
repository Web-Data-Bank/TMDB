Scenes chronicling Howard’s doomed romance with Scandinavian girl friend Turid Aarsted are interwoven with scenes detailing Howard’s relationship with his parents and with a former girl friend, as well as his failed attempts at moviemaking. One sequence depicts Aarsted leaving the thirty-seven-year-old Howard for the film’s cameraman, Paul Goldsmith, and includes a sex scene between the new lovers. In off-screen commentary, producer Kenneth E. Schwartz expresses concern about the film’s content. He reveals that he raised $50,000 for the project, complains to the viewer that the film was not supposed to be a “diary of freaky people.” Eventually he and Howard come to terms about the film’s direction and allow the film’s story to unfold unobstructed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snapshots","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
