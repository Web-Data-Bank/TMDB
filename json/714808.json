It explores Garvey’s dramatic successes and failures before his fall into obscurity. Among the film’s most powerful sequences are interviews with people who were part of the Garvey movement decades ago. These interviews communicate the appeal of Garvey’s revolutionary ideas to a generation of African Americans, and reveal how he invested hundreds and thousands of black men and women with a newfound sense of pride.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hPWJvkVxjvTMI025B4nd44pNLaL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102728,"logo_path":"/tOOe8I9qPC2qdpqTd3HMetSmyy3.png","name":"Firelight Media Inc.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bold.
