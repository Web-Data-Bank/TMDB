Building upon the analysis put forward in our 2018 documentary, History is Marching, and our 2019 short film, An Atlantic Tide, it covers the US-China trade war, the \"phase one\" US-China deal, Hong Kong, the politicisation of the coronavirus, conflicts between the EU imperialist bloc and the US, Brexit, the resurgence of a Turkish colonialism, the US dollar and oil, and the US' push toward drastic escalation in the Middle-East.  They are in free fall. We are the solution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c6QEXIcoZveBbx9KIunyrTraOvW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Under Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
