In this short period of time, each of them witnesses something which makes them think about themselves. The young Willem accidently witnesses a couple making love in the bushes and doesn't know how to deal with this. Roos, a real 'tomboy', starts thinking about who she wants to be, after another girl confuses her for being a boy. Kees, a divorced man, thinks he has a flirt with a younger woman. When he finds out she wasn't flirting at all, he realizes that he has entered a new period of his life where he has to find his place. The three characters separately all experience a small tilt in their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4ep1jKONHgiQFGbqgwls5XNslBu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nederlandse Filmacademie","origin_country":""},{"id":108999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Room for Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2015-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Today","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
