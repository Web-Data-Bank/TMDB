After living in Sweden for two years, Herb Gildin and his sisters journeyed all the way across the Pacific to be reunited with their parents as refugees in America. Focused on building his business rather than dwelling on his past, decades went by before Herb told his wife and children about his childhood, resulting in one last journey back to Sweden to reunite with the remaining family members who had taken him in 60 years earlier.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Bd1oJpSltgJtKgSbCaCXikKQk5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Starfish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
