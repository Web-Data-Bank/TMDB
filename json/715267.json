The tone was set very quickly: \"To wake up is to be born again in the world of despair.\" 'On Sunday afternoon' is a film all at once clinical and theoretical on melancholy in the strong sense of the famous \"black bile\" of the Greeks whose author seems to want to make a complete turn, from his tragic dimension to his psychological dimension, even ending his film with a long quote from Freud's 'Mourning and Melancholia'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wCR71o6CdaSSDeNGXbWNVlWzakZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Sunday Afternoon","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
