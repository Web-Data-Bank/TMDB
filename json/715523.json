As the US and Germany grapple with racism, nationalism, and a fight against diversity, our protagonists move from their 20s into their 30s and face major turning points in their lives: fighting for citizenship, starting families, and finding room for creative expression. Spanning a decade in two of the world’s largest centers of immigration, this sensitive and nuanced documentary captures their journeys to define what it means to “belong” in societies that are increasingly hostile to their existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/szwiJF61udIG1fj3s8NoEu6P41z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
