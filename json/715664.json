The narrative runs in reverse, rewinding the clock on deforestation to undo the damage caused by the unsustainable production of one of the worldâ€™s most versatile commodities. Beyond the industrialisation of the land, we end at the beginning, a thriving eco-system alive with wildlife. The concept mirrors the real world action of the NGOs Sumatran Orangutan Society and their partners in reclaiming land on the borders of the Leuser rainforests to rewild them with indigenous trees, expanding the boundaries of one of the most biodiverse places on Earth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4GKF9FnI3RZLzTkpAM3SOm5qk38.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2019-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rewild","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
