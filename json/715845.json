That summer it had been twenty years since we had walked on the moon. I was jealous of that, so I decided to paint my walls to make a lunar decoration. During the fall I traveled across Europe and wrote a lot. Moona Luna is the result of these two moments.\r This is my first trip to the moon. On the set I authorized Doctor Bonami to become Mr. Bad Actor. Virgins always say everything, so I kept the first shot. The story evokes three sailors working on a French boat and a professor of physics. There may not be whales, but there are many other things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5goR41g9XIjwivdhs2KW8wQ9BnY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moona Luna","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
