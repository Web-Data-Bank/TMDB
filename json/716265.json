Brett Kebble was a charismatic South African businessman whose meteoric rise to fame and fortune in the mining world was followed by a startling fall from grace. His life ultimately ended in a hail of bullets on a road in northern Johannesburg in 2005. But the story behind his death is so bizarre that it could come straight out of a mystery thriller. In this documentary, the three self-confessed killers, as well as Jackie Selebi, Glen Agliotti, Piet Byleveld, and the Kebble family, are interviewed, exploring a fascinating tale of greed, corruption, fraud, and murder. Exclusive first-hand accounts of the murder are included, and the belly of South Africa's dark underworld is revealed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eMWfqSUm3Eo5YGNsiU1x2hWrfXg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135815,"logo_path":null,"name":"204 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The shocking story behind the murder of Brett Kebble.","title":"204: Getting Away with Murder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
