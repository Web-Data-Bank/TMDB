On the streets during the recent protests in NYC, I felt an obligation to use my privilege to tell stories as an attempt to bridge gaps. Some might call protestors “agitators”, “trouble makers” or even “criminals”. What I found were impassioned human beings. In this piece three young leaders in the #blacklivesmatter movement are followed. There were no emails, or phone calls. I simply approached them on the street. Their passion for justice, and for reforming our beleaguered policing system was inspiring. This is meant to be a real life look in the moment and on the streetIt’s an open discussion about police violence and about protest.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Week In June","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
