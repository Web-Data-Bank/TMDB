Since NAFTA, 9/11 and the Obama and Trump administrations border residents have been on the front-lines of the humanitarian crisis caused by increased border enforcement build up. Undeterred is an intimate and unique portrait of how residents in a small rural community, caught in the cross-hairs of global geo-political forces, have mobilized to demand our rights and to provide aid to injured, oft times dying people funneled across a wilderness desert. The film was made by Eva Lewis, a resident of Arivaca and long time member of People Helping People in the Border Zone (PHP). Undeterred was created in close collaboration with the Arivaca community and members of PHP.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Undeterred","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
