Don't do this Marie...he's telling her, this can only end badly, Steve says. Marie looks at him with a reassuring smile. This is the right decision, she knows it is, Marie says, patting his leg. \"You know how teenagers are. It's only a matter of time before she starts experimenting, and once she does...that'll be it...we won't be able to protect her anymore,\" she says.  In the bedroom, Rachel (Christiana Cinn) suggests that he put a blindfold on so that he can't see when they have sex. Tim's (Dick Chibbles) not too sure about it, but when Rachel explains that she finds it very erotic, he agrees and covers his eyes. Don't worry, she'll take good care of you, Rachel says, but seems to say it a little louder than is necessary. Tim's eyes may be closed, but when he opens them, he's in for a rude awakening.","popularity":1.511,"poster_path":"/rvhSebWa74UWlg6KwmyX1wixTZ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Careful What You Wish For","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
