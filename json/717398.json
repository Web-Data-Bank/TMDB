The film chronicle covering two years can be viewed as a continuation to Sööt's earlier films \"Year of the Dragon\" and \"Year of the Horse\". All three documentaries are the portraits of years, modelled by the director himself. There is neither a systematic nor exhaustive approach towards the selected times in history - what has been followed is the chronological order of events. Andres Sööt documents and comments both from a neutral as well as his personal point of view.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kwqkYVuYUL7QLexCb4YFMWGJ41q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pictures from the XXth Century Estonia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
