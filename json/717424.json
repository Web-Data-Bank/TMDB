Animated in stereoscopic stop-motion, Winnipeg filmmaker Megan Turnbull's film creates a magical, miniature world entirely of out paper sculpture and pure invention. This film was made as part of the 6th edition of the NFB's Hothouse apprenticeship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xR7vM2CAXDdSw8gwh45x13E512w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unlaced","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
