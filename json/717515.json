This film pokes fun at tropes of women within horror cinema specifically the \"vanity girl,\" the \"mystical pregnancy,\" and \"running/final girl\" tropes. It's dark but humorous. It's inky but colorful. Itâ€™s a blending of media; film and video, digital and analog, with references to the internet, cinema, psychedelia, and pop music. This film was digitally shot and manipulated with the Sandin Image Processor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4THREEgc9uQElVyYjFKAVfha7kr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Can Run, She Can Hide","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
