He became an international sensation in 1966 with his one-man mission for peace that inspired John Lennon to immortalize his name in the song “Give Peace a Chance”. He ran a pirate radio station, organized humanitarian aid missions and was imprisoned for his secret meetings with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
