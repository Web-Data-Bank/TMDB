Based on the book of the same name by Andrés Sopeña, it evokes, from the present, his memories of that time: everyday school, local radio, Roberto Alcázar's comics, Thursday cinema with Franco opening swamps and \"Yon Güein\" chasing and killing Indians. Through the childish eyes of a child Sopeña (Daniel Rubio) and his schoolmates, we discover a way of understanding the world, society and a Spain \"of glories and flowery pensil\", as the national anthem of those years used to sing.","popularity":1.033,"poster_path":"/ffsEysxyHFDYNfyytbHqi9W3CBZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34247,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Entertaiments S.L.","origin_country":""},{"id":20193,"logo_path":"/oz1p4QkoNONJZ3JT6BF6Jj4Nw2l.png","name":"The Walt Disney Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2002-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El florido pensil","video":false,"vote_average":5.583,"vote_count":6}
