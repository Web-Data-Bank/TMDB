They are thinking to themselves about their problems, and we hear their thoughts as voice over monologues. Soon they start exchanging casual glances; they find each other very attractive, and, separately but simultaneously, they start to fantasize about what would happen if they got together that night. They get really excited with this game in their minds; It's almost like they've fallen in love at first sight. And then they hear the train coming... they have to take a decision: Will they dare to say to each other what they're feeling before it's too late?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eGZzmKIPR3nCPpJgJJsnMiAxo2n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1993-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El columpio","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
