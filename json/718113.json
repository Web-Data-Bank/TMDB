Ever since, the area has known extensive, community-wide victimization by racist members of the Tulsa law enforcement community. In April 2015, a Reserve Deputy killed Eric Harris, an unarmed suspect, as he ran from members of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7ZjJ4yo6K76U5i8oFA5RgwH2byI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"State of Fear: Murder and Memory on Black Wall Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
