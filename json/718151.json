After a long day trying to maintain her #girlboss status at work, Blake's one-track mind is solely set on the nachos Q has promised to make for dinner. In addition to the nachos, however, Q has also unexpectedly managed to kill someone in their apartment. Through a series of heavily graphic and hilarious situations, the girls tap into their inner serial killers and decide to handle the body themselves. Their naivete and inexperience leads to a weekend full of accidental drugs, Saran Wrap, and body that, for whatever reason, will not stop bleeding. So hypothetically speaking - how do you get rid of a body? Asking for a friend.","popularity":0.639,"poster_path":"/4npthRtVCvhozl8CTGU5ECCmijq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edelweiss Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"So hypothetically speaking - how do you get rid of a body?
