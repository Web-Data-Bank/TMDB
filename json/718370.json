A grassroots movement to get colleges, city councils, and states to divest their holdings in companies doing business in South Africa spreads across the entire nation pressuring the U.S. Congress to finally sanction South Africa. This stunning victory is won against the formidable opposition of President Ronald Reagan. African-Americans significantly alter U.S. foreign policy for the first time in history. European sanctions follow, and with them, the political isolation of the apartheid regime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gU4Zj3UCngOZSPCJiWTojV63akt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Have You Heard from Johannesburg: From Selma to Soweto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
