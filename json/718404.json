Despite his popularity, both in Puerto Rico as well as in Latin America, he remains a simple, sincere and lovable person. This 25-minute film explores the life of Andy Montañez through the eyes of his mother Doña Celina. She describes his rise to fame from a mother's perspective, making clear the pride she feels for the oldest of her 18 children. Combined with Doña Celina's narrative, are comments from Danny Rivera, a popular Puerto Rican singer, Nick Quijano, a San Juan graphic artist and Cuco Peña, a renowned music composer.
