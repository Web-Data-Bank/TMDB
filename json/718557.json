They have no money, no connections, no relatives, except for grandmothers who regularly send half of their pension, but they have youth, joy in life, a sense of humor and the hope that they will surely “break through” and they will have everything well. In this situation, you can even live on a scholarship. Everything would be fine if the students didn’t have a seemingly simple task in one day: to get 40 thousand rubles in two weeks to participate in the Roscosmos project competition with their own promising development. It would seem ridiculous money for a city like Moscow. But absolutely not funny for poor students - sophomores.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":103977,"logo_path":null,"name":"Кинокомпания Сергея Безрукова","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beggars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
