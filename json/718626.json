The film borrows the form of the stream of consciousness (dream of a garden tour)-the taste of Guilin rice noodles separated more than 40 years ago, the 10-year re-visit of Suzhou gardens, the dark kingdom on the stage, and the journey of lectures and lectures. With special encounters and literary history, one person has led the trend of several generations. He is uniquely strong and courageous, exquisite and affectionate. He echoes the symphony in the film and leads the audience to gradually touch the hot novelist's mind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xcB8gGfYhfsEOjWlIceEHTvtILc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inspired Island: Multiflorate Splendour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
