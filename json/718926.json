The score to Circus On is a set of directions for creating an audio performance piece based on a text. First, one is instructed to \"write through\" a book (using mesostic form) to distill a text for recitation (i.e. Cage's Writing for the Second Time through Finnegans Wake). This mesostic text is then used as a guide to make a \"circus of relevant sounds.\" The recited text and \"circus of sounds\" are combined to create a stereo recording (i.e. Cage's Roaratorio).  This project is about translation. It is about the translation of a score for music into a \"score\" for video and film. It is about translating Cage's ideas and aesthetics in the world of sound into the visual realm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vKrlyxZ9ESYdkbwi9gNXlKLblpC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CAGE: A Filmic Circus On Metaphors On Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
