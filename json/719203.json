The film \"Sun 100\" was intended to be a document of that work, representing the country and the nation thinking about a specific quandary: What is the spiritual heritage that's been left behind by Mao Zedong, if there is any at all? Wen planned for the film to show at the 1994 Hong Kong Film Festival, but withdrew it, and has never finished it, stating that his own views on Mao have shifted. 17 discs worth of footage (roughly 28 hours) from the unfinished film are included in the Wen Pulin Avant-Garde Art Archive held at Cornell University in the U.S.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ajD9D7YiYhrQnlBYW5rFtNLfokw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":999,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sun 100","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
