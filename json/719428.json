In the confusion of their short encounter they fail to give their names and exchange addresses. They go back to living their lives without the prospect of seeing each other again.\r From then on, the dream of true love interrupts the sober routine of their daily lives.\r Their longing for love increases and draws them back to the place where they met - and they barely miss noticing each other there. In the turmoil of the city in which they live there are moments when they just fail to run into each other by chance. Their short meeting has transformed their lives as well as their dreams. Perhaps they will find true love when they least expect to find it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b1ebv9XTCHqdruB5tEyxulDIInq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224,"logo_path":null,"name":"wega film vienna","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"True Love","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
