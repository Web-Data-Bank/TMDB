He came to know a country that was developing at an admirably fast pace, was swayed by its energy, and for a moment believed that modernity could bring about political change as well. Before long, it dawned on him that many people would continue to be severely punished, and the regime would still keep most of the nation in a state of indecision and ignorance. Without neglecting that face of China today, Etzler chose to tell a story of hope in his personal documentary. Using the example of an orphanage for disabled children, he shows that the answer to collectivist brutality and ruthlessness can be mutual assistance, tolerance and empathy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pw7sagnCMA2NFpioWQl29RqeIQm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117757,"logo_path":"/qF5tbJOK8ppkY08ESKlGtj6762t.png","name":"Mimesis Film","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
