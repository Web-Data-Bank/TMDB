The group quickly became the face of the UK's subversive political and musical underground, gaining notoriety amongst fans and the music press as being the last of a dying breed: a punk rock outfit so loud, vulgar, and iconoclastic that they couldn’t be ignored.  This run n' gun documentary follows the controversial group on tour in the U.S. It is an intimate portrait of a band struggling with the music business, drug addiction, poverty, and each other, as they rocket across the great American hinterland. The film features appearances by Fat White Family admirers Lady Gaga, Sean Lennon, Mark Ronson, Cynthia ‘Plaster Caster’ Albritton, and the long, strange American highway.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pSLA3tE1OdOF224PWZMWkcmqfwn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136446,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instant Coffee Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"'You don't see that every night...it's the Fat White Family, everybody.' -- David Letterman","title":"Utter Bliss: Lost in America with the Fat White Family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
