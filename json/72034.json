When Hor-Shep-Sut's sarcophagus is found by Dr. Wallis Harwa  and opened by Professor Carter Moore, the professor's fianc√©e, Ana, immediately faints at the sight of the horrific, but somehow oddly familiar mummified remains. As Hor-Shep-Sut awakens from her centuries-old slumber to pursue her long lost love, viewers can rest assured that she will certainly have her fair share of erotic encounters before meeting her ultimate fate.","popularity":4.008,"poster_path":"/2c8AjgX0ofpP24QEZXDhLw4M7SV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mummy's Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":3.375,"vote_count":4}
