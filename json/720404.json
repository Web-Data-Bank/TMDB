The sonic suspension imposed by the computerized slowness of the subjectless reader frames the deep time dimension of this arid dusty landscape in Wendover. We are led through details of the manual, which suggests forms to best-adapt to the terrain, climate, soil conditions in the pit area, to allow for the needed cleanliness and security precautions for Boeing B-29 atomic bomb loading.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sLW12D5EHVjlxEeGVn4UXVNCjYL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loading Pit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
