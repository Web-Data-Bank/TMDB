Martin is a policeman, while Nikolai, Ralf, and Timo can't distinguish between personal possessions and the possessions of others! When all four find themselves in a fix, they're forced to return to their former tricks against a common foe, Mr Niemeyer. Martin is not as successful, however, either at his job or marriage, and thinks he deserves a better life. Now he sees an opportunity to save his career by \"playing\" with his old friends on a mission that is so crazy that even the two foolish brothers can do some good.","popularity":1.742,"poster_path":"/cKikIufxCbwfm3hURGQGQaoIZLT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fridthjof Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2011-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All for One","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":25}
