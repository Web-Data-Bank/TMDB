PINAFORE makes arrangements for his daughter to marry the Lord Admiral of the Navy. However, problems ensue when his daughter reveals she’s in love with a low-ranking seaman aboard her father’s ship. Ironically, the Captain finds himself in a similar position with a dockside vendor called Little Buttercup. The whole situation is turned on its head when Little Buttercup reveals a game-changing secret she has kept for decades...  This is no ordinary production of G&S. It fairly zings along, bubbling with joie de vivre, good humour and spice. However, you won't like this version of Pinafore if you're a strict G&S traditionalist. Considerable liberties are taken with the script; two songs are left out and several songs adapted from other G&S operas are added; Act II has been radically changed - and the music is played on three Moog synthesizers, with never a violin in sight!","popularity":1.475,"poster_path":"/wcV3JWvwIZzvRrArgdkDIjef8UE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HMS Pinafore","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
