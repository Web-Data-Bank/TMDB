In total, more than a thousand hours of work were needed to prepare Brazilian Cinema in the 20th Century. The work is a fascinating journey through all the cinematic cycles that Brazil lived, from the pioneering Belle Époque, through the great studios like Atlântica and Cinédia, Cinema Novo, the urban comedies of the 70's, until the resumption in the late 90's. The documentary is unique, it gives the floor to who really wrote and lived this story intensely.","popularity":0.672,"poster_path":"/yhBAkjon5q8ryzmONSvsNKQZ16h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Youle Filmes","origin_country":""},{"id":136609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Book Filmes Ltda","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brazilian Cinema in the 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
