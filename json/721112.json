Starting from the first recorded murder of one person by another (the Cain and Abel brothers), the author of the film tried to create a situation in which the next organized war appears in all its futility and anti-humanity.  The main points are not military scenes, but rather the relatively innocuous thoughts of the main character: El Pablo against his will was sent to war, with people to whom he does not feel hatred.  The film \"Abel\" stands out primarily for its alternative approach to short films, while preserving at the same time many of the principles of the art genre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cu4UNENatwgY1RtcTTTnJ4YBrl1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
