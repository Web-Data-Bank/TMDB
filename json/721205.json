Our experiences, senses, intuitions, and emotions are filtered by a neurological system that then presents us with a simulated reality guided by its own rules and internal logic. In a way, Dream is more of an alternate reality than a virtual reality; it is a brief immersion in a parallel dimension that asks us to reconsider our relationship to both our dreaming and waking states.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9eUyuI771X1CVz63IUeZiqG2U25.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
