Who is Anton LaVey? Where is he from? Why does he do that? It does not take much to imagine the worst. Orgiastic ceremonies, where one revels in the blood of virgins, moonlight lamb sacrifices, noise concerts in the basement of a historical buildingâ€¦ No, really nothing that amusing among the activities in the Church of Satan. Anton LaVey is nothing like a horned Charles Manson, and his path is all the more unexpected. Nick Bougas allows us to discover the artist, the musician, the philosopher, all through hallucinatory images retrieved from archives, making this rare documentary only two years before the author of the Satanic Bible disappeared.","popularity":1.061,"poster_path":"/9C3gdDLMaBaARxaRBNnufvDzX3J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wavelength Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The world, legacy, music, loves, rituals, careers and philosophies of Anton Szandor LaVey.","title":"Speak of the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
