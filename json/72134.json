The performance captures Bon Jovi in an intimate, \"in the round\" experience, performing acoustic and electric renditions of classic hits (Bon Jovi and non-Bon Jovi tracks), new material from Keep the Faith, and also behind the scenes footage. The show took place at the Kaufman's Studios Astoria in Queens, New York City in 1992, and released commercially in 1993. To date it is the only live home video that has not been re-issued on DVD.","popularity":0.743,"poster_path":"/nWdMwxzDgcNJYh1mJXMTemLuahx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keep the Faith: An Evening With Bon Jovi","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
