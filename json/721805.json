A wedding where everything goes wrong, a banquet where everything suddenly shatters. Without words but in a universal language, the characters love each other, confront each other, meet again, and get lost in a funny and hectic whirlwind.  After the immense success of Open Space and when Mr. X was created with Pierre Richard, Mathilda May continues to make us dream and presents us here with a unique fresco. An exceptional spectacle.","popularity":1.104,"poster_path":"/yi7yyw0SurIh2J8xVgcr1QbLKlH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Banquet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
