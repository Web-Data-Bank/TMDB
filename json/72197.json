In an Adventure with Scientists!","overview":"The luxuriantly bearded Pirate Captain is a boundlessly enthusiastic, if somewhat less-than-successful, terror of the High Seas. With a rag-tag crew at his side, and seemingly blind to the impossible odds stacked against him, the Captain has one dream: to beat his bitter rivals Black Bellamy and Cutlass Liz to the much coveted Pirate of the Year Award. Itâ€™s a quest that takes our heroes from the shores of exotic Blood Island to the foggy streets of Victorian London. Along the way they battle a diabolical queen and team up with a haplessly smitten young scientist, but never lose sight of what a pirate loves best: adventure!","popularity":12.54,"poster_path":"/bkLeXPDP6sramrTiF5W7TzUl4t0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":297,"logo_path":"/58TnhYZqbMYgkHM6lg7dJoYJ4RH.png","name":"Aardman","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-03-12","revenue":123054041,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's a plunderful life","title":"The Pirates!
