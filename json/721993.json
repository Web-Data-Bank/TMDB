When Nicholas Briggs first talked to Nicola in 1985, Doctor Who had been cancelled (for the first time) and its future was uncertain.  Eleven years later in 1996, they met again to discuss her last season in the programme and life after Doctor Who.  Both interviews are combined in this Myth Makers, giving us a fascinating insight into Nicola’s evolving life and career.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rb5PyLiu6QQ1MSYKB32061OFJph.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1985-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 6: Nicola Bryant","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
