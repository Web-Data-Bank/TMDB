We see his paint table (he drinks Medaglia d'Oro and eats Skippy peanut butter in the country), his studio, the green view out the door. We see his models. We see him laugh as he works. We see a fly land on his T-shirt, at the shoulder. We see his paintings, lots of them, in detail and from across the room, still shots and gentle, sinuous pans. We see his enormous Times Square billboard in progress, then finished. We see a show being hung, and the opening, where the people inevitably begin to resemble the art on the wall - such a funny and exquisite sensation! And over it all we hear Alex talking to us about his work, talking about style and influence and perception in the most straight-forward way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alex Katz Painting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
