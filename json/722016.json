Join us in a bold and exciting expedition to the Titanic's resting place 12,500 feet below the surface; a mission as technologically challenging and daring as a trip to the Moon!  Witness explorations in and around the Titanic: the retrieval of a ship's safe, navigation equipment, china, and more; plus interviews with survivors and renowned experts.  It's the complete saga of the Titanic, from construction to catastrophe and finally, discovery... in one compelling home video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xkK8lCPVcyFRBowXd7Wtu7pqNt4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The adventure continues...","title":"Treasures of the Titanic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
