Based on the experience of his short film Les Indes galantes, the artist updates Jean-Philippe Rameau's baroque masterpiece (1735) by bringing together lyric song and urban dance.  The choreography is entrusted to Bintou Dembélé who supervises dancers from krump, popping, voguing or even experimental hip hop.  From rehearsals to the Premiere, Philippe Béziat films the meeting of urban dancers with the lyric institution and invites the spectator to share a human and artistic experience.","popularity":1.339,"poster_path":"/mQXBnWEZk2YbzncD4TzAd768wWl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12389,"logo_path":"/6yilbEvoHtPcTb4LwAueAq091iT.png","name":"Les Films Pelléas","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gallant Indies","video":false,"vote_average":7.727,"vote_count":11}
