Halodiya Choraye Baodhan Khaye, 1987). The forest ranger confronts illegal timber merchants and contractors on behalf of impoverished tribals. The honest ranger’s activities get him into trouble and he is constantly transferred from one post to another, to the annoyance of his wife who wants him to settle down and look after their ailing child. Eventually she supports her husband’s fight and the tribals realise they need weapons to defend themselves against rapacious outsiders.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1990-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Assamese","iso_639_1":"as","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
