However, Henley reversed his decision and it was announced in March 2017 that the Eagles would perform in two festivals featuring classic rock bands organized by their manager Irving Azoff, starting with The Classic West festival held at the Dodger Stadium in July that year. Henley brought in Frey's son Deacon to perform with the remaining members of the Eagles in these shows after he saw Deacon performed Glenn Frey's songs at his memorial service.","popularity":3.692,"poster_path":"/3guBniXQpVQnwpHqei6kyVcgQ8C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34836,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":132657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eagles - Live from the Forum MMXVIII","video":false,"vote_average":8.6,"vote_count":5}
