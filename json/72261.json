Baer -- who also directed and co-wrote the film -- plays a sarcastic TV personality who decides to gather together the panel members from his live show before they shoot the program so that they have a chance to rehearse. To this end, the absurd group -- including a lawyer, a transvestite, and a grown woman who acts like a child -- rents a villa for a month. It doesn't take long for resentment to fester among the motley crew.","popularity":0.966,"poster_path":"/7K1OBtixhPKLN7kiwRE17Q7iYfS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La bostella","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":15}
