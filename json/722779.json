A young couple documents their vacation on the Baltic Sea, a garden plot community celebrates a party, and comrades from a sports club even film themselves playing cards underwater. The film's sarcastically humerous commentary on everyday life plays with clichés and taboos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a3BxRX7nDXcMNcUcZLjt5MFgfDA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA Studio für Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1956-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sommer, Sonne, AK 8","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
