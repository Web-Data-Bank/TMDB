Miners were told to stop working mid shift, and their last paychecks bounced. The miners retaliated by blocking a train full of coal, camping out on the coal tracks for weeks.

Sarah Moyer, a film maker living in Kentucky, also made their way to the encampment and filmed this short documentary on the blockade.
