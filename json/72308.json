Left without options or entrance visas, a beacon of hope materialized for them on the other side of the world, and in the unlikeliest of places, Japanese-controlled Shanghai. Fleeing for their lives, these Jewish refugees journeyed to form a settlement in the exotic city, penniless and unprepared for their new life in the Far East. At the turn of the new millennium, filmmakers Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amire Mann boldly snuck into China with two survivors and a digital camera to shoot at the site of the original Shanghai Ghetto, unchanged since WWII.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/pSnmc99khdKV0VmfYvAENK6T4ko.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In 1939, the last hope for thousands of Jews lay in the last place on Earth the Nazis would look.","title":"Shanghai Ghetto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
