The clich√©s of the sex worker as unable to receive or give love, lacking in agency, desperate and even unredeemable, are presented with overflowing evidence from some of Hollywood's most respected films. A fascinating insight into how cinema impacts real-world communities and a hopeful argument for the power of cinema to comfort and inspire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/92GsM2mBXHogY1G3gl1ji1ooOes.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whores on Film","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
