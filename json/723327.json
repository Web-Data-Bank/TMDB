A rising star, Harold Chapin had numerous one-acts and three full-length plays produced before he was killed on the battlefield in 1915 at the age of 29. “When Harold Chapin fell in France the modern British theatre lost a comic writer of high order,” declared the Sunday Times. “For intellectual foolery, his New Morality has no equal in present-day work.” The play was produced five years after his death to great acclaim, and then languished in obscurity for decades until our “lavishly crafted”1 revival introduced New York theatergoers to Chapin’s “unabashed comedy with bite.”2","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8hDMwGbHssSG2lZQmoWsBgXNROF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mint Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Morality","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
