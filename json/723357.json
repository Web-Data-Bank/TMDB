A workplace drama laced with biting humor, WOMEN WITHOUT MEN is set in the teacher’s lounge of a private girls’ boarding school in Ireland in the 1930s. The play explores the clash of conflicting natures and petty competitions that erupt amongst the school’s cloistered teaching staff.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rbfjElPYdpPn0p18k9hiP5sTwS2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mint Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women Without Men","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
