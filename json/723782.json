At a party, he meets a lively girl, Elaine, who half-jokingly agrees to be the student's leading lady. The natural growth of their relationship and how it is stunted is the basis for the film, and what happens to the spectator is that he recognizes, behind the laughter in the comic situation's shown, the tragic aversion of Americans to get really deeply involved with anything or anyone until absolutely necessary.\" - Albert Johnson, San Francisco International Film Festival","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whiskey Flats","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
