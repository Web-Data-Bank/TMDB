Many believe the Mothman to be a 1960’s phenomenon, an omen only appearing before tragedy, and disappearing after a flap of sightings and the subsequent Silver Bridge collapse in 1967. But what if there’s more? What if the origins of this omen trace back much further and go much deeper than anyone realized? And what if…the sightings never ended?","popularity":1.808,"poster_path":"/42XQddfnTyRNzejy0KZoL1bF3yy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100671,"logo_path":"/zU6uHxAsB6vlxwwvY8Il6FpbCds.png","name":"Small Town Monsters","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The forests of Appalachia hide an ancient secret...","title":"The Mothman Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8}
