We are always looking for an identity that can represent us, all looking for an answer to the question \"Who am I?\".  As soon as we leave the house we wear masks to experience at least for a few moments the illusion of being someone, \"I am the mask\", until unfortunately, once back in front of our comfortable mirror at home, we no longer know how to find ourselves and we still feel lost.  We need to have a new look at ourselves, discover who we are, find a new mirror to confront ourselves with, so as to truly discover who we really are.  Why not go in search of ourselves?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kdThDgzxeonHtJje9w6nJj8TxOP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who is it under your mask?","title":"Find Yourself","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
