Will the charismatic traveling preacher who sets his sights on her soul be her salvation, or her downfall? Carlisle Floyd’s all-American score, which beautifully evokes the work’s rural Appalachian setting, “is unabashedly neo-Romantic” (The New York Times). The radiant Patricia Racette sings the title role, with Brandon Jovanovich as her brother and Raymond Aceto as the hell-raising itinerant preacher. Conductor Karen Kamensek makes her San Francisco Opera debut in this eagerly awaited Company premiere directed by Michael Cavanagh.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t9Ao9TXlACC0u4hB3pfOCdfp0TY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20863,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Susannah","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
