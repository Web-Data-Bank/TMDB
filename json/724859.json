This slow-motion physical and optical puzzle, which Forsythe calls an \"entanglement\", is a choreographic event from which the common elements typically associated with choreography—the structural development of time and space and the visual isolation of parts—have been subtracted. The complex \"threading\" of the dancers' bodies into their own negative spaces creates visual conundrums that defy the apparent logic of the situation. The title is a play on words that, like the human situation it describes, threads two languages together: the English word \"align\", which sounds like the German word \"allein\" (alone), is fused with the German word \"Einigung\" (agreement).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4LoQtEai2dhqULWNT06IuC45CWf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alignigung II","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
