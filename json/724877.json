Occasionally reaching up to tweak the amplifier or manipulate the guitar pedal to produce screeching and howling feedback, Parrino uses the instruments unconventionally so that together they project a discordant noise. The artist masterfully draws the listener in to hear repetitions, subtle variations, and musical gestures in the unusual sonic palette. Shot by a lone cameraperson, the visuals of Parrino's performance become increasingly abstract as the music develops into a more familiar and alluring language.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/95NlLz44ELcVQZKu1mBHTIBHtpH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guitar Grind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
