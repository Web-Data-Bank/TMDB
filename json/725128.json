In 2019 he was evicted from that flat and had to say goodbye to the identity he had constructed for himself in the eight years he lived there.  You Build The Thing You Think You Are is an absurdist storytelling show about how we construct ourselves, about the accumulation of rubbish both in our heads and in our homes, about feeling more at home in your mind than in your body, and about the struggle to ever share any of this stuff with another human being.  It's about a Romanian Troll/Goblin thing who just wants to sing the hits and learn how to dance; about a Van Morrison gig that accidentally came to be the cornerstone of a personality; and about a gong bath so profound that it caused someone's spine to grow by two inches.","popularity":1.107,"poster_path":"/yPZ6R9u8k0gzBiwxiHwuqC2I3go.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Objectively Funny","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Build The Thing You Think You Are","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
