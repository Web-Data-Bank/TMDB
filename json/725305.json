In this beautifully crafted movie, Cowboys are the Indians. Hawaiiâ€™s Paniolo preceded the American Cowboy but their story remains virtually unheralded in frontier history. The film is a tribute to the men and women who learned much of their riding, roping, and saddle making from the great vaqueros of Alta California.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9px82kvzzcR7h7XYjwP3qDsEWki.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137347,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmWorks Pacific","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paniolo O Hawai'i: Cowboys of the Far West","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
