He seems to be a colourless, introverted, dull guy, who never raises his voice to anyone. As anger mounts inside him, he maintains his silent, awkward, weak appearance. Life goes by, boring and monotonous. Ihsan carries test tubes and x-rays to doctors, counts needles, finishes work and leaves the hospital to go home. He buys food, ignores the local guys who taunt him, obediently listens to his landlady who lives in the same building and who always has something to say, and eats a TV dinner thus completing another day. However, just as everyone, he has his dirty little secrets as well. The doctor is cheating on his wife, the nurse is doing drugs and Ihsan is involved in unusual activities at the morgue. This is a strange film about strange people doing strange things. 18 - Contains sexually explicit scenes that may be inappropriate for younger viewers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rqE4JG3W8Qjb3ePs3AkQ3hVgKjo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dönüşümfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2016-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nekro","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
