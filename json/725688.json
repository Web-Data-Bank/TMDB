It started with an idea in the underground subculture of Berlin shortly before the fall of the Wall. With the motto \"Peace, Joy, Pancakes\", Club DJ Dr. Motte and companions launched the first Love Parade. A procession registered as political demonstration with only 150 colorfully dressed people dancing to house and techno. What started out small developed over the years into the largest party on the planet with visitors from all over the world. In 1999, 1.5 million people took part. With the help of interviews with important organizers and contemporary witnesses, the documentary reflects the history of the Love Parade, but also illuminates the dark side of how commerce and money business increasingly destroyed the real spirit, long before the emigration to other cities and the Love Parade disaster of Duisburg in 2010, which caused an era to end in deep grief.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3iGWneaL9ETdabCg6GbPOsHXJSN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137801,"logo_path":null,"name":"solo:film","origin_country":""},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":35944,"logo_path":"/4KH89AIU5raRxMZ8pbywslRIt0S.png","name":"Das Erste (ARD)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Parade: When Love Learned to Dance","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
