Benny, an orderly at a nursing home, delicately balances his role as a caregiver to an ornery white resident who shares a contentious past with his white boss while at the same time caring for his own family as the fight for equality grips the nation in the midst of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. Thirty years later, his daughter, Ruby, struggles to understand an incident of police brutality against her 15-year-old son. This unique musical, spanning nearly half a century and three generations, asks us to contemplate the cycle of violence in this country and how we will find hope and create change against the backdrop of hate that plagues America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/auRjdsJ5IwrfCujJLBJYF8WsMSP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137469,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transport Group","origin_country":""},{"id":83624,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Public Theater (Oskar Eustis, Artistic Director; Patrick Willingham, Executive Director)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broadbend, Arkansas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
