What will be needed? Collect the men, find guns, or maybe someone will give them. We need a location, a country where the war would take place. No problem, the Colonel is a real pro, he has caused wars to order, or on orders, on multiple occasions in different countries. Now his followers have grown up and caused a war in his country. He doesn’t want to, but he has to fight. He is old and tired of war. He wants to be at the table with a steaming pot of tasty mutton ribs and stare at an innocent TV screen with the news on, and the dressed-up news reporter announces that the war has begun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dV01wvdBwXqAkGRsHUr4p9bCbYA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tremora","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2020-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flood Won’t Come","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
