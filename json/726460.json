Broadcast in 1986, it gave rise to “the biggest uproar in the history of British television”. Greek interviewees who lived through the events of that time speak openly about their experiences. The defeated Left fled into exile in 1949 and waited more than thirty years for the Amnesty of 1982 to return. After extensive coverage of the row in the British press, Channel 4 agreed that the series would not be shown again either in the UK or abroad. - Yanis Yanoulopoulos, Historical Advisor to the television series, Emeritus Professor, Panteion University","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z7eVLu6mxxjsQDIPxxQfBX2AU6g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10981,"logo_path":null,"name":"TVS Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":158,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greece: The Hidden War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
