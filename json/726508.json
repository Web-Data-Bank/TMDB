Historic text, petitions, and oral memory are brought to life through a vibrant all-indigenous cast. Scenes were shot at Historic Fort York and along the waterfront of the Toronto Purchase: the Don and Humber River’s and Etobicoke Creek.  The creek, which has never been ceeded, marks the disputed western boundary of the Toronto Purchase of 1787 and the eastern boundary of the 1805 Head of the Lake cession (treaties 13 and 14 respectively). It is now subject to a waterclaim by the Missisaguas of the Credit.  Rooted in Oral History and community collaboration, Talking Treaties is a multi-year project that artfully shares local indigenous history and awareness.  By these Presents: ‘Purchasing’ Toronto and accompanying installation were presented at the 2019 Toronto Biennial of Art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"\"Purchasing\" Toronto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
