They made happenings, music, art, posters and record sleeves, they performed together, organised workshops and toured. The film merges the different worlds they lived in – countryside and city life, and the various disciplines that were interwoven in their artistic practices. Some scenes also feature Eagle-Eye Cherry as a little boy and Neneh Cherry in her teens. Other musicians from that time include Collin Walcott, Rashied Ali, James Blood Ulmer and Naná Vasconcelos. Urban Lasson also appears in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Vc4L6KxGqcN1iFpDq2ezVBqFmC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Is Not My Music","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
