Four people running out from wedding room and shouting \"not me\", and then raised a knife to commit suicide. The process of the crime was watched by the guests, but they coincidentally pointed the finger at a weak girl, pointing out that she is the culprit behind the scene. Even the young girl herself confesses to the crime, revealing that she is a \"bad luck star\" who can't control those close to her. The death of an innocent watcher in the woods, the brutal death of a key figure in prison, and a mysterious village littered with corpses, all seem to be inextricably linked to the tragedy of death.","popularity":3.767,"poster_path":"/jl2gTLxg1VFPvsggYo1OFGCuGBz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Detective Dee: Solitary Skies Killer","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
