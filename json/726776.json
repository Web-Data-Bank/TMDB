There were 18 pregnancies in the insular seaside town of Gloucester, Massachusetts that year, in comparison to the usual three or four. Reporters from all over the world flooded Gloucester, turning the town into the center of an embarrassing scandal. As the definitive investigation of the Gloucester pregnancy pact, 'The Gloucester 18' talks to the girls and their families and the health officials who counseled them, many of whom are speaking for the very first time.
