Torrential rain has just put out the fire that in a single night ravaged Assandira, a farmstay deep in the woods of Sardinia. But the rain hasn't quenched the pain, the endless remorse for the son lost to the flames, the son he was unable to save. The first to arrive are the carabinieri and the young investigating magistrate: Costantino tries to tell them what happened the previous night, to explain how it all began.","popularity":0.878,"poster_path":"/6dLi0OOKmj2Myv32mUwonobKw0C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137603,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viacolvento","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":139858,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondazione Sardegna Film Commission","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Sardinian","iso_639_1":"sc","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assandira","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":9}
