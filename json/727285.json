Intrigued by the theory that Shakespeare wrote this play as a wedding gift, director Joseph Haj (who helmed 2015â€™s much-beloved Pericles) probes the pitfalls and pay-offs of relationships, be they budding or eternal. Seeking out the grace, beauty and delight embedded in the comedy, this joyful, music-laden production invites us to feel as well as laugh.","popularity":1.12,"poster_path":"/z0giy5I3tUftM4mkaJe52ulC3e2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137558,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oregon Shakespeare Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
