Or did they? Enter eager, determined, and untested Detective Justine Case. After sequestering the guests into separate rooms (because, you know, social-distancing), she gets down to finding out whodunnit, uncovering secret affairs, life-long grudges, backstage drama, and a lot of musical theater song and dance. Sifting through lies and red herrings and a truly baffling murder mystery script left by the deceased, Case vows to find the truth and secure her future as a great detective.","popularity":0.668,"poster_path":"/6UAXEz5CQLCTTzKoavSmg70Kz3H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What's in the soup?","title":"A Killer Party","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
