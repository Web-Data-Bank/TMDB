That moment would never happen. The quintet broke up and the compositions were lost for 50 years...until they were finally recovered by Miles’ only protégé, Wallace Roney--the one man Miles would trust to fulfill his wish. As Wallace prepares to record and debut \"Universe,\" he must find a way to uphold his mentor's legacy.
