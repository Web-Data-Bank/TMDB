The film follows the relentless defender of the EU along the roads of some 20 intertwined countries, but also goes out of the theatres to meet situations and faces. The black and white aplomb of the character BHL underlines, in contrast, the colourful dress of Princess Europe, whose frail fabric is woven of unevenly distributed wealth, memories of war and promises of struggle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2o97r8LttRkaBmJXF9AemeOR8Hx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Princesse Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
