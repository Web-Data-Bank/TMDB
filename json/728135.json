An unspoken trauma is their common history; rock n' roll their mutual saviour. Larsen's snakeskin-covered guitar and Rajae's liquid gold voice could be heaven, if only everything from his drug-induced visions to her music-buff pimp didn't get in the way. The only hope for their blooming romance is to skip this ferocious town. Is there a way out of this crazy Moroccan underworld with its menagerie of sadistic cops, venomous snakes, metal concerts and shotgun-wielding modern-day Calamity Janes? For these punk Romeo and Juliet, maybe the answer lies in a song - the one they've been writing and dreaming together : Zanka Contact","popularity":1.496,"poster_path":"/mAJfDOMSebeThNIhHL2gQK9gZle.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79322,"logo_path":"/txqLPA3VSO3PSKFB5Otp9kroHGd.png","name":"Barney Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":15362,"logo_path":"/aurALPPlHEmvVZHt6UnA3k408zn.png","name":"Velvet Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":123519,"logo_path":"/tU4qFvmGQDyvAvr0YPSnZiqewhP.png","name":"Mont Fleuri Production","origin_country":"MA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2021-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning Casablanca","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":7}
