As previously hinted at, the band submitted a plan to the festival's health and safety personnel, for a \"stunt\" involving a model UFO approaching the stage. This plan was rejected.  Bellamy wore red, Wolstenholme wore black and white and Dominic Howard wore a black shirt with blue trousers. Bellamy tossed his Manson Chrome Bomber across the stage at the end of Knights of Cydonia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/evfFt2A8zHOhAsq9lSLLxxpIQFw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muse: Live at V Festival 2008","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
