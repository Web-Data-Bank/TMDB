The venue was EMI's Abbey Road Studios.  Dan Newell, the band's live trumpeter, was drafted in for the first time at this performance. Matthew Bellamy can be seen playing/improvising a piece on the piano on video, which bears a slight resemblance to some of the piano work in Exogenesis: Symphony. It is pure speculation however whether this was one of the snippets of piano Bellamy used to put together the Symphony.  28th August 2006","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o40W4No61vBZeG7oZRk4MVcOmp9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muse: Live at Abbey Road 2006","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
