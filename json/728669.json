But deep down, she has another love, childhood sweetheart Li Zhu-Hao. Just when she sees the perfect opportunity to reveal her love to him from fortunetelling, Li Zhu-Hao confesses his feelings to her best friend Song Yi-Jing!  But Song Yi-Jing has a condition for Li Zhu-Hao, that is to help three couples to date. They are: aloof and misandric art professor Stone and lovesick gym owner Liu Zhi-Liang; the most unpopular weirdo in school, Ah-Yu, and the subject of her nonstop public displays of love, campus hunk Danny Lo; mob boss lady Yu and  philosophy student Ah-Shan. To make it happen for these three unlikely couples is almost like mission impossible.","popularity":1.375,"poster_path":"/hjD9WtY6xZQxRwPC34xNTfajOke.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sky Films Entertainment","origin_country":"TW"},{"id":4713,"logo_path":"/pdypzFmcHh5Uvd1u4X04NRXJNlp.png","name":"CMC Entertainment","origin_country":"TW"},{"id":196556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shine Time Entertainment Co., Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":126740,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lots Home Entertainment","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2020-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do You Love Me as I Love You","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":5}
