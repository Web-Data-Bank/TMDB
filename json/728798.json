Agricultural workers become aware of a strange phenomenon in the sky. People in rural locations discuss their observations. No-one knows what it is. Awareness of the phenomenon spreads; wildfires burn on heaths and panic is reported by newspapers. In the city, newspapers carry stories of earthquakes and changes affecting ‘the planets’. Extreme weather conditions are experienced. The changes are discussed on the streets. The day of final judgement is predicted by some. Uncertain of what is happening people hide indoors. A new day dawns and people venture outside. A large bright object fills the sky, collides with and destroys the earth.
