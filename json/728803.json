Mirko and Max meet in the forest and wander in abandoned places, trying to imagine a possible future, while Giorgia and Lorenzo live timid moments of intimacy. In the background, a daily life of a community of teenagers with ASD, who manage to live in balance between real and fantastic, physical and metaphysical, fear and pleasure of getting lost. They live “outside” time, a condition that allows them to experience an ephemeral present made of discoveries, rituals and relationships. Marana is a journey into the world of autism, where the desires of youth are narrated without preconceptions and recorded in their simple becoming.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hRR1lBn6cbnNMLaMyk2RdXNFCQQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
