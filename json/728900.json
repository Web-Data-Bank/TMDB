A creative documentary following the footsteps of the Ottoman-Armenian intellectual and traveler Eremya Celebi Komurciyan into the cosmopolitan Istanbul of the 17th century. Long before the invention of cinema, Komurciyan situates himself as a subject who observes the city of Istanbul as if he had a camera in hand. Borrowing Komurciyan’s timeless cine-eye, we delve into contemporary Istanbul to capture what is “inaccessible to the human eye” through the remnants of his route.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zPKTFtf7MK8yWiJr2KEM6EdeJZ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fenafilm","origin_country":""},{"id":66440,"logo_path":"/6E1e71bBg0FSEE4rJrFnsOURumV.png","name":"Elemag Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2020-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible to the Eye","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
