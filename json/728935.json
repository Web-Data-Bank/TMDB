Blige, Ronan Keating, Bryan Adams, Anastacia, Kiki Dee), and a set list of hits from every corner of his amazing career. What more could a fan ask for? Those in attendance still speak about these shows – this video is in fact a combination of two evenings at MSG – with great fondness and the surprise addition of The Beatles’ “Come Together”, a song Elton had never played live before, only adds to the concert’s fan status.
