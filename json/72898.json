In \"Anger,\" a domestic argument over a fly in the Sunday soup escalates into nuclear war. In \"Sloth,\" a movie star would rather pay someone to tie his shoe than bend over to do it himself, and he can't be bothered to accept a starlet's sexual favors. In \"Gluttony,\" a peasant family on its way to the funeral of a relative who died from indigestion stops regularly to eat and drink en route, arriving in time to eat some more. In \"Greed,\" a high-class prostitute refunds the price of a cadet's lottery ticket. In \"Pride,\" an unfaithful wife finds reason to reform. And so on through lust and envy.","popularity":4.683,"poster_path":"/rhU348zOhyu3FPTqnlli1FaU41B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Gibé","origin_country":""},{"id":1477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Franco London Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":641,"logo_path":"/w8flpSJntsxVCMkIU1qeg1kJcJh.png","name":"Titanus","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1962-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seven Deadly Sins","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":13}
