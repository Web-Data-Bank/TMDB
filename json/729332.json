Built in the 1740s by a farmer, it is a rare example of a middle class colonial dwelling. By some miracle, it has survived for over 270 years with an original roof in tact! The history that has unfolded in the house is connected to Arlington's history and to the history of the United States. From our agricultural past to the Ciivil War and expansion of the railroads, through World War One and Women's Suffrage, the house's inhabitants were a part of our shared history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oxcWCoS6v8pZXjDLRky396BDgBE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This house has more to do with arlington's history than you might think","title":"Document Historic Arlington: Ball-Sellers House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
