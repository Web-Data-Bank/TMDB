She has dreams of a park that are both premonitions of the future and a site at which its absence is played out. An escalating sense of timelessness collapses Aune's two realities, as her body takes on significance as a cipher for a larger process of dismemberment. A love story turns into a film about sex, death and the economy. Filmed in large part in Victoria Park, London, the film is a loose adaptation of 1896 novel Aune by Finnish writer Immi Hellen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aune, or On Effective Demise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
