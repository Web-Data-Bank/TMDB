He seeks another point of view, especially an end, and he relies on the reactions of the actors to invent a new resolution of his history, in a country suddenly raised by a wave of disputes. During the projection of the film, the debate takes place: what is the place of art creation in Algeria today? How to create something without confronting censorship? How to resist ? By making movies or walking in streets towards a new revolution? Two stories intertwine, fiction and reality? A new vision of the Algerian youth of today in full political and artistic questioning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rOIW1VYKWlS6qiTHHds6oYJfVQZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Normal!","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
