Although the two elders already have their everyday rituals for dealing with solitude, and the vicissitudes of old age, lately Teresa seems aloof, unhappy. To cheer her up, the old man prepares a celebration in their house, but he has a problem: almost all of their friends are dead. While Werner struggles to get everything ready, and Teresa gets dolled up, someone else is helping them with “the guests”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kBF0Bmja5p4Qh3tUvl4EfX9jIdI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2020-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los invitados","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
