By making the invisible visible, the work bears similarity and inspiration from the extensive quantum energy research at CERN which seeks to uncover and control the particles in and around us. In this era of over-production and over-algorithmic data illusion of choices, Toroid inserts itself in the digital narrative as a power source simulation showing a possibility for ensuring a positive flow of eternal (renewable) energy working in parallel with the natural order.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sXrGSYNylkxYah8o7qiY39DrlD4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toroid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
