The 2 folks in \"management\" are both into their own authority and fill their days creating wild &amp; stupid rules for the working folk. By mid-film, however, the manager has fled the cops after beating the crap out of a competing restaurant's dancing gyro... and the \"Chef\" has jumped ship to join a beatnik poet's groups which specializes in exotic menu-writing. This leaves the minimum-wage crowd to run the place as they see fit.... and they see a lot of debauchery, booze, and free steak in their future.","popularity":0.99,"poster_path":"/7Q6S0bWApvtMjHGoPIsXAll8f6h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los Enchiladas!","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":11}
