Sid was an obsessive Boston Terrier whose idea of bliss was to be swung around on a rubber pork chop. I was happy to accommodate him. Sid was shot with a 16mm Beaulieu camera which can be seen in shadow at one point in the film. Sid can also be heard barking mixed into Shay’s music. - Jeff Scher","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bQE8a2q6k7haannoCtqLyEocPTu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
