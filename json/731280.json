Grabbing material off someone else’s work was considered fair game and part of the fun, and contributed a kinetic dynamic to the ongoing display. Now the place is a park, and the sculptures are gone, but you can see what it used to be like in this neat and funny documentary by Ric Reynolds, augmented by Erich Seibert’s wonderful musique-concrète/time-lapse sequences. The flashback circus sequence includes Scott Beach and Bill Irwin. Sculptors interviewed include Walt Zucker, Tony Puccio, Robert Sommer, Ron & Mary Bradden, and Bob Kaminsky.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mudflat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
