Two years later she returns, but instead of being a teenager, she is a woman of about twenty-five years old. She doesn’t remember anything. When images resurface in her memory, Vera realizes that she has lived the life of a man, clinically dead, who woke up at the same moment in which she vanished in nothing.","popularity":0.79,"poster_path":"/lwOxffyu95rkSLgnRO0Fme6wYat.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31370,"logo_path":null,"name":"Macaia Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":132911,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atómica Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In an universe this big no one truly disappears","title":"Vera De Verdad","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
