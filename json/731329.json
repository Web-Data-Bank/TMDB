The black rock of the earth stands in sharp contrast to the billowing vapor that hovers and drifts above the surface. A narrator describes how the island’s first inhabitants sought to explain the violent eruption by attributing the devastation to the wrath of angry gods. With breathtaking black-and-white cinematography, this poetic exploration considers the human relationship to this volatile land, where residents live alongside the looming threat of eruption with reverence, fear, and awe. A collection of scenes where dark and light miraculously coexist illuminates both the physical and spiritual landscapes of this extraordinary place, where life endures the perils of the natural world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5CgXiODe7CvXrrAoILXTK6FfNkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138351,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Vol d'Oiseau","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":111463,"logo_path":null,"name":"DocNomads","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-08-05","revenue":10000,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirits and Rocks: An Azorean Myth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
