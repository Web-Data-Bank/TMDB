In most people's lives, work operates as a degrading and debilitating force. It disables people's critical and perception capacities. Unless workers assume responsibility for evaluating the meaning and implications of the work they do, there will never be the capacity to redirect the modern work institutions from their courses of violence and exploitation.  Built in seven parts which correspond to each day of the week, this film studies the relationship between work being done and the nature of the people that are doing it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sl4prWNjKYO9MwsdSkL30VbqxzX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Day's Work","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
