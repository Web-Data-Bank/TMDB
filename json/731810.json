Trapped in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, this group of nearly 80 settlers fell prey to sub-zero temperatures, torrential rainfalls, extreme heat, and ten-foot snow drifts. Punishing storms trapped the party with nearly no food or shelter for 5 months in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Many died, some succumbed to cannibalism to survive, and others delved deeply into their faith while waiting to be rescued. “The Donner Party” explores this exciting journey through a hybrid of first-person narration, remarkable reenactments, expert interviews, CGI, and archival materials.","popularity":1.096,"poster_path":"/1wF0jKZapv4b3gRkwQrMr8JYHyL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30584,"logo_path":"/7s0nJTTztkOVeIgavfOwx36EBtj.png","name":"Thinkfactory Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How far would you go to keep your family safe?","title":"Dead of Winter: The Donner Party","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
