In the short documentary, we witness Anly Peñamante and Norming Astubesa, who are both Dumagat, sharing their thoughts on the dam construction after coming from a meeting with other community members. On the background, we are taken into the slow and simple life in the mountains, where Dumagats live peacefully. However, there is fear and uncertainty that comes from the pronouncements of President Rodrigo Duterte, who is determined to push for the construction of the Kaliwa Dam no matter what the cost.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tC6iUE7rj1LpjcKQCHjkjN993Cr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whispers from the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
