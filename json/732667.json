At each point where the two artists paused, a short sound performance was created. The performer runs tirelessly with a horn honking through the different landscapes of the Andes. Through this experience not only the different places are shown, but at the same time an acoustic scanning of the respective places is created.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/K3MU5nD353fHB46WdgbokHSsHC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2019-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Persistent Disturbance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
