Using a bank of images taken on her camera phone over the past five years, Taal's work speaks to feelings of being at capacity, and of fatigue and frustration. ‘Dump’ is a word that imitates a sound, as well as a form of back-up after a system failure, something that Taal identifies through her work as a ‘catalogue of what could be lost.'
