The film follows two of its musicians: Tsepo Pooe, who grew up in Soweto Township; and Lize Schaap, who grew up in wealthy Pretoria. Through their eyes, and differing experiences of growing up in South Africa, we understand the enormous impact apartheid continues to have, but also see hope for a brighter future for the country. The Miagi Orchestraâ€™s mission is inspired by the work and legacy of Nelson Mandela, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qlNduWpU1OS7WfatObcqcJogWJj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49822,"logo_path":"/3ona9SNUU97BeiP10g1Lv7kP9HM.png","name":"Grain Media","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":118854,"logo_path":"/g9LPNlQFoDcHjfnvrEqFmeIaDrZ.png","name":"Rideback","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can music heal a nation?","title":"An Unfinished Symphony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
