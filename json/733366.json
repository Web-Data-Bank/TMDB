Instead of taking the Interstate, they both agree for the longer but more scenic coastal highway, exploring and developing a companionship. Upon reaching San Francisco later that evening, the two decide to divorce destination from conclusion and get back in their car to find out just how far the Pacific Coast Highway will take them.
