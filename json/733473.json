In this poem she uses the metaphor of war for a lover’s quarrel. My intention with the film is to amplify the emotional tone of the words, through repetition and staccato editing of image and sound in an attempt to convey the physical discomfort of being in an argument without winners, only losers. The source material for the image is an outdoor performance of the Quebec Circus, a comment on the overly dramatic lyrics of the poem, with the final smoke-filled image referencing a battlefield.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rVrkvO0CZIIZfNJHGt6zqcqpS7w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Losing Battle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
