Upon returning to the States the Colonel would be court-martialed and made a plea agreement wherein all the blame is on him and his men would be discharged and receive any benefits they're entitled. But the General presiding over his trial chooses not to agree to the agreement and throws the book at the Colonel and has his men dishonorably discharged thus eliminating all their benefits.","popularity":2.914,"poster_path":"/5AZAIVhkhYkkcOxHe3T82BCBu9F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phoenician Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lock Down at 30,000 Feet","title":"Air Rage","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":8}
