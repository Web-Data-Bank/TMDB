The musical highlights are many: ‘Winterstürme’, Siegmund’s hymn of praise to the coming of spring and the awakening of love; the Ride of the Valkyries; the Magic Fire music. Above all, there is the great confrontation between the god Wotan and his favourite daughter, Brünnhilde – the Valkyrie of the title – who love each other deeply, yet whose relationship has been irreparably broken by her disobedience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ApZ63hZASDvNKJ3fJoI0rOtAS8v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wagner: Die Walküre - Opera North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
