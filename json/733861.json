Concentrating on the expression of bodies in movement, the piece frames cultural manifestations historically linked to anti-colonial resistance alongside contemporary trends aligned with a consumer-based industry embraced by emerging economies today. The registered dance sessions involve individuals and groups that perform in a staged event at \"Le Casino\", a cinema and theatre hall built in the 30's that also served for meetings of the worker's union of the city's port.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/33b62TH0iC4wDJalRoPb3gVjIhq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinéma Casino","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
