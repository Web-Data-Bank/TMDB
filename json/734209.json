The environment recorded on video is characteristic of a concoction of preplanned hillocks that are cut across by canals and ponds which are linked by curved footbridges. Terziev highlights the architectural ensemble characteristic of prop-like tanks, rockets, military airplanes and canons—all arranged as if on a battlefield. The metal items painted in the same colors—yellow, red and blue—were manufactured from the materials used in the production of military equipment. Importantly, the film turns to the environment as metaphor, as it documents everyday activities in a space packed with residents who are unaware of the changing ideologies behind their urban surroundings, as communist ideology gradually gives way to capitalist consumerism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/58JSZOXeOwWTcAiMqIKGOZe3769.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Place (Playground)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
