It’s terrific background material, especially the music disc with the favorite characters both human and muppet. Plus some of my nostalgic favorites — it helps if you once had a baby or toddler in your lap, clapping along with you for these things. I can’t think of a better way to honor the show, and am ready for a followup, with more favorite segments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ac5WA1N2MikJj8xIlb53LKQFWys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":350,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sesame Street: 50 Years and Counting","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
