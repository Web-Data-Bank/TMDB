A book without a cover. You don't know the title nor the author. Tear out a page. Look at it, read it. Thread up a super-8 cartridge. Film these 3 minutes. Look for shots. Those that are to be found in the text and those that are not there. Those in front of you that bring out the words that still have a hold over you. Text fragment read and treated by Philippe Vernier.\" —Dominik Lange","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ponTycubJudtBWryXKhOxW0Qf64.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zombi-Jardin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
