Like Beached it was also shot in a marshy area near the sea and in sequences that are separated by dissolves. One sees five different actions that are related to BROKEN OFF. The artist breaks a tree branch, scrapes and kicks the ground with his foot, snaps a stick in two off a fence, scrapes a stone with his fingernail. At the end he pulls the line plug from the video.\" â€” Alice Weiner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Off","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
