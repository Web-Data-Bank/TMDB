This documentary follows the personal story of Igor, then a nineteen-year-old citizen of Belgrade who was recruited and sent to compulsory military service in the barracks in Varaždin, recorded by the camera of a family friend and video enthusiast Predrag Bata Milošević. A few months later, Igor returns from war twice as old and with scars that will probably never be healed.
