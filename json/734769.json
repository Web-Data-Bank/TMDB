Through a vivid and surreal landscape, each person encounters a series of distinct individuals and slowly rediscovers a larger collective body. Terrain is a dancing unison of difference. Our bodies bridge gaps between worlds, and with this we invent a new kind of non-verbal truth. This new interconnectedness propels us back to life again, essentialized by our shared sense of interbeing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ZBaISTmYF07wt0LhF6s1SjieGT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
