The author's approach to his twelve-year-old self is articulated through a mosaic of vacation videos found in an old family camera. These memories form a touching, nostalgic, self-parody warp, the digital remnants of a new generational sensibility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8NTVKyC65z4gawwC5PxTjJrJGpS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2006 the only year that i remember","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
