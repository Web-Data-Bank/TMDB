I didn’t remember the song, but for the film I selected Plaisir d’Amour by Jean Paul Égide Martini. The film soon became a series of other dream ideas as well. I wanted every scene in the film to be a tracking shot, moving from right to left like a dream scroll. I wanted the film to be quiet and contemplative, and I didn’t want to use subtitles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iX8DXTwlwKN4xsiLI6gWalRQ1V6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moving Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
