A hippie couple is standing on a corner waiting for Burt. He shows up driving a battered station wagon. Cleo (Cindy Hopkins, aka Suzanne Fields) only has half the money, so Burt suggests that they work something out. They go back to Burt's pad and he suggests a trade: pussy for that work. \"I hope that you're worth $20, baby.\" She bitches when he gets tough. \"You broads are all alike,\" he says. \"You like to get kicked around so you can go home with a clear conscience after giving up some pussy.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spaced Out","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
