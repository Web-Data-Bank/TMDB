This year she's invited a group of old friends who broke up six years ago after infidelity shattered their friendships, in hopes of letting bygones be bygones. It's not exactly The Big Chill, but still quite upbeat for porn.  Hyapatia's Native American-inspired glamorous costumes are a highlight, as well as the usual sex performed by some of the biggest names in the business. Only \"unknown\" is a beautiful ditzy blonde (in sort of a Goldie Hawn) role billed as Jerry Sinclaire, who turns out to be Barbie Doll, later a popular actress if not a legend like her co-stars here.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4uUicL06nFLBx1fzv8z3PHHiKkr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Essex Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wild, Wild West","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
