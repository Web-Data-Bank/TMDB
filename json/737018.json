The name \"Hyeon-soo\" that comes across the phone reminds me of \"Hyepn-soo,\" who left the company after a fight. A middle-aged woman approaches Mi-Joo, who returned home struggling with her injured ankle. \"I'm Hyun-soo's mom.\"  Hyeon-soo, who lives with Mi-Joo, leaves home after a quarrel. He visits a bank to check the piling credit card debts and while writing his resume at a computer shop, he discovers his parents’ growing age. Hyeon-soo, who visited the university club again, recalls the days when he first met Mi-joo and began to love her after discovering her short film. Just in time, Hyeon-soo bumps into his young juniors and offers to shoot something with a camcorder.
