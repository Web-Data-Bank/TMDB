The mystic-folkie ethos that has long been her caricature are well showcased via the cult fave Rumours outtake/B-side \"Silver Spring,\" the muscular Sheryl Crow collaboration \"Sorcerer,\" and a live version of the moody \"Rhiannon\" that casts it in even longer shadows. Yet Stevie Nicks has always displayed a willingness to push herself beyond her hippie muse, as witnessed by the dense aura of Deep Dish's remix of Mac's \"Dreams\" and such disparate, pop-savvy solo highlights as \"I Can't Wait,\" \"Stand Back,\" and shrewd, successful duets with Tom Petty (\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\") and Don Henley (\"Leather and Lace\").","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AlYYTttKjPBuJzy0uhCNDzXGuc8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crystal Visions: The Very Best of Stevie Nicks","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
