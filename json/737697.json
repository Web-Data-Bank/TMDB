Through her eyes we follow the daily reality of the girls in this orchestra. Although the situation in Afghanistan is improving, playing music is still unacceptable in the eyes of many, especially when it comes to young women. The film directed by Lucia Kašová depicts their desires, dreams and preparation for performances. During the tour in Slovakia, when they get to the former borders of the communist bloc, the symbolism of the Iron Curtain moves the Afghan story to a completely different perspective.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sSbHg3TZuOJotLOCSZZrOC1iTcm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakazulu films","origin_country":""},{"id":139305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pohoda Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2020-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orchestra from the Land of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
