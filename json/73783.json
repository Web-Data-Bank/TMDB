It homes in on the daily life of a father with a daughter whose hands and feet are deformed. “Animal Farm” relies on the rough-and-ready feel of stop-motion clay animation to create a satire of bullying and mob dynamics. “At Her House” paints a devastating picture of gender inequality within a marriage. “Flesh and Bone” gently pillories superficiality and the obsession with outward appearance. “Bicycle Trip” focuses on the discrimination experienced by foreign workers in Korea. “Be a Human Being” looks at the way young Koreans are barely treated as human beings before they get to university.","popularity":0.679,"poster_path":"/xiNrPUYe3SLddM2gCtKInFzmJET.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chungeorahm Film","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":112448,"logo_path":"/i2Buhtxe5wshqAtRn7MpF38LEyt.png","name":"National Human Rights Commission of Korea","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2005-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If You Were Me: Anima Vision","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
