The 1955 song 'Muistatko Monrepos’n’ was the first Finnish record to go gold and is still the fourth best selling single in Finland. The location it refers to occupies a specific place in Finnish cultural memory, as somewhere that was ‘lost’, and as such the waltz is highly loaded. What meaning remains, when the music is stripped away? At present, the nostalgic is not a neutral territory, it can be hard to separate weaponised nostalgia from its more well-intended forms. When its affective qualities are combined with notions of national identity, a potentially difficult space opens up. Muistatko (a method) is about trying to feel the weight of this context, from the outside.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qIVvtZptgA029YRh3dEJSReTYzg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muistatko (a method)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
