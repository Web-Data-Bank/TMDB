It's now considered a classic of Australian cinema. At the film's centre was a 13-year-old boy, Tom Allen, torn between his calling and his sexuality. This series picks up the story 35 years later. It is 1988 and Tom is now in his forties. A practising Catholic and respected Sydney psychiatrist, Tom accepts an offer from the Bishop of Sydney to become a secular confessor to the Catholic clergy, and is soon embroiled in political and theological intrigue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c0LVEBTLaX2IST3r469o3g3WPrx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":270,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devil's Playground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
