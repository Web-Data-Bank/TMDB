In just a few years, he completed five operas, including Iris, premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome in 1898. Mascagni might well have taken for his own Puccini's famous quip, “Against everything and everyone, make a work from melody”. And in Iris it is melodic invention which shows the composer's genius at its greatest. A melody by Mascagni is usually long, smooth and Italian-sounding; and Iris is full-on melody all the way, particularly in such crowd-pleasers as Jor's Serenade, the “Hymn of the Sun” or the duet in Act II “Oh come al tuo sottile corpo s'aggira”, which includes the famous “Piovra”. Furtheremore, with a little effort listeners can identify what would be the various musical “numbers”. In Iris, Mascagni is almost obsessively attentive to recitative and his exemplary flexibility at times recalls the sublime \"conversation style\" \"invented\" by Puccini.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8BfGulhkLoEOQe38eiiPIGhLvGQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Recorded Live at the Teatro Goldoni, Livorno, 2017","title":"Iris","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
