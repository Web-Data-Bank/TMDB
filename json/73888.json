More than 1,000 of them are war criminals convicted at the 1946–48 Tokyo tribunal, including 14 Class-A war criminals, Hideki Tōjō among them. The film shows not only the widely reported political incidents associated with the shrine, but also takes an in-depth look at the shrine's sword-making tradition, the Yasukuni sword being the film's underlying motif.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":"/oFPDW17YI9zRj60tYkH1PsU9Qse.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing Youth Film Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":96981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dragon Films","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yasukuni","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
