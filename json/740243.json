All four are working class, multicultural and internationally oriented, and have been influenced significantly by urban planning and nineteenth-century and modernist urges to demolish. They share a clich√©d sense of inferiority and often top 'the wrong charts'. They are currently undergoing an international re-evaluation, including ongoing processes of gentrification. Their shared characteristics could form the basis for a gang of cities capable of taking on the world. Or even showing the world how it could be done.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lh9RpSfhOoyG908QhJRRJPaMTre.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139674,"logo_path":null,"name":"StudioRev","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Four Harbour cities.
