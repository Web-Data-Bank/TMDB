He's convinced that the place for his schizophrenic mother is at home with her loved ones, not in an institution. While on an unannounced visit, he kidnaps his mother to take her home with him once and for all – but Alejandro is soon overwhelmed by his mother's mental incapacities as they embark on a journey of love and commitment, of emotional and physical extremes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pSHgpiIa0ek8P92OpMHtHwu2PXw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13450,"logo_path":null,"name":"ANTORCHA FILMS","origin_country":""},{"id":13449,"logo_path":"/jVqRkSBiksaZ1Qz4Y73dIbrlNkV.png","name":"PUCARÁ cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2022-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
