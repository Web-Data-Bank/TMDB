Imagine what would happen if a spectator were to enter inside that dark device? This is exactly what is staged in this video. Unexpected things happen, a \"miraculous\" meeting between Ana and Ahmad. The girl from 'Where is the spirit?' She is a spectator who is not only in front of the Kiarostami film, but materially within it, she is an intruder who bursts into the action. and somehow the death of a traditional type of spectator is enunciated, one who seeks empathy with the protagonists. It seems that empathy with fictional characters is no longer possible, this new viewer is situated in a different place, demands new projection spaces and, of course, other types of forms. \" - Celeste Araújo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9SfOybOEkJ7t3I19ynmSOIu980s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"¿Dónde está el espíritu?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
