Nathan is by definition a solo, but it's also a pas de deux between dancer and camera. A young man in casual business attire enters a nondescript hotel room. Immediately he begins a series of improvisatory dance phrases, partnering with chairs, lamps, bed. Repeated attempts at graceful, balletic poses often end in crashes to the floor, broken chairs, and twisted bed sheets.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ltNqCWqJhf9gEJyNhpxPn9JUasp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nathan (Hotel Room CT)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
