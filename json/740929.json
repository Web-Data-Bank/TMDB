In the United States, 700,000 homosexuals have already undergone so-called conversion therapy. These therapies, which go by name only, promise to \"fix\" a deviant sexual orientation. Led by religious or pseudo-scientific communities, they do not hesitate to use humiliation and physical violence to achieve their ends and to change a person's inner identity. Conceived as a road movie, stretching from Alabama to California, this documentary immerses us in the world of conversion therapy, with powerful testimonies from victims and activists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A2usz1F6BoFxM1N6Mt0X1cbKP4Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139786,"logo_path":"/mVy9zeEEW9f2Sj4wM4iuGnEfsLi.png","name":"Tohubohu","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":123176,"logo_path":"/1xfVfLus4m7J7LkbuPM4yPy4Aqp.png","name":"Falabracks","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tu deviendras hétéro, mon fils","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
