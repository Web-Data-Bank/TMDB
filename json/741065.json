Originally set during Sicily's 13th-century uprising against French rule, in Christof Loy's staging for the Netherlands Opera the action is transposed to a 1940s world of sudden violence and shadowy double-dealing. Imaginatively cast and idiomatically conducted, the performance presents this magnificent score in its entirety, including the allegorical ballet The Four Seasons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zstS0qFrWTr6SlM7RG7sEDezj9z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":232,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giuseppe Verdi: Les vêpres siciliennes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
