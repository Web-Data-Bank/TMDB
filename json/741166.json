On their joint adventure, filmmaker Matthew Boman aka dadass and Elmer unintentionally peel back the enforced \"good vibes only\" rhetoric about Burning Man and tread into violent backlash from the event's organizers. Both men share in struggles and questions over freedom, happiness and the legality of living and working in modern-day America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nA8oz7KjChYHjRqRLxtAdCfdp5r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blurring Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
