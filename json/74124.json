This documentary is set in the New Marilyn night club in Tokyo, Japan - where the hosts are transgender men. They can only make their living as hosts in a nightclub with other wannabes like them. The young women who come there often have relationships with them but the underlying fear is whether such a relationship can withstand the pressures on a girl to get married and have children. All three boys deal with this in different ways. These three hosts, the Shinjuku Boys, take us into their lives.","popularity":0.615,"poster_path":"/iF3Iar67B5troXAc8SEXhV8SBSM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177462,"logo_path":null,"name":"20th Century Vixen","origin_country":""},{"id":82784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vixen Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shinjuku Boys","video":false,"vote_average":6.556,"vote_count":9}
