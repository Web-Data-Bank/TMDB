He plays the eponymous Krapp, a sad, lonely man recollecting emotion in tranquility with the assistance of a reel to reel tape recorder.  Now somewhere near 70, he is reminded of the past, as a recording of his 39-year-old self recalls life a dozen years before. As such, we are able to glimpse the hope of relative youth, the acceptance of middle age failure and the resignation of an old man.  The Old Tune:  It features two old men sitting on a park bench next to a hurdy-gurdy and almost inevitably brings to mind the song from Gigi, “I Remember It Well”.  As cars pass, irritating the men who fondly remember the days of horse-drawn carriages, every statement delivered by either Niall Buggy or David Threlfall, playing the grumpy septuagenarians, is instantly contradicted by his fellow, often to great humorous effect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/M13Be3Rk3PuWtUxSwlM8fzNp8S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139897,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jermyn Street Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beckett Double Bill (Krapp's Last Tape / The Old Tune)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
