The pandemic has shown how fast and how far we can move when faced with a global threat. The film asks the simple question: if the science is right on climate change, what should you do?  Facing up to crisis, transforming yourself by overcoming a seemingly insurmountable threat, is THE archetypal story of human civilisation.  But this time the threat is global and may prove fatal.  Now that we understand more about what a ‘global crisis’ feels like, it can no longer be ignored. This is our opportunity to live life without lies, a life that offers both resilience and joy through the power of collective action.  thetroublemakermovie.com","popularity":0.608,"poster_path":"/tfOSJsb0zwaPwdOqJQdyVtDszSr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In times of crisis we get to find out who we really are.","title":"The Troublemaker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
