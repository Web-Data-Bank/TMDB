What is it about the present that makes us unwilling to let the past go? Among the Igbo-speaking people of eastern Nigeria there exists a word: “Echezona,” which simply means “never forget.” There is the possibility of a deeper meaning – the way it is used in these films: it is taboo to forget.\r Using appropriated archival film footage layered with personal text, the film takes as its point of departure the old idea that the personal is political – in the sense that collective forgetting is a politically sponsored act.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory Also Die","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
