The film is divided into three sections--game, conflict and flirtation--that repeat themselves without seeming to do so. This illusion is created by the sound track, which varies and colours the action. A film without words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/famdSDZAxKoIjmyqUjDl380ahFD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Listen, You'll See...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
