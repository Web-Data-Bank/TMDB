They are two strangers for whom the process of creation awakens intimacy that touches their very being. For the artist it is the need to go beyond appearances; for the model it is the refusal to look at the self. From scene to scene the film progresses, transforms, reconstructs the human interior landscape. A dramatic confrontation ensues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oRMCvEWHMoD2MyhAmfdP3f06fpj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Studio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
