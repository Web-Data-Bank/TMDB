It grew out of an unusual process of interchange between the painter Jean Detheux and the composer Jean Derome. The result is a rare meeting of images and music. What we get is an intense meditation on a world in constant renewal, where every form that emerges is immediately engulfed by the next one. It constitutes a sort of diptych with the film Rupture, which follows. A film without words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jgNuV7RuVMcXA5DdnN3DuU6DfHg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liaisons","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
