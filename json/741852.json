This year, the music industry has been hit hard following the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected the entire globe. While concerts are starting to pick up, the life and shows we remember that took place just over six months ago remain uncertain. Bands had to think quickly and reinvent the wheel to connect with their fans. We’ve watched artists perform in their pajamas, bands have streamed a set from their rehearsal space, and others have taken to Twitch, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook to have live Q&A sessions. Metallica have also stepped up to the table to bring over twenty consecutive weeks of their series. However, Behemoth’s Absentia Dei livestream spectacular took place on September 5th from a secret church location in Poland.","popularity":0.724,"poster_path":"/lr5JFJAzUZIYzmXWrAwZ4uoyr5Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140488,"logo_path":null,"name":"G13 Production House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2020-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behemoth - In Absentia Dei","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2}
