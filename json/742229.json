Her best friend, Gin Gin, is an ultra-femme bleached blonde go-go dancer. Gin discovers she’s pregnant while her boyfriend is ghosting her. Since he’s also in Guangzhou, Micky and Gin Gin decide to head out on the road together. After their luggage is stolen, they’re taken in by a stranger and introduced to a glitzy, bizarrely otherworldly urban metropolis, and their road trip takes several strange and frightening turns.","popularity":0.67,"poster_path":"/qy4Jx2g4ri8DfEDxcdKXbn2A5L4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169598,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaohsiung Film Fund","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2020-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mickey on the Road","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
