Tracking their parallel lives in New York and Havana, their poignant reunion, and their momentous first performances together, Los Hermanos/The Brothers suggests what is possible when walls come down, and borders are crossed. A nuanced, intensely moving view of nations long estranged, through the lens of music and family. Featuring an electrifying, genre-bending score composed by Cuban Aldo López-Gavilán, performed with his American brother, Ilmar, with a guest appearance by violin maestro Joshua Bell and the Harlem Quartet.","popularity":1.115,"poster_path":"/bhCeJ3tuSlOOYuslPgqabYk8BlN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":162293,"logo_path":null,"name":"PatchWorks Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Divided by politics.
