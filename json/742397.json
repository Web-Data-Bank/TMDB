We join two women who meet and interact, sometimes oblivious to and sometimes hyper-aware of their surroundings. Twitch sets this intimate relationship against the backdrop of a big city sky, through a boiler room, down a wooden stairway, and out onto the street. Twitch is playful and poignant. Inventive camerwork, an innovative soundtrack and intrepid choreography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Q8AEihA4BmVvvWFqHWBvLJYjRN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twitch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
