Following the footsteps of Céline - a local foreigner who has lived in Portugal for 20 years - we are introduced to Ivone Días and Marta Miranda, two female singers from different generations who fight for the survival of their art and their community. Their common language is Fado, a traditional style of music that talks about the daily struggle of living. With the lyrics of fado songs taking us through the story, the film explores the relationship between fado singers and the ever-changing world around them.","popularity":0.664,"poster_path":"/xHfqBDwXlQCc0e3f01micD9YonL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charneca Bubble","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silence - Voices of Lisbon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
