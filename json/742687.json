And humor is the sharpest weapon of the desperate. That is why it is an obligation, indeed a must, to enjoy this Figaro by Jürgen Flimm at the Staatsoper to the fullest.“ (ARD Radio) This production of “Le nozze di Figaro” is directed by the former artistic director of the Staatsoper Berlin, Jürgen Flimm, who characterizes it as follows: “Figaro is by far the best work ever devised for the stage; it combines everything that moves the human heart and mind – forlorn hope, pleasantry, satire, profound significance, also much ado about nothing and vain amours.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sNgbViCIBK0alpHd4n5Cwlz2tzp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MOZART: LE NOZZE DI FIGARO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
