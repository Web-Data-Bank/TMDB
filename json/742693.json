Premiered just months before Mozarts death, Die Zauberflöte in many ways represents a new departure for the composer. Catching the spirit of revolution in the air, Mozart turned his attention for the first time from court opera to popular opera, writing this singspiel (sung-play) for a new and much broader audience. Celebrated Canadian directing duo Barbe & Doucet make both their British and Glyndebourne debuts here with their new Die Zauberflöte, a veritable theatrical feast of eccentricity. (The Guardian). Ryan Wigglesworth conducts an outstanding cast including Russian soprano Sofia Fomina as Pamina, David Portillo as her beloved Tamino, Brindley Sherratt as Sarastro, and the ebullient Björn Bürger as Papageno.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q5TYUEuVra08MMlv8lerjK07GoK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Flute from Glyndebourne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
