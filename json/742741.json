The teacher gives him an F on the test without saying anything. In the meantime, on one side of the classroom, Juyeon looks happy, watching Songju rap. He loves hip-hop as much as Songju does although these two come from completely different backgrounds. Songju is a troubled student living in a multi-house home in a less developed area while Juyeon is an exemplary student living in a fancy apartment in a rich village. Despite differences in grade, personality, and background, they decide to form a hip-hop duo called LIMECRIME.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8RZyZlvmyLjsPjb3q0QcXQU79hb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giraffe Slide","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LIMECRIME","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
