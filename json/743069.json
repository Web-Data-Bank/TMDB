The last in their village still attending school, they are determined to pass their knowledge on, holding classes for other Aka children every afternoon. But their project requires funding and they are counting on the year’s caterpillar (known as “Makongo”) harvest to provide much needed income. Evocatively capturing the visual and sonic textures of the forest, Makongo is a layered ethnographic study of two men working to build a sustainable future for their community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CF","name":"Central African Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sango","iso_639_1":"sg","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caterpillars","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1}
