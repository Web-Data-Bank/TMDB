We don't know exactly how he makes his money but we know it's probably not very nice. Mr Karva's stepson, Othello, has ambitions to take the old man's place; and Othello's fainthearted friend, Emilio, has ambitions of his own. This delicate balance of power is upset when Roadrunner finds a strange, sickly-looking 10 year old boy in the park. All his life, Roadrunner has been on the move - but when he looks into the child's eyes, he finds he can finally stop running. It becomes clear that the child can grant each character their own taste of heaven - the 'perfect, rosy future of your dreams'. The child never talks but transforms the world around him, working on the desire in each character's heart, whatever it may be.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/fkWhR0SOsg4XYBZqQDGLP8WII3l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lives of the Saints","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":6}
