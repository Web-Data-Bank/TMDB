Filmed at The Mean Fiddler in front of a packed house, the concert is perhaps not as theatrical as the Subterranea tour, although vocalist Peter Nicholls dons makeup and a cape for the event, just like in the old days of IQ. However, the main focus of the gig is the band itself and what immediately struck me was the important role that humor plays here, which has been absent from their other concert films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vKpnInWXuChIBKun3tMu4SMzgCE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IQ - The Twenty Anniversary Show","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
