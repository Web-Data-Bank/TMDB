One morning, while shaving his beard, the postman buzzes at the intercom to tell him he has a package. Gabriele opens the door and, before greeting him, runs to rinse his face. In that short space of time, a ten-year-old child slips into his apartment and hides away. “The maestro” – as he’s called in his neighbourhood – only notices the stowaway late at night. And when he sees him, he recognises the intruder as Ciro, a child who lives with his parents and siblings on the top floor of his building. When asked why he has fled his home, Ciro refuses to speak. Nevertheless, the maestro instinctively decides to hide him in his home, setting Ciro’s enemies a uniquely difficult challenge.","popularity":3.164,"poster_path":"/7bOVuU1xyWGh6IYQkZEgrkYF4Ur.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6275,"logo_path":"/ynsdOyF03HZvEeZreVrDLc3OPEc.png","name":"BiBi Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":105864,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Commission Regione Campania","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hidden Child","video":false,"vote_average":6.605,"vote_count":43}
