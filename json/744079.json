We visited necro-realist film-maker Yevgeny Yufit at his house beside Lake Seliger, helping him repair the house we stayed in and, in exchange, being lavished with the fresh fish that landed in his nets every day. This film is a tribute to Yufit, who died in St. Petersburg in 2016.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/759I2ZPeY0EDr9Emv6wWNpB1DId.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riba","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
