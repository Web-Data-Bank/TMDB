During the speech, he also announced his resignation. For many, Nasser’s speech was the first hint of the full scope of the loss and the disillusionment with the pan-Arab vision he had led. The film weaves numerous stylistically divergent excerpts together, extracted from Egyptian movies and television series produced between 1976 and 2016; the found footage excerpts were edited to reconstruct Nasser’s speech of resignation according to the original text by using elements appropriated from popular culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3WFPRIpn6525qw8f7PMAWq9xTmk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2019-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Osiris","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
