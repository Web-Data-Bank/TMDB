Wherever he looks, he feels surrounded by images and places that have a political significance. Can a landscape be free of meaning, is there any point in striving for an approach that transcends all ideology?  Commissioned by the ARTE network as part of a series of films for the end of the millennium, this film is a travelogue through Jerusalem, Nazareth and Ramallah. The film is a meditation on quotidian injustices, and a formulation of an aesthetic and creative response to them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zTYmiztxOMWieWxOVt7G1SrNRxi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arab Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
