The dominant old building of the National Library in the centre of Athens, with its neoclassical style pillars, tries to remind us of the Golden Age of Pericles and the sages of ancient Greece. But few of the residents seem to be interested in it. The preparations for the transfer of the books, ‘victims’ of looting and wear, have begun. In a city that looks like a battlefield we witness both the transfer and the city, which in its unrest remains exciting. And also, we get to hear the voice of the National Library, connecting the past with the present, wondering about the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8N9Bo6RB8p0PvwkxeKoR99jKLXw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transfer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
