Director Lee Soojung calls her ‘sister J’. 10 years into the fight for reinstatement, Jaechun now writes, plays guitar, and sings while living in a tent. She says her personality has changed after 7 years of being laid-off from “originally timid” to being very lively. Sister J deals with a struggle for reinstatement, but it is actually a film about a single person, as stated in the title. This documentary brings artistic vitality to the ‘4,464 days’ Sister J spends on the site, with lines and music driven from the forms of the play into the cinema.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/ssl6PUWg3exfXBlNuF9vd4Uz9tf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53366,"logo_path":"/5fbWZ4BsG9gh50cay7lOj5aKguu.png","name":"Cinema Dal","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":150525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitte des Lebens","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sister J","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
