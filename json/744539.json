The all-star cast includes Jennifer Aniston, Dane Cook, Morgan Freeman, Jimmy Kimmel, Shia LaBeouf, John Legend, Ray Liotta, CORE co-founder Sean Penn, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts.  This virtual special featured a series of memorable moments, including LaBeouf's hilariously accurate portrayal of Jeff Spicoli enjoyed by Penn himself, Morgan Freeman's dramatic narration, Julia Roberts (Stacy Hamilton) and Aniston's (Linda Barrett) adorable friendship, and a comical reenactment between Aniston (Linda) and Pitt (Brad Hamilton) as their characters shared a flirtatious scene in a daydream sequence.  This event benefited COREâ€™s COVID-19 relief efforts to protect vulnerable communities as well as our friends at Reform Alliance.","popularity":2.503,"poster_path":"/92QLyEbstJeGyDDz67c80NO9uWa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A Virtual Table Read","video":true,"vote_average":5.333,"vote_count":12}
