When a mutual friend delivered Sherman to the McDougall’s farm, the donkey was on death’s door: He had infected sores all over his bloated body and hooves grown as long and curled as witch’s nails.  The McDougalls taught Sherman how to be a donkey again, how to run, and then how to race. The story culminates in Sherman competing with his human and donkey buddies in a race in the Rockies that’s both grueling and hysterical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Running With Sherman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
