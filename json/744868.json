In a world where most people deify and have blind faith in Manxin, Seonho and Garam, who have their own pain and secrets, search for its developer. Contrary to their expectations, they discover the true nature of Manxin. Manxin questions life and the essence of humankind through people who are, ironically, obsessed with the black arts rather than science, and others, who refuse the given path, anxiously seek the truth in a time of advanced AI, which accurately predicts the future to a large extent. Although we don’t know where our time is leading, isn’t it possible for human beings to live out their given time in blissful ignorance?","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/yaTYk7Z2vfsJewg6ofpPexsv0jG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96988,"logo_path":"/akinMWSzcOArgVt7xJPdy7AOl1d.png","name":"Soo Film","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":26511,"logo_path":"/muK9W0KLV8KfEnR7MYu0YpfpdnO.png","name":"MBC","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":129416,"logo_path":"/ynjFzjybVSnYd26oYQ1VKWpc7gE.png","name":"Directors Guild of Korea","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manxin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
