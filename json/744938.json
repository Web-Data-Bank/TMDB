Since no one should be alone on Christmas, Natalie decides to make the opening happen any way she can. However, the attractive but pessimistic Chef Stefano (Gilles Marini) believes it’s impossible – there are only three days until Christmas! But Natalie insists that problems are just opportunities in disguise and soon she convinces Stefano that they can do it. At first, these opposites do not attract, but feelings begin to change when they find themselves working side-by-side. With Stefano’s help Natalie learns that cooking, like Christmas, isn’t about perfection…it’s about sharing it with the ones you love.","popularity":5.24,"poster_path":"/8tvmXaUVWppzMPMJ0m4ue4I0LUT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109014,"logo_path":"/vm7S29lX7zNSM4DxTeduJCtAUxa.png","name":"Sunshine Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Taste of Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":5.818,"vote_count":11}
