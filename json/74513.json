War correspondent Elsa Casanova is taken hostage by the Taliban. Faced with her imminent execution, a Special Forces unit is dispatched to free her. In some of the world’s most breathtaking yet hostile landscapes, a relentless pursuit begins between her kidnappers who have no intention of letting their prey escape them and a group of soldiers who risk their lives in pursuit of their single aim – to bring her home alive. This strong, independent woman and these men of duty are thrown together and forced to confront situations of great danger that inextricably bind them – emotionally, violently and intimately.","popularity":25.828,"poster_path":"/xpe9F3214mNrk8tnIqZvHSmIV1I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofica Manon","origin_country":""},{"id":24457,"logo_path":null,"name":"Easy Company","origin_country":""},{"id":694,"logo_path":"/5LEHONGkZBIoWvp1ygHOF8iyi1M.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6586,"logo_path":null,"name":"TPS Star","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":24458,"logo_path":"/AuFBZGWXukf2s3N1HzmRzfcnw82.png","name":"A Plus Image 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-11-02","revenue":3424648,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Survival.
