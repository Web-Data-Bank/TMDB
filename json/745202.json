Kevin wastes no time in asking the obvious question, Cliff why are you so crazy? Of course the answer leads us into another Nigeria story with Prophet Joshua. Trust us, he is worth the time for a google search.  Kevin also discusses the trouble Cliff has been getting into domestically as well. From his federal lawsuit to being the reason why there are security cameras at his drug store, to his sit in protest of Ashley Furniture.  Also, Cliff has very interesting story about fellow concert goer and NXT Superstar, Sami Zayn that is well worth the purchase of this video on its own merit.  So, if your not onboard with this episode of The Kevin Steen Show then ...
