The Kliq. Look out wrestling promoters, there is a new band of brothers that are looking to run rough shot all over your promotion, and their name is The Uncut Connection. They are making their intentions known loud and clear on this very special edition of The Kevin Steen Show.  In order to wrap this whole thing up, Truth Martini steps onto set and discusses the origins of The Uncut Connection ( It's slightly shorter than Wolverine's origin story if you get my point). Truth Martini goes on to explain why he is such a charmer with the ladies, abundantly clear while reenacting a scene from Starrcade 88. Also, Truth talks about the time The Uncut Connection took on the NWO.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vHVaKwA2fvvO2smQ8Fo3fTa4zRw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kevin Steen Show: Truth Martini","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
