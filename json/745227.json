In this interview, we learn about his debut at the tender young age of 8 as one third of the six man trio known as The Men in Black. Although they never reached the heights of the Fabulous Freebirds, they were close in their own mind.  We also talk about his time as the Champion of Liechtenstein, the country where people dress like elves. Of course, we talk about the smaller stuff like his 873 day reign as Open the Freedom Gate Champion, going to Japan and his current run in PWG. You know the other stuff.  All joking aside, Johnny talks about a moment were a handicap almost ended his career. In a very serious Steen Show moment, Johnny talks about his near signing with TNA Wrestling to be a Twilight Vampire.  So, sit back back and enjoy as we talk to the Master of Lucharesu, Champion of Liechtenstein, and Cleveland's Own, Johnny Gargano.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1rH0pqCHFBzkNW9qRjECefxnb1K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kevin Steen Show: Johnny Gargano","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
