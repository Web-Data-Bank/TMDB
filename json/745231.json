So, lets just call this the Surreal Edition of The Kevin Steen Show because sitting across from Kevin is none other than Matt Hardy himself.  Matt is one of the most polarizing figures in pro wrestling today. Some people are huge Hardy fans and some of the \"smart\" fans hates everything he stands for in wrestling. Kevin explores this strange dichotomy throughout the interview and its seems to be one of the recurring themes.  It's also the first time Matt Hardy has opened up, on camera, since his recent battle with personal demons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rNv94U7qUpjA6540VNz5n28uBnP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kevin Steen Show: Matt Hardy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
