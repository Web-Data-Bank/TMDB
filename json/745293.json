For more than four decades, its owner, Madame Sicre -an old woman from a bourgeois family- began to rent his forty rooms to those who were looking for fast and cheap accommodation. Today, after several years in command of the building and completely exhausted, she is forced to give up the property. A young real estate agent is moved and accompanies her. However, a possible remodeling of the neighborhood threatens to turn the stories that keep the walls in ruin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hôtel Régina","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
