This baroque opera is a true feast for the senses, with peaks of sheer poetry and a sense of wonder. Director Fabio Ceresa was clearly inspired by the works of Gustav Klimt, both for the setting and the costumes. Conductor and Continuo Diego Fasolis leads the excellent Barocchisti ensemble with an elegant touch, and an unfailing ability to fully convey the musics nuanced coloratura. The production was very well received, with the cast highly praised by audience and critics alike. Sonia Prina proved highly convincing in the title role, both for the quality of her voice and for her outstanding acting skills - a true 'ba-rock star'. Lucia Cirillo (Alcina) was complimented by Bachtrack for her 'flawless coloratura and virtuosity in ornamentation', while Riccardo Novaro (Astolfo) displays a stylish poise and vocal warmth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b6F9SPHWVDNWk9I4Z5Kr0Ya6FCR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivaldi: Orlando Furioso","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
