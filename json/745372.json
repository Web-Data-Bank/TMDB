He was a man of many faces: vain, ambitious, more brutal than any other of Hitler's minions, yet the most popular Nazi official of all, at times even more popular than Hitler himself. He embodied the jovial side of the Third Reich. Yet the same man who organised dissolute bacchanals also founded the Gestapo, set up the first concentration camps, and had his own comrades murdered in the purge of 1934. These unique personal records form the largest and most important single film find from the Nazi era in past years.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/pDBPcbdsvt5c1mS4cyUG3HLmmyQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24678,"logo_path":"/2XgHpNJsBm6jh4CVrgqpLQemXmU.png","name":"CC\u0026C – Clarke Costelle et Cie","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":106809,"logo_path":"/xaEgRVMlv25HZv2E6IsxKqZMyEp.png","name":"AB Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goering: Nazi Number One","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5}
