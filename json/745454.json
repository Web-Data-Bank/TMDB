Delivered in January 1968 at the Goethe House in New York, Arendt's speech paid tribute to Benjamin's ideologies surrounding linguistic philosophy, history and literature. Arendt notes the importance of German-Jewish literature in Benjamin's work, insisting that \"without being a poet, he thought poetically. For him the metaphor was the greatest gift of language, because it transforms the invisible into the sensual.\" (Hannah Ardent) Through his passion for writers such as Kafka, Goethe and Proust, Benjamin honed his own sort of theology revolving around classic texts, preservation, and the collecting of wisdom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cmUw8aTYso1rOk4wYlwZBWMUtkh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hannah Arendt: On Walter Benjamin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
