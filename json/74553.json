A 67-year-old heart attack survivor returns to conquer the race that nearly killed her, a family in mourning runs to honor the memory of their beloved, a group of film animators test the limits of their athleticism (or lack thereof), and a group of aging jocks show they still know how to have a good time. A celebration of personal determination and the power of family and friends, HOOD TO COAST proves that you're never too old or too young to attempt the extraordinary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hood to Coast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
