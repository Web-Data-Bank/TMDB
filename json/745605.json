Events make an absurd, surreal, maybe a dadaist turn after which to reach her objectives, Aino and her peers are obliged to search for the answer to the mysteries of the modern human condition. Thus follows a satirical, antimodernist continuum of monologues, mixed-media footage and introductions of modern subjectivity. The film is a flight through the darker sides of fossil-fueled European rationalism, shedding light on techno-capitalist-individualist age of modern alienation, hauntological nostalgies of imagined futures, the profound problematics of translating human communication, the post-human sides of Jean Sibelius – and finally – the reindeers of the north.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/649HfenomVw30fHEZhUROBakp3M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2019-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sibelius Continuum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
