This story is about how artists with different social status, education, views of the world were united, once the decision was made - to go out and turn it into a stage. Underground passages, subway cars, avenues, parks and squares are their battlefields for the indifference of passers-by; the opportunity to do what you burn from; to be heard; a sense of freedom and independence; searching for your audience; a step on the way to the stadiums; not uncommon and just a way not to die of hunger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xFKvJNVMaO7kKKsf4yKJ5Tmbue5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To The Street!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
