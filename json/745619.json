The only problem is: he never bothered to tell Bethany. In fact, Andy's never even spoken to her. But with the prom only twenty-four hours away, he's not going to let a little thing like that get him down. He's got bigger problems. Mainly the fact that America is on the brink of a nuclear war that not only threatens to destroy the free world, but his prom night as well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"All's fair in love and nuclear war","title":"Armageddon for Andy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
