He goes on a summer trip together with the family of his daughter. Together they fly to the sea, and little by little the trip to Italy and Greece takes on the dimensions of an ancient tragedy: mortal danger and miraculous salvation, difficulties in translation and conflicts between generations. Human life turns out to be a journey full of emotions that can hardly be borne.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4DZXUlfdE2Hp1Du0o8TFKQzgcSM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119417,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Company Leosfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Papa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
