The show tells the story of Howard, who is having trouble producing his fantasy musical review because of constant set backs, a disagreeable cast and technical problems. In addition, he is haunted by the discouraging words of his high school guidance counselor, Miss Roundhole, who told him he would work in the theater “when pigs fly.” As Howard tries to navigates the evening of skits and songs, he learns that the problem isn’t that he has “gone too far,” but instead has not gone far enough. The show closes with an unbelievable drag showgirl finale reminiscent of Beach Blanket Babylon and Ziegfield’s Follies.","popularity":0.609,"poster_path":"/eOoe7QrILFIt3V3TIYMODf5d52O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Short North Stage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Pigs Fly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
