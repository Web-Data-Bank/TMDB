The main characters in Children of the Night are five boy soldiers under the age of 15. These children, who are raised as “bombs of anger” by ISIS, are war criminals and at the same time victims. How are we supposed to live with these children? How can they live a life in the world? Behind the beautiful shots captured with elaborate close-ups, director Nouranipour tackles a burdensome question.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eli Image","origin_country":"IR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2020-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
