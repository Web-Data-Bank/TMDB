Issa’s escape from West Africa to the European mainland lasted ten years. Everything was supposed to be better here. But when he arrived in Rome, the only thing waiting for the young man was a life of homelessness and unemployment – which meant no money to send home. Drissa and Sekou share a similar fate, waiting in Italian asylum centres for a residence permit. Then there’s Bubu, who, forced to move from job to job, is unable to settle down. And lastly comes Alassane, who lives without identity papers in a state of constant uncertainty in a refugee camp near Rome. They all have one thing in common: after a gruelling odyssey, none of them has found the Italy they were hoping for when they arrived. Disillusioned, they find themselves in a vacuum of waiting, reflecting on the time they live in and the time that lies ahead.","popularity":0.609,"poster_path":"/sxx6tqNzabehmAals7oYZGG4CV8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
