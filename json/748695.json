An experiment in machine learning, Tay was given the persona and colloquial speech patterns of a 19-year-old millennial in order to interact with the world. During her brief online existence, she was aggressively trolled by users on social media, evolving into a racist, misogynistic, homophobe that made alt-right slurs and pledged allegiance to Hitler. Tay became the embodiment of the worst traits of humanity, and after less than 16 hours she was promptly terminated by Microsoft.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"i’m here to learn so :))))))","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
