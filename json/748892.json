Memories accost him-memories of his school days, of loved ones long gone, of wonder, callousness, and defeat. The painful invasion gives rise to a series reflections on the limits of cinema and the poverty, and inescapability, of the life of the mind. No matter how much he has tried to change, the young man-who may or may not be the filmmaker himself-always returns to the same places, same questions, same faces, same recollections-the same nails in his brain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jLqBuztTBKTCvPfiuC5Ms2zfDeJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125028,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ucqar Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2020-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nails in My Brain","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
