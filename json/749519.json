It's about ill-advised couples counseling, love, trust, lust and revenge. It's about the masked killer in the woods, ready to take an axe to your head if you can't sort your shit out. It's about two couples, Violet and Henry, and Martin and Sasha, all looking for their own perfect weekend away, not knowing of course that Violet has promised the perfect weekend to her one true, and far less friendly, love. Hearts will be broken.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2YRzJv4JUCD2dsSnOFI0Tt86I9A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Killer Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
