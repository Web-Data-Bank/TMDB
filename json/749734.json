Together, against everyone and everything, they will face a series of obstacles trying to separate them, meanwhile figuring out what love and pain are. Debuting at Curtas, French filmmaker Elsa Rysto presents a love story mediated by ultraviolence, in a modern variation on the classic story of Bonnie and Clyde – or of the more contemporary Mickey and Mallory from “Natural Born Killers”. “Love Hurts” is a simple yet sensitive narrative about the so-called growing pains.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5L2SvZHXpHf4A0MDVxW6abvt3w4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yggdrasil Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Hurts","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
