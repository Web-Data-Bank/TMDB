When she, with much reluctance, goes back home for her brother’s wedding, she realises that he is about to marry her childhood enemy, Catrine. At the same time, Laura finds out that Catrine has in fact taken over her place in the family – and what if Laura wants it back … A film about how we, no matter how hard we try, cannot escape from our past, nor from our roots.","popularity":1.127,"poster_path":"/wvJvmuvbQNJAaGMsARiuTp9qJj6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119770,"logo_path":"/v6WgNpXooYFG8tS0Xau6UGMR7Ww.png","name":"Hyæne Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Persona Non Grata","video":false,"vote_average":7.333,"vote_count":6}
