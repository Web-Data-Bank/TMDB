Blue Rose is a documentary essay that takes you through an intercontinental flower auction in the Netherlands, Japan's crazy scientific experiments, a pagan celebration in a Spanish town, and the nostalgic Soviet photo archives of the family garden. The Blue Rose reminds us that the ephemeral nature of flowers is deceiving, and a closer look at them can teach an important lesson about the world in which we live.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zAYyRVK9CAJeYsKSSFGgWnirq75.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
