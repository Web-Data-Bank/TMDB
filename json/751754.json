They share the courage and the pride of working continuously. Chehma is a former master fisherman, owner of a boat. Even though it leaks a little, he dreams of taking it back to sea. Abdesslam works as a street musician and his major objective is to arrange the marriage of his oldest son. Erradi, an innkeeper, is proud of his 30 year-old car and lives like a hermit, surrounded by an amazing collection of old clocks. Each in their own way demonstrates beautifully a strong will to live.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w0o5jICQ1vjTXjNFymIo1hjMfOB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turtles Do Not Die of Old Age","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
