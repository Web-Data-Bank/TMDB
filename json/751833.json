Instead of being accepted by a community, they see themselves as trapped in their adolescent dreams, because a world oriented exclusively towards material values cannot offer them an ideal place to live. Either one's spirit is broken when the individual is integrated into society, or the individual breaks with society. In both cases, the young adult is susceptible to seduction in a number of possible ways, eventually becoming a victim rather than a member of society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":141630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coyote-Markus-Wogrolly Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":115599,"logo_path":"/oy7KfmJ1cVX4JlmheLukhHvrkox.png","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Restless Solitude","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
