This problem is extremely relevant in the current political situation of Brazil in face of the repeated environmental and social catastrophes that are being inflicted upon us.These people have a way of acting which favours a sustainable development, their knowledge should be respected.The world is divided in two categories, independent of any ideology:the rich world and the poor world.We related the religious rituals, the artistic and the mystic trances in a Brazil where poverty and hunger are invisible to a large part of the society. A country of people that has invisible myths and such a rich diversity is being transformed into a unison and melancholic chant. The Guardians Forest whose leader was murdered last Dec, tells us what motivates their fight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iNfGphm0YFzuDmfQ3Nf7ZmdYh3Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143111,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luba Filmes","origin_country":""},{"id":143112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paloma Cinematográfica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tentehar: Sensitive Architecture","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
