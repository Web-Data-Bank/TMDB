Politically incorrect, radical, renewing, Chacrinha changed Brazilian television forever and expressed a Brazil that was around it, but was not perceived. The film tells the great adventure of Abelardo Barbosa through the eyes of the presenter. It gathers the nuclei of its constellation - chacretes, fledglings and artists who passed through its programs - to identify their individualities and their emotions.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/oqrVc3lPwYzHLiCiIH7y2tf2lQ2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2009-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello, Hello, Terezinha!","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
