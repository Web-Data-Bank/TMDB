All the conversations are shot in interior rooms, attesting to trust and great candour. They talk about work, relationships, what’s left of the day, and families – which is naturally political. Chetna Vora began studying directing at the HFF Babelsberg in 1976. Frauen in Berlin would have been her first feature film; however, the HFF broke off production before it was finished, and the negative material was largely destroyed. What remains is a rough version that was secretly filmed on video beforehand, an invaluable and candid document, especially in this form.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s4O95ERvB8xXZWmYJThw1KXjpgc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frauen in Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
