The village, hitherto famous mostly for its sauerkraut and the “Radegast” beer was thus turned into an industrial zone – the largest greenfield investment project in the Czech Republic’s history. Nonetheless, for a long time many farmers resisted selling the land upon which the factory was now standing. Eventually, they all succumbed under the pressure from the neighbours, and even the anonymous death threats. The filmmakers returned to Nošovice two years after the dramatic property buyouts, at the time when the factory has just started churning out cheap cars. Combining the perspectives of seven characters, they have composed a portrayal of a place suddenly changed beyond recognition that is playful and chilling at the same time: a politically engaged absurd flick about a field that yields cars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uWTDQuN46A64yNttRzTExgIVzcs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8655,"logo_path":"/iy3xGixP7KGlZ6eNgsDv28DXBOl.png","name":"Hypermarket Film","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":6222,"logo_path":"/lMSKOpqzE0LTlWkjS562SRU4rkH.png","name":"Avion Film \u0026 Sound","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2011-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All for the good of the World and Nosovice","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
