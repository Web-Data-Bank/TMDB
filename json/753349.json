While waiting for a train she smiles at Bobby and he smiles back. Papa catches them at it, and horrified, hustles her away, after delivering a severe lecture on the subject of flirting. A few minutes later Pa Tubbs happens to pick up a sheet of paper on which Bobby had been industriously \"figgering,\" and finds written on it, \"My profit $50,000.\" Deciding the young man must be a millionaire in disguise, Pa Tubbs immediately makes amends by introducing his daughter to Bobby, who is rather bewildered, but tells them, \"My father is Major-Gen. Tucker.\" This augments the young man's prestige, and he is invited to spend a week at the Tubbs' home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Young Man Who 'Figgered'","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
