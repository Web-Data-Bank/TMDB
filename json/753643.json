Director Rohan Shivkumar grew up in the titular apartment block, located in Borivali —an affluent coastal suburb of Mumbai. The building was designed by Charles Correa to house different communities within one edifice, as an articulation of the ideal environment for the Indian middle classes. Rohan, whose parents lived in the colony for over 40 years, explores its architecture with the aid of found materials, including old photographs and drawings, as well as personal narratives both factual and semi-fictional.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8IsSr7V5DUS1HVM31lYTmZDK4Ff.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LOVELY VILLA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
