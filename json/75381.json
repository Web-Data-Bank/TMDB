To capture a butterfly's point of view, NOVAâ€™s filmmakers used a helicopter, ultralight, and hot-air balloon for aerial views along the transcontinental route. This wondrous annual migration, which scientists are just beginning to fathom, is an endangered phenomenon that could dwindle to insignificance if the giant firs that the butterflies cling to during the winter disappear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d06ZtZJ7cfmSk65CQ6HMU9Mvppr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5827,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nova","origin_country":""},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Incredible Journey of the Butterflies","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
