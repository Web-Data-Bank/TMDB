Zuo Lin, a poor bow-legged boy, has a small dream - to ride a zebra across the busiest part of the city. Zuo Lin’s transition from an unhappy rider of a rocking-horse, through a happy zebra-rider and a sorrowful hussar officer, to a beaming paper horse rider makes for an absorbing film with a grand narrative. Yet, on the surface, it’s a popular story - girlfriend of a trust fund kid tries to help her boyfriend trick Zuo Lin, but ends up falling in love with him.","popularity":0.859,"poster_path":"/heu3fpHV4ybpeMH4DSEPA9AEp2o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Zebra-Riding Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
