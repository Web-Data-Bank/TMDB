The video juxtaposes images and sounds recorded at various locations in Vietnam and features two appeals expressed by two supposed ghosts: one is hearable via an audio production by the 6th Psychological Operations Battalion (PSYOP) of the US-Army during America's war in Vietnam, which was intended as a weapon to weaken the fighting morale of the Vietcong, distributed via loudspeakers over their supply routes. The other ghost makes herself heard using Sung Tieu's aunt as her medium.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4dG0J4lLXFGEmvA88RmYYkoA7yu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2017-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Gods, No Masters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
