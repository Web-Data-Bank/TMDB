Also a master of wood engraving, Hu Jie breathes new life into the expressionist tradition of Käthe Kollwitz. In his works — including those produced in Paris for this film — Hu Jie recreates terrifying moments of organized crimes against the Chinese people during the famine of the “Great Leap Forward” and the “Cultural Revolution”. Bertrand Renaudineau’s and Gérard da Silva’s film offers Hu Jie his first chance to tell how he was a wood engraver before becoming a filmmaker; how, he freed the “soul of a young martyr”; and how his prints and documentaries have helped convey the experiences of the Chinese to people all around the world.
