I am cooking.” Six years after Jane Gabriel made the documentary “Island Οf Outcasts” revealing the inhuman conditions in the adult asylum on Leros, she returned to meet some of the men who had been kept naked in block 16 for decades, and women who had lived in filthy conditions. Now living freely with support in the community they talk about their new lives. This film records how Leros was transformed for both the ex-inmates and the staff - from being an island of incarceration and misery, into an island of liberty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cQsreAnQGZTj5tsA9xxFBZSIZUh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gabriel Productions Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leros - The Τransformation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
