Three Belarusian filmmakers document personal stories of people caught up in the political turmoil. Filmmaker Maksim Shved was arrested, imprisoned and then released while the protests around him swelled. Meanwhile, Ekaterina Markavets observes the psychological burden of her fellow citizens and worked with professional psychologists to set up a volunteer support service for people affected by current events. Andrei Kutsila followed a celebrated Belarusian broadcast journalist who worked for State TV for nearly 40 years, now in hospital recovering from injuries she sustained while at a protest. All three filmmakers wonder what the future holds for their country and fellow citizens.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/omh0T8k4IJoxD3ug9EueUOxKAIo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87763,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Guardian","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belarus: Personal Stories From a Country in Turmoil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
