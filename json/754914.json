The film explores how special interests bankroll political campaigns and relentlessly lobby to rig the system in their favor, all while following the letter of the law.  Featuring luminaries and leaders including Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig and sitting member of Congress Rep. Justin Amash, the film reveals the powerful possibilities to reform our government to better represent the people.  UnRepresented serves as a rallying call to bring committed public servants, activists and everyday Americans together to take action across partisan lines to change our flawed political system.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x4dV3ahF9ND20NDhxhAE0DEOzSn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unrepresented","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
