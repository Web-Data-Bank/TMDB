From her outrageous costumes to wildly teased hair, Diller was a pioneer among female comediennes, paving the way for future stars. Who can forget her hilarious housekeeping and marriage tips, her beleaguered husband Fang, her cackling laugh and self-deprecating sense of humor? Phyllis Diller: Not Just Another Pretty Face highlights some of her best routines. Special guest stars such as Don Rickles and Dean Martin make this a fun trip back in time.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/6VdU1veOtQGUkG8UCWiykOdThkS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5463,"logo_path":null,"name":"MPI Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phyllis Diller: Not Just Another Pretty Face","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
