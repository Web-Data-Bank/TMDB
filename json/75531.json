Facing a failing career, Susann meets a successful promoter who becomes her husband. After several failures to place her in commercials and a TV quiz show, he hits upon the idea for her to become a writer. In the pre-1960s, her books were looked upon as trash and non-printable. But then the sexual revolution hit and an audience was born for her books. The story shows the hidden behind-the-scenes story of Susann's life, including her autistic son and her continuing bout with cancer which she hid up until her death.","popularity":2.769,"poster_path":"/2JiksEdYKyAI9awGUde1bu5YqGA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":882,"logo_path":"/iDw9Xxok1d9WAM2zFicI8p3khTH.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mutual Film Company","origin_country":""},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":10513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lobell/Bergman Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":4650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marubeni","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":7237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tele MÃ¼nchen Fernseh Produktionsgesellschaft (TMG)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-28","revenue":3003296,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Talent isn't everything...","title":"Isn't She Great","video":false,"vote_average":4.758,"vote_count":31}
