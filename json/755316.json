This moving and powerful portrait of a unique and brave woman weaves Namjoshi’s life and writings into a sensual tapestry.  Born into an Indian royal family, Namjoshi discusses her reasons for leaving India (she fell in love with her best friend), and her experiences as a cultural outsider in the U.S. Showing how “language invents worlds,” her vision as an Indian lesbian feminist is informed both by a lesbian consciousness and a deep Indian cultural framework. A prolific writer who has been widely published in the U.K., Canada and India over the past twenty years, Namjoshi’s poems, fables and novels are characterized by her wit and wry, satirical sense of humor. FLESH AND PAPER, captures the spirit of Namjoshi’s poetry in an evocative, multi-layered way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flesh and Paper","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
