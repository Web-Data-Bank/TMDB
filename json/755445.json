The film is made in the technique of applying an image on a 35mm film. As a source material used some footage from the film by Evgeny Yufit \"Silver Heads\". In 1999, the film \"Cola\" took part in the Berlinale. Plot: nature cannot stop science, which creates a hybrid of man and tree.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uE8DFGhvWj9p048yr5oSoMvblbg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1999-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stakes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
