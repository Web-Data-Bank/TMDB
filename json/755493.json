When Kaboo's people could not pay his ransom, the young prince was readied for execution. But at the last minute, there was a blinding flash of light and a mysterious voice that said, 'Run Kaboo, run!' Escaping his enemies, Kaboo found his way to an American Missionary outpost where he became a Christian. After learning all he could from the American missionaries, Kaboo (now taking on the name Samuel Morris as a witness to his new life) was determined to set out for America where he could learn more about his Savior. He survived a harrowing over-sea journey and amazed the hard-bitten sailors with his tenacious faith. Arriving in New York, Morris continued to tell his astonishing story to all who would listen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qkuxVjtAB52BnyARSzig9U11yO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gary Wilkinson Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samuel Morris: The African Missionary to North America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
