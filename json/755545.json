A quest into a universal existential problem, how to inhabit the world. Members of a family leave their home and in the middle of the Cuban Sierra Maestra struggle to find a new one. During this process they inhabit scenes of a routine life in the middle of nature, outside of a closed space between four walls, place and concept they long and project. It concludes with the departure of the patriarch and the already palpable absence of a father with dark gaze who dreams of going far away from his country in the pursuit of something different, becomes a reality. Contemplative meditation of an internal torment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wQYzIwp7KSZTTstySuXA5PlicZ2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exilio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
