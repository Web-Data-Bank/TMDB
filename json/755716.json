Recorded in 1965 on the day he acquired his first Sony Portapak camera, this previously unknown work has recently been rediscovered and restored. Recorded on computer tape, this technically fragile piece documents a single performance action â€” Paik buttoning and unbuttoning his jacket. A spirit of conceptual Fluxus humor underlies this seminal recording.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3szUkfvH09jpxYPrlpeiLwd0SqD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Button Happening","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
