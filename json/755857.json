She’s a fisher, profession transmitted from mother to daughter. She learned it from her mother. But since a few years, Lake Tchad has been shrinking, and fish has become rare. Kellou’s job is threatened. One day, after an un- successful catch, her 12 year old daughter Mouna gives her an idea: pick up plastic bags invading the lake and make ropes out of it to sell them on the market. By this simple gesture, Kellou gets to, in her own way, fight against plastic pollution and adapt to the new conditions brought about by climate change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gVihKm9oP99rmwKtvI5TOuLo5MG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114951,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Union","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TD","name":"Chad"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Luba-Katanga","iso_639_1":"lu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lac","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
