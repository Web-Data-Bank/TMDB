By the time of this show, Wonder had already enjoyed an astonishing and visionary career - first as `Little Stevie,' Motown prodigy, then as a musical adventurer in Funk and electronics. A master of both the romantic radio ballad and mature, hard-hitting dance music, Stevie shows the BBC audience every side of his enormous talent. In songs from across his multi-faceted career: `Higher Ground,' `Superstition,' `My Cherie Amour,' `Signed, Sealed, Delivered,' `You Are The Sunshine of My Life' and `I Just Called to Say I Love You,' among others. In this performance, Stevie reminds us of the soulful emotion and musical dexterity that have made him one of the most fascinating artists of our time.
