Throughout his forced travels from the Bor copper mine in Serbia to a remote work camp and finally to a mass grave in a Hungarian village, Radnoti was determined to keep writing and to find a way to preserve his poems. The film is at once a love story, an examination of Radnoti’s patriotism, and a sobering view of the Hungarian holocaust. Radnoti’s startlingly original poems are read in translation and, most movingly, in Hungarian.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neither Memory Nor Magic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
