Having found his wife with the choir director, Nikolai demanded a divorce. Continuing to love each other, the former spouses are unhappy in separation. Kasatkin's new hasty marriage did not return his peace of mind. In daily agony, in the pursuit of a past life, he also lost his old dream — to live and work in the Far East, where he served in the army. Both realized too late that love does not forgive hasty decisions, that it must be able to keep and protect.","popularity":0.652,"poster_path":"/af3U36SeewDxjglr7UiSyVOVTxp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1976-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Only One","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2}
