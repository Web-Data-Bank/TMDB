Her fiancee, Grisha thinks the child may be Shura's own, and his suspicions estrange them. This leaves the way clear for a shy neighbor who has loved her from afar to gain points as a potential mate. Stenberg's design is simple and effective - a strongly-colored portrait of the pensive heroine at a table that provides space for the title and limited credits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f40hAr4Ucu3qr5zoBEnGDAR8WU7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12617,"logo_path":"/9Wf5DFTvzxo0pSqDp8MQWW3d01.png","name":"Belarusfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1940-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
