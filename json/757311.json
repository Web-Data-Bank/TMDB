The studio addresses the problem that not only China is facing as we see the increasing destruction and exploitation of rural communities and culture. Sited in Hangzhou, China, The Big Build was created by American Desmond Loren DeLanty, founder of the architecture and research firm Hangzhou Art & Design Collaborative (HADC).
