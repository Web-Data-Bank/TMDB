Not many albums can claim to have created a new genre, but with its fusion of metal, progressive rock, ambient textures, and acoustic singer-songwriter styled material, it became a blueprint for a generation of bands to come. It also represented a commercial breakthrough for the band, eventually going on to sell three times more than the band’s previous releases. In Absentia features many of Porcupine Tree’s most beloved songs, including Trains, The Sound of Muzak and Blackest Eyes. While not a formal concept album, many of the songs have common themes related to serial killers, youthful innocence gone wrong, and observations of the modern world, setting a template for many of songwriter Steven Wilson's future songs.","popularity":1.145,"poster_path":"/rZcBZvFmX3wQ9VhJ28JhcjiJGLx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porcupine Tree - In Absentia","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
