John Grierson and his National Film Board of Canada become targets of an anti-Communist blacklist in the immediate post-war years, after Soviet clerk Igor Gouzenko produced documents revealing a spy ring operating in Canada. With a cast featuring Eric Peterson as Grierson, Saul Rubinek as Gouzenko, and Aaron Schwartz as Communist Party MP Fred Rose, this forgotten piece of Canadian history is brought to life in a very compelling CBC drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A8H5fEmOMRM359iXLLTI8BvzTd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grierson and Gouzenko","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
