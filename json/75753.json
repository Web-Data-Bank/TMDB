He's a slob, she's controlling. She works too much, he won't get a job. Time goes by... They both want out, finally something they can agree on! But at the end of every relationship there's that one awkward moment. That time when when you're forced to face each other, maybe at a restaurant, the dry cleaner or maybe the old apartment.
