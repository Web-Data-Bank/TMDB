Wind, made on a snowy beach on Long Island in 1968, is one of her first performances incorporating the use of mirrors. Various figures perform enigmatic actions fighting against the wind: covered in masks, they walk back to back or take their coats on and off. Filmed with long shots, Jonas allows the wind to dictate the movements of the performers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bLWbYf8UdISHLZ3DWwRGagyRNP4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Songdelay","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
