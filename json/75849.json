Davis takes his audience through a side-splitting, roller coaster riot of subjects ranging from The Hood to Hollywood, as well as hood-rats and heaven. From relationships gone bad to rappers gone rogue, nothing is too taboo and no one is safe from the knock-out power punches that only DeRay The Difference can deliver. Filmed in front of a sold-out audience at the Best Buy Theater in New York s Times Square, Power Play is DeRay's best uncensored performance to-date and will surely be regarded as a classic among the comedy greats.","popularity":1.23,"poster_path":"/1uiaSxiz4wv2IeuuhWcHAJlyVw4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35327,"logo_path":null,"name":"Codeblack Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deray Davis:  Power Play","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
