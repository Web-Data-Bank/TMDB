This place-based fabulation grounded in the valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, bastardizes Mesoamerican myths around four figures: a Hill, an Agave, an Opossum and Lady Reed. Lady Reed is a mythical Mixtec character who helps the opossum to cut the agave leaves in order to get its sugary alcoholic sap. Opossum Resilience overlaps the time of creation with a contemporary socio-environmental conflict around the imposition of a mining project in an Indigenous Territory. It summons the powers of festivity and inhebriation; and imagines an opossum providing an activist with the mythical powers to play dead and then revive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opossum Resilience","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
