The girl suffers from an extremely rare genetic skin condition. Her skin, as sensitive as a butterfly's wing, falls apart under the gentlest touch. The only possibility to alleviate the girl's suffering is an expensive surgery in the USA, which entails high risk. The camera captures her parents in poignant moments of despair and their glimmers of hope when they are trying to survive this emotional rollercoaster. What is the most impressive in this film is Zuzia herself, who is aware of her situation in a very mature way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2jrWVfqG5mMWjykZBrSunqTICQP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2020-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Butterfly's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
