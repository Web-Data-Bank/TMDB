This short film is a present day look at the life of a young saint who died at the ripe age of 24-- The places he lived and frequented  \"The week before I left for Italy to shoot this film, I realized I did not have nearly enough money to cover the costs of stock and processing. I was spending time with my Grandpa in adoration at Church, when suddenly, after I loaded him up in the car, a small Spanish woman tapped me on the shoulder and gave me an envelope saying, \"Here, this is a gift from God.\" She scampered away, and I opened it, deeply touched, as I pulled out two thousand dollars. I could never find this woman to thank her, though I have looked for her every time I return to that same parish.\" - Jake Hart","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/29O9RlD9tq7v9EeETHQEnM9itGE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"July 4th, 1925","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
