As no specific cause was identified, there was an immediate torrent of assumptions and speculation. The film uses local children to retell the story.  \"It's based on a true story of mass hysteria in 2015 - pleased to have made it last year as this year it wouldn't be possible to have 29 teenagers in a studio together. A timely re-telling.\" - Alex Culshaw","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sqVaL3ZRbz5aPNj6rUxcvgYYPCK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ripple","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
