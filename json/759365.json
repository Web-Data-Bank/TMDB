The audience is witnessing a film being made as they watch.  61 Scenes, 58 Camera Setups, and everything LIVE - this is definitely not a zoom call. The film tells the story of four twenty-something co-workers, bored with their day jobs and sick of being locked up in isolation, who play a silly online game and unwittingly prove the truth of an urban legend. However, whilst they may not be able to get out, that doesn't mean that something can't get in.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shadow It Waits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
