Offended by the Emperor’s insolence, Death refuses to let anyone die, wreaking havoc throughout the world.  Der Kaiser von Atlantis's origin as the only surviving opera composed in a Nazi concentration camp elevates it to a unique memorial against forgetting. Yet in the Deutsche Oper am Rhein’s production, the parable of living death is never cautionary, but ominous, disturbingly comical and deeply human.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4xgLjPJ0okbc2UXLakXY57x9HOC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ullmann: Der Kaiser von Atlantis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
