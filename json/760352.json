Because of its spacious parks and the large number of enthusiastically singing birds, Berlin is the best city to make music with nightingales. Almost everything one plays to a nightingale will encourage him to sing more. These encounters becomes a direct window into the unknown, a touch of communication with a being with whom we cannot speak. The play of pure tones jarring against click and buzz, it all becomes not a code but a groove, an amphitheater of rhythms in which we strive to find a place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fv8u77EgUxmiRiheDzIuMSMwbOd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Playart Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2019-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightingales in Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
