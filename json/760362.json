Mixing live-action with animated puppets and objects, Bowers helmed a score of little-known mini-masterpieces, many starring himself.  This exhaustive introduction to Bowersâ€™s oeuvre, over 2 hours of material, includes the shorts Egged On (1926), He Done His Best (1926), Fatal Footsteps (1926), Now You Tell One (1926), Many a Slip (1927), There It Is (1928), and It's a Bird (1930). With an introduction by filmmaker, distributor and archivist Serge Bromberg, founder and chairman of Lobster Films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Extraordinary World of Charley Bowers","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
