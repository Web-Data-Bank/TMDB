These alternate with five rock videos, two directed by Derek Jarman (Panic and Ask), two by Tim Broad (Girlfriend in a Coma and Stop Me...), and one by Paula Grief and Richard Levine (How Soon Is Now?). It concludes with Jarman's short film, \"The Queen Is Dead,\" with a three-song soundtrack. The rock videos, particularly Jarman's, are filled with multiple and superimposed images, changing tints, and little narrative coherence; they get their pace from the music's rhythm. Androgyny, dancing children, belching smokestacks, graffiti, angry young men, a waif in a cap: collages of modern alienation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uMJ1e4VG5CrKjp6fNPUfIUVdp2B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Smiths - The Complete Picture","video":true,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":6}
