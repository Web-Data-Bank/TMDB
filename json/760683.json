The series recasts the Space Age as a fascinating stew of scientific innovation, political calculation, media spectacle, visionary impulses and personal drama. Utilizing a visual feast of previously overlooked and lost archival material — much of which has never before been seen by the public — the film features a diverse cast of characters who played key roles in these historic events.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/noxwHdVkzY8hd8BqdLsLZvDAHgQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
