Lieutenant Galois is assigned the investigation of this murder. She receives the diary of Lieutenent Guy Rossi who served under The Colonel in Algeria in 1956, and has been reported as missing in action since 1957. The revelations found in Rossi's diary go far beyond The Colonel's actions in Algeria, and give an insight on how dirty Algeria's War for Independence really was.","popularity":0.88,"poster_path":"/j7uzNau9xUsoNuYBNEytFsSSotA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1926,"logo_path":"/sORCydQs61kwWqRIIzPiBpgVVag.png","name":"Les Films du Fleuve","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2006-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colonel","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":7}
