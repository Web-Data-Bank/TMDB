With the ongoing release of millions of tons of toxic pollutants into the air from poorly regulated oil refineries and petro-chemical plants, residents are told to \"Shelter in Place\" by staying in their homes and taping up their windows and doors. Communities living on the fence-line of Texan industry are usually low income and powerless to protest. This film is an intimate portrait of a community battling against environmental pollution and unfettered corporate power.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vuQAVhngn17TEH3VIujTBJUysQh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shelter in Place","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
