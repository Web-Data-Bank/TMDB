This planet is about to be recycled, refurbished, started over. That doesn't mean it's going to be destroyed, it doesn't mean it's the end of the world. But it does mean that it is going to be spaded under. Now, you can say, \"Well, who are you to say that?\" And I'll tell you who I am. As to whether or not you believe who I am is up to you. And whether or not you believe that this civilization is going to be recycled or refurbished is up to you. Now, the purpose of this tape is to warn you that this is about to happen, and that it's going to happen very soon.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/FN7n68eYhUk6iZfP01WkTbvLM0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Chance to Evacuate Earth Before It's Recycled","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
