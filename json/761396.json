Relationships are visceral attachments, often leading to one dominating and consuming the other, then moving on easily and heartlessly. This film is autobiographical, a visual metaphor of an experience I had in my youth with one of my first girlfriends, perhaps the first love of my life. We learn a lot from experiences like this.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eWyUHLZElAYTTmboO1gAriAENwf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blend Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handshake","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
