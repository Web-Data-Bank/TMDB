Everyone believes that Zeisig is a man named Hansen, Hitler's personal astrologer. But Zeisig quickly realizes that he's gone from the frying pan into the fire. In the Hotel Lux he meets his friends Frida and later Meyer again, still passionate communists. For the three idealists an adventure between love and death begins to run his course.","popularity":2.329,"poster_path":"/pOrN7RADnZ9COqMQX9Cd9LMJVJ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16937,"logo_path":"/8AFNIZ179EwZiCrY3JldjQg891y.png","name":"Bavaria Pictures","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colonia Media Filmproduktions GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Shark Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1704,"logo_path":"/sb3PuMTgJgpPUY7x634etBAhodu.png","name":"Bavaria Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":5382,"logo_path":null,"name":"BSI International Invest","origin_country":""},{"id":18270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beeplex","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":18271,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rainer Windhager Film Production","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":6187,"logo_path":"/gtC63XG8fkFxszIuZIogffM1oY8.png","name":"ARD Degeto","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":88461,"logo_path":null,"name":"herbX Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel Lux","video":false,"vote_average":5.786,"vote_count":42}
