They roam through open spaces, without hurry. They rest in the middle of the road or under high voltage towers. They talk about life and death, ask what for are the teachers, about the big animals that died out many years ago, about absolute darkness, about foreign languages and about the news that comes to us in glass bottles. They make us question adulthood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2019-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This day we saw the volcano","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
