The prime suspect is none other than the diabolical Dr. Lo-Tov. But just as Agent Emes is about to bring him in, the police identify a different suspect, someone VERY CLOSE to Agent Emes. With the case taking on a more personal turn, Agent Emes must race against the clock to uncover the truth behind the stolen pushka. The story evolves in classic \"whodunit\" fashion, with a number of likely suspects emerging, before episode 3 reaches its shocking conclusion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fnDTRqjgBTI2vMqZBqPX0Q23Woo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84690,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel Jewish Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agent Emes 3: The Case of the Missing Pushka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
