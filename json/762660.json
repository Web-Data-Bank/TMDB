Filmmaker Jon Coley reduced costs by taking on the starring roles, performing both innocent man and evil doppelganger. Jon chose an atmospheric Brian Eno soundtrack to perfectly meld with the action, which was shot in 1981 on location at Prestatyn's High Street and seafront. Coley's mother, Shirley, fully supported her son's endeavours, acting as cameraperson in this film. Jon Coley's inspiration came from watching cult TV series such as 'The Outer Limits', 'The Invaders' and Patrick McGoohan's 'Danger Man'.
