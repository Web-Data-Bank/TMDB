Your life is a miracle, and the Creator of the universe knows you by name... He's big enough to breathe out stars, yet intricate enough to fashion together the trillions of cells that make up every facet of who you are. The God who spoke the universe into existence made you, too, and knows everything about you. From the smallest molecule to the situation you find yourself in right now, He's aware of your circumstances and intimately acquainted with everything you do. And He cares about you and promises to carry you through. That's where we find hope in the midst of the darkest places in life. The journey often complicated and painful, filled with confusion and chaos. Yet, the cross of Christ reveals God's promise to preserve and restore you no matter what the circumstance. He will hold onto you and hold you together, giving strength to those who hope in His unfailing love. He is the everlasting God!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/97pahdkCrgvezqt5fsndLHNEe69.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Louie Giglio: How Great Is Our God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
