The subjects speak for themselves, offering candid glimpses into the disparate worlds of a junkyard dealer who steals cars, a Bowery bum and the wife he abandoned, a welfare mother living in a condemned building with her five children, a male prostitute, a devout Puerto Rican factory worker, and an aging Italian barber and his wife. Called \"a triumph of its kind\" by The Washington Post, this unsentimental portrait of the uncommon lives of common people is a subjective sociological study of survival in urban America.","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/78uf5Yz64MHkY1eJRxBXvsx6v3Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Third Avenue: Only the Strong Survive","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
