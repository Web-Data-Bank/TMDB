In addition, she has a little blackmail operation going on on the side with politicians who can't afford a scandal. She got started on this business after she was raped, and hasn't looked back since. Now the police are on her trail, and she avails herself of the services of a couple who make a profession of hiding wanted criminals. At the hideout, she meets Simon, a second-generation mobster. As the police close in, Françoise and Simon go on the run together, pulling off occasional heists for operating money. Before long, they have also fallen in love.","popularity":1.166,"poster_path":"/mQpoNAJKWgVmYtVYDscWzxkc4x4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1742,"logo_path":"/kxKBr4UuwuVdMhuunZ579vWd5in.png","name":"Les Films 13","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1979-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Us Two","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":16}
