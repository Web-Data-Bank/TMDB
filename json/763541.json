The film provides an insider look into cutting edge laboratories in Japan and the USA where scientists attempt to make robots move, speak and look human. These scientists and their discoveries are contextualized with cinematic and pop culture references, to underline the mythic, comic and uncanny aspects of our aspiration to create machines that are eerily similar to ourselves.","popularity":1.534,"poster_path":"/ui0P0iLCoS18i5ajBLRJcXAaHtX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Childworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is a new era dawning for robotics?","title":"Origin of the Species","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
