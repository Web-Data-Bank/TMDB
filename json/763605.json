While his long-distance French boyfriend, Hadi, is visiting him, Cristi is called in for an intervention at a movie theatre, where an ultra-nationalist, homophobic group has interrupted the screening of a queer film. After one of the protesters threatens to out him, Cristi spirals out of control.","popularity":2.073,"poster_path":"/zUwZmWlBqGsR8Jcb8x4oSV3ujDM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43997,"logo_path":null,"name":"ICON production","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":143636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Picture Management","origin_country":""},{"id":143637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cutare Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2022-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poppy Field","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
