This presents the obscurity of our contemporary experience of presence. This piece draws reference to the alluring invitation to assume a fixed, bold and worn identity. Through this work, the body, heightened through dramatic symmetry and colour, speaks to not only connect with, but create crisp, gestural imprintsâ€¦..  The interaction of this crafted aesthetic with the environment hopes to capture modern day identity and an investigation into, a visual contemplation of presence. Ultimately this is less about experiencing and more about crafting and sharing through our technological platforms. The body is arrested; mimicking our often overlooked intrinsic abilities to connect in complete stillness, while the rest of our surrounds are breath-taking and in motion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9bgD18bsaDdNbDYArsEF3aEUCr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Non -","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
