Short clips shot on DS8mm are arranged in a tiled, grid-like structure that evokes the stacks of roofing slates once produced in the old quarry. The distorted drone and clattering slates of the soundtrack heighten the sense of a surreal and overbearing atmosphere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nct8JBwCvV7El8iFGnzH0QR9JC7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slate","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
