The film experiments with this legal document and personalizes the process. With this film I physically wrote out the words of my Will onto unexposed 35mm black and white film stock using a small pen light. I worked in complete darkness so that the only areas exposed to light are the areas physically touched by the light source.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pJOdEpejbUx0ay7VH4WJUPri6qi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Last Words","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
