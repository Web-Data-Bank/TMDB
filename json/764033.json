The 71 minute, Documentary Feature contains 15 chapters chronicling the epic successes and failures of this unprecedented journey. Each chapter focuses on a unique aspect of Canadian geography, culture and the exact mix of team-work and blind optimism required to pull off such a daring stunt.  Since it's release in 2010, A Canadian Dream (formerly \"DREAM\") has screened in theatres world-wide and, through it's proceeds, has allowed almost 100 children, from low-income homes, the opportunity to attend summer camp.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6OaeWY1UiQYJrCwbc8VTX1Q0XeG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129004,"logo_path":null,"name":"Above And Beyond Documentary Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Canadian Dream","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
