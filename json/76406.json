When Wenders visits Tokyo for the first time, he finds a very different city, one with a booming fascination with technology that often clashes with the traditional elements of Japanese culture. Wenders also interviews Ozu's cinematographer, Yuharu Atsuta, and Chishu Ryu, an actor who frequently collaborated with Ozu.","popularity":3.514,"poster_path":"/eBrrXzFRYA2AQIjNXkPA0KiEwWI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chris Sievernich Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":7951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grey City","origin_country":""},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":27992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wim Wenders Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":36229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wim Wenders Stiftung","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":45,"logo_path":"/tUkNOAjyTt9D56DUeQfmmAFvwYQ.png","name":"Road Movies","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo-Ga","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":63}
