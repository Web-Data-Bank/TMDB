From 1945 till 1946, he served in the U.S. Army and acted as a censor of mail to and from Nazi prisoners at the Nuremberg Trials. After the trials, Joseph succeeded as a humanities scholar and an educator - he settled in Columbus, Ohio, graduated from The Ohio State University, and taught French at Denison University until his retirement in 1990. But the past is not forgotten: Arnold talks about his unique experience of distant contact with the minds of people who were accused of war crimes against his own people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Censoring Nuremburg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
