Disoriented in this new landscape, Marcelo assumes that he will inherit the position left vacant by his mentor. What he doesn't expect is that Rafael Sujarchuk, a charismatic and pedantic philosopher trained in the best European universities, also covets the position. Between his multiple jobs as a philosophy professor in the local slums, at the university and privately with an 80-year-old millionaire, he must also prepare to run for office against this strong opponent who seems to have everyone on his side. Marcelo's clumsy efforts don't seem to be enough to get the job, but is that really what he wants?","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13449,"logo_path":"/jVqRkSBiksaZ1Qz4Y73dIbrlNkV.png","name":"PUCARÁ cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":75415,"logo_path":"/jnTkKFlcvMEDNBqE8nwWjP5QzwN.png","name":"PASTO","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":142214,"logo_path":"/16Z9JyKlyfQTdKxfGihK00oCLpQ.png","name":"Infinity Hill","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pandora Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":102468,"logo_path":"/7116YZNSKt5xKXgO9inx6bH0bq8.png","name":"Atelier de Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94506,"logo_path":"/pSTfyFTD439qICCIoycPg3LvVAU.png","name":"Kino Produzioni","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":166061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bubbles Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Puan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
