In 2020 the Reds finally lifted their 19th top-flight title and the club's first of the Premier League era. Jürgen Klopp's relentless team ended a three decade wait in the most emphatic fashion, notching numerous Premier League records along the way and winning the division by a massive 18 points. Amid all the joy on the pitch, sport and the football season were put starkly into perspective as the world went into lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet this was still a campaign for Reds' fans to savour, thanks to surely one of the greatest sides to call Anfield home. With the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup also added to the Anfield trophy cabinet, 2019-20 was a season that suggests Jürgen Klopp could be building a football dynasty to rival those of Liverpool FC's glorious past.","popularity":1.803,"poster_path":"/4hF3CvhLpma8MpKVLMwvrJKk5OO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":323,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Champions: Liverpool Football Club Season Review 2019-20","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
