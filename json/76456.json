In the last 57 years, the death toll has risen to the billions. Rick Walker, former fighter pilot turned disillusioned freelance flyer is hired to transport a mysterious woman to the site of a secret peace negotiation. Cynthia Perkins claims to be a special ambassador who was called upon in secrecy to bring the stalling negotiations back on track. On their way, Walker and Perkins are ambushed by a group of attack fighters and are forced to crash land on a remote planet called Nydenion. Their way to the peace negotiations becomes a fight against time and an enemy that seems to come from the ranks of their own military, an enemy that Walker knows all too well.","popularity":1.47,"poster_path":"/HC17sXUeUcn5NCL9RFEXD49wfY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magna Mana FX","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nydenion","video":false,"vote_average":3.885,"vote_count":13}
