One guy caught the ball, another guy ended up with it. Who is the rightful owner? The lawyers can't agree; the fans can't agree; even the wisened professors of property law can't agree. This is a story documenting the hilarious lengths to which someone will go for a baseball, and the few fans that will put their lives on hold for years, staking everything on one judge's decision.","popularity":0.696,"poster_path":"/AgGtlPWt6MDfOkjr7y2ybPQBuyk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up for Grabs","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
