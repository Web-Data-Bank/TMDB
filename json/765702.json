Members of the National Youth Council, including Duke Redbird and Harold Cardinal, have a powerful exchange with a hostile white priest about the failures of the education system in relation to Indigenous people. The group tackles issues including segregated residential schools, the denial of citizenship rights, loss of language, and mass incarceration, many of which persist or continue to be stumbling blocks in the relationship between Indigenous people and the Government of Canada today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fg7BKEnesEgFkbb3U7AQ8vdPspg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1967-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Powwow at Duck Lake","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
