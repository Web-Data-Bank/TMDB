He took them exactly at their word and served up a list that included the oldest-known English-language songs, a medieval Italian dance tune and various other folk songs alongside slightly more contemporary fare. The list was never published by Playboy; it was subsequently released into CD format. The songs comprising the track list cover a roughly thousand-year period, 1068â€“2001, starting with \"Sumer Is Icumen In\". The most recent song included on the album is Britney Spears' hit \"Oops!... I Did It Again\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yNQOnbVRKgK6BRBxNWpmGhfs4RQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beeswing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Thompson: 1000 Years of Popular Music","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
