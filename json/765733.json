A Graduate Film Student and fraternity member captured their journey on video as part of an academic documentary that was never meant to be shared outside of the fraternity. Weeks into the process, an early morning 911 call led Police to a high school football field, where they discovered the body of one of the Pledges. Months later, the damning footage from video cameras, cell phones and campus security cameras found its way to Director Rev. jeff obafemi carr, who amalgamated it into the explosive movie titled He Ain't Heavy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tDwMWtBBQEFbbgEasNrCpoGVvbv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143965,"logo_path":null,"name":"He Ain't Heavy Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pledge The Frat... if you dare.","title":"He Ain't Heavy: Pledging Underground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
