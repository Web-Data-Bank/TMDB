This is how the party where Ada, Rita and Marc celebrate one more night of their eternal youth is. They drink, dance and love each other, surrounded by their music and people. It begins to be hot; they have all the summer and all the life ahead of them. They are the future, the generation that joins together inclusion and narcissism, determination and uncertainty. The generation that wants to change the world while it collapses around them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9jENH7vAvV2DYuoivanQf9z3NWQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78523,"logo_path":"/tlptuYlIEOmXlb4PnuJXj6R4H3A.png","name":"Universitat Pompeu Fabra","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":84181,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banatu Filmak","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Catal√†"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La mugre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
