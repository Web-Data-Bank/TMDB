For many tears, Americans have been taught in our schools and universities that the founding of our Republic was the result of the Enlightenment from France, or from the deists of that time. But is that truly the case? Did the Enlightenment first declare no taxation without representation? Or trial by jury? were they the champions of free speech, or of the press? And why did Samuel Adams declare that the \"reign of political Protestantism\" would commence, just before signing the Declaration of Independence?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ue1JFJdN7K1EpxzEWSjoOz8NJ78.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adullam Films LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The True Christian History of America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
