A trip that should have remained a family mystery. The South and his grandfather open up a fascinating new world, a space in which a personal memory that immortalizes «El Cuco» can be created. A tribute by a grandson to the lost generation of the Franco dictatorship era, one which was not able to fulfill its dreams. A quest for the myth, and the sublime. A new writing of family history. A film that deals with the issue of borders. Borders between North and South, imagination and reality, present and past, grandfathers and grandsons, Spain and America, madness and lucidity","popularity":0.731,"poster_path":"/5OjUtjo158dyrzHS1i7uQCeULEf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life Sublime","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
