The city is still recovering from its past, as talk of sanctions and a possible American attack resonate. Using direct cinema methods, the film takes an intimate look at the way people live in this immense city today, caught up in the paradoxes and contradictions of their society, surrounded by images of past and future death, yet finding ways to juggle state propaganda and foreign threat on a daily basis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wiO5CgClSRTBE5skhmEGSZWnGFm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A People in the Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
