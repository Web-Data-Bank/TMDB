It marked the beginning of a new, post-communist era. At the start of the film, she calls out to people who had ever been lost on the beach in the nineties to get in touch with her. This seemingly random appeal leads to her traveling around the country and having conversations with a large number of peers about their memories of the experience, and about their life now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dBPCvy89lXW71ZVfJWO4tkL3HCf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2020-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Kids on the Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
