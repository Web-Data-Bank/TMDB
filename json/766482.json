Whereas American public institutions and art collectors have long ago established him as Warhol's successor, many Europeans still consider him only as an opportunist and an attention seeker. With his combination of the great entrepreneur's positive thinking, the freedom of Pop Art and perfectionism comparable to the masters of the past, Jeff Koons has undeniably succeeded in promoting the strategies of avant garde to the public. This film shows how he has reinvented his role as an artist into a media personality and the status his works enjoy with a number of collectors who have allowed him to fulfil his dreams. Through his art, his own words and those of friends, this world of seduction and reflection also reveals glimpses of a darker and a gloomier side.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hqjmDzEO4ANTvjKaA0h6sNOTSyD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141636,"logo_path":null,"name":"films media group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeff Koons: A Man of Trust","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
