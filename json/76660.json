Morality is the excuse for those who don't dare to live their truth.Michaela, Gabriela and Lucy are angels of vice. On their motorbikes they ride through the countryside to live their pleasure. They could see a lot, but only see themselves. They call themselves angels but they are angels with dirty wings. To be a full member in the exile paradise of angels, Lucy has to prove herself and stand the tests. The new film of Roland Reber and Mira Gittner is an anthem of immorality. A holy song of egoism and a painful study about our time and a generation who rent their feelings.","popularity":2.18,"poster_path":"/tl9F6hH8etXNkffXXp0y8f6UOat.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An anthem of immorality","title":"Angels with Dirty Wings","video":false,"vote_average":3.3,"vote_count":6}
