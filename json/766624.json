Sex with Mexicans can be very exciting and dangerous. The macho attitude makes aggressive and rude sex to be common not just between gay men but with straight men too. This dichotomy makes the Mexican men very special. The film is a combination of interviews, dance and scenes from an orgy that take us to a masculine homoerotic experience in traditional macho society in Mexico.","popularity":0.632,"poster_path":"/eoK5il1abdDluuzpxxb3NR85Lpj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antonio da Silva Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Machos","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
