They are snapshots of various situations and locations, as in this program of nine miniatures, shot in hotel rooms and parks, at the shore of a lake, and – in the longest contribution – on a restaurant terrace. Rousseau’s observations of everyday life, however, are about precision rather than contemplation. With each minute that passes, they sharpen the view of the observant and expectant outsider for a moment of surprise – be it a jump into the water or a huge crucifix.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yfREKbHZhxPy98CJUV8V2ou1pJ9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Partage des Eaux","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
