The authors slowly immerse viewers into multilayered space, where surrounding reality is dissolving, and so is human sight, which rediscovers\r itself on the border in searches of initial static point.\r Such creative exercises can also be marked by rather expected desire to arrange knowledge and understanding of cinematograph in contemporary context of visual communication and conversion of created work into completely different,\r unexplored quality of the art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nrmxwFeDHifIhE5eQodqphHlVk6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eternity is a child playingâ€¦ (Heracletus of Ephesus)","title":"Eternity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
