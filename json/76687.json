The dazzled audience erupts at the singer's knockout, Spanish-language openers, \"Y Hubo Alguien\" and \"Contra la Corriente,\" swoons to his exultant \"You Sang to Me,\" and hangs on every marvelous syllable in the exquisitely phrased \"When I Dream at Night.\" Anthony's material occasionally slides into bathos (\"That's Okay\"), but at his best he can go from big band salsa (\"Nadie Como Ella\") to Burt Bacharach-flavored pop-soul (\"My Baby You\") to gorgeous, breathless ballads (\"Da la Vuelta\") without breaking a sweat. But when he needs all engines firing at once, such as on his hot-hot-hot big hit, \"I Need to Know,\" the tension and power are delicious. Watching Anthony work a stadium crowd--gliding, dancing, playing to every corner--reminds one of Mick Jagger's playbook.","popularity":1.336,"poster_path":"/pzYEBLfznxJPgmQWWg1pW6c9spc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4375,"logo_path":"/eo8fJbkpiz9Wdsl1qDSEX4GXeZH.png","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marc Anthony: The Concert from Madison Square Garden","video":true,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":4}
