The piece is inspired by the oft-cited Matt Mahurin image made for a 1995 Time Magazine cover story on cyberporn, in which a man hugs a glowing computer. This simple gesture--embracing the device one spends so much time with--is cast in a sinister light, a deviation from normal desire. Twenty-five years hence, in a time when we touch and caress our devices all day long, heightened even further by quarantine, the desire to embrace our technologies seems normal and obvious.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f2QOmqgFiqgPSZCwCl2vttAGxAZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Touch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
