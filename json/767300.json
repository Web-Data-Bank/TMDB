A PERSONAL PROJECT is a series of online artifacts ranging from videos and erotic stories to photos and snapchats created to expose power dynamics in online, browser-mediated affairs. Who or what controls who's arousal? Who gets paid? Are there different kinds of currency used for pay-outs? Who gets what kind of currency-- is it all equal? Guilt and shame are explored as a possible substance that can be communicated through interface obfuscated online interaction. This project was exhibited in an account on XTUBE until 2019, an amateur porn site. nothing_fucking_matters_II: cuter on the internet.mp4 (2014) is an artifact from that XTUBE channel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lWBkhm9yNoSOJKs66nAIkSCa68L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"nothing_fucking_matters_II: cuter on the internet.mp4","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
