It portrays a colourful selection of 100+ year old people from all over the world. They have lived for over a century and witnessed great historical events, but instead of dwelling on the past, they look ahead. With the clock inevitably ticking, these centenarians cling to life, set new goals with a joie de vivre, refusing to admit the betrayal of their deteriorating bodies. Time is both their enemy and their friend. They have overcome diseases, lost partners and some of them survived their own children. Nevertheless, these active, curious and creative 100+ year olds are amazingly good at restarting every new day.","popularity":0.94,"poster_path":"/y1W6cEXgR2bGwaMaRc045IphGbS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch Mountain Film","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":7115,"logo_path":"/o2EG4i2JfK1o3EaXuaBKXo1PDlz.png","name":"Savage Film","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":95383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tenk.tv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Age is just a number","title":"100UP","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
