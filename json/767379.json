Apart from a few childhood photos, he himself remains out of the picture. He visits a teacher who used to take care of him, and a gay childhood friend. Their combined stories—about exclusion and terror, but also love—paint a portrait of a small, somewhat oppressive community and a boy who lost his sense of security within it, despite the help he was offered. In his wistful look at the past, Barreto transcends his personal experiences; anyone can identify with his bittersweet journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rqcAsHKGSs2gWUZTBh44xMbngCF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130077,"logo_path":"/e3wIhHj6U5wstsnHJSQb1mgtkkM.png","name":"Vulcana Cinema","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":1410,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAG/TRAUM Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"5 Houses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
