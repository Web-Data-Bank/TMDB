The Viceroy, king and queen must all sign the authorization. Too much time for such a vital wish. Stop-motion animated cutouts take us on the complex path of bureaucracy to accomplish a simple action. The landscapes change to the beat of the music for the story to move forward and grow just like that tree they wish to plant.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s3V0b8o42VlxFVncBQTNMv9f0T6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ire + Pipi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The tree has been planted","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
