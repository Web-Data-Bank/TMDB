American boxer, Darnell, his PR manager and girlfriend, Maria, troubled entrepreneur Adam and drug dealer Keith are forced to question their relationships and loyalties, as sinister secrets come to the fore, threatening dangerous consequences.  Unsettling and unexpected, this dark tale of lies and manipulation will lead audiences on a voyeuristic and ill-fated journey that, like the four characters, their sensibility may not want to be a part of, but their curiosity certainly will, begging the question: 'How do you weigh trust?'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tcj4KCDKo20q6O9u2XgUG7qWuKa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Do You Weigh Trust?","title":"Scales","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
