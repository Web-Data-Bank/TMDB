Their ethos is: “Where affairs of state are concerned, we cannot stand idly by and watch.” And yet the reward for their concern is a lifetime spent in political turmoil, years of periodic intimidation and surveillance. This film illustrates the perils of seeking freedom in a time of darkness, in a time when critique requires transformation. It depicts the harsh realities faced by three generations of activists—young, middle-aged and elderly– and allows us to better understand their anxieties, hopes, despairs and above all, their persistence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yxEugngAyx00HDpzw6ePpMgVapC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
