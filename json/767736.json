An experimental film about the pressure of conforming to the society. Accustomed to the standards, people are throwing judgment and prejudice against each other that squeeze them much harder towards the invisible walls. Hypocrisy is celebrated and thereâ€™s no room for moving and no space for breathing. Human senses may be the roots of all sins, but these senses are also the foundation of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6RlXHAFbUw8mfjjw7jSNN0SS06s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Turumpo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Human senses may be the roots of all sins, but these senses are also the foundation of life.","title":"Sins Senses Saints","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
