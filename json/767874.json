With this unlimited money, poor little \"Waffles\" nevertheless has only three desires: to buy the little restaurant for her old benefactor, Shorty Olson, to publish the music written by her lover, Carl Miller, a young, eccentric, absent-minded musical genius, and to adopt the baby that a Mrs. O'Shaughnessy is too poor to care for.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heiress at Coffee Dan's","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
