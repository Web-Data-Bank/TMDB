Using electronic music, upside-down plans and timed cuts, I wanted to convey a self-image of surreality and non-conformity with reality. The title, “Hades”, makes explicit reference to the God of Death and the Underworld in Greek mythology, and serves as a guide for the planned sensations of agony, pleasure, revelation and space-time detachment. This is how I see myself, this is how I think I should be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wdLBjAQvYLtOU57o7eQiIXaoyUd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Academia Internacional de Cinema","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hades","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
