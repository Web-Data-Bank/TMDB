The wolf convinces Red he is a police dog and he hastily beats a path to Grandma's house with intentions of making a meal of her. But Grandma's boyfriend shows up and takes her dancing. He then plans on eating Red, but the postman arrives with his draft induction notice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3287,"logo_path":"/bz6GbCQQXGNE56LTW9dwgksW0Iw.png","name":"Screen Gems","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Riding Hood Rides Again","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
