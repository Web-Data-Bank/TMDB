For five years the documentary production team Nā Maka o ka 'Āina (\"the eyes of the land\") captured on video the seasonal moods of Mauna Kea's unique 14,000-foot summit, the richly varied ecosystems that extend from sea level to alpine zone, the legends and stories that reveal the mountain's geologic and cultural history, and the political turbulence surrounding the efforts to protect the most significant temple in the islands: the mountain itself.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nā Maka o ka ‘Āina","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mauna Kea: Temple Under Siege","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
