One of the companies accused of sparking the opioid epidemic was Purdue Pharma – wholly owned by the philanthropic Sackler family – who have made billions from the sale of the drugs. But where were the medical regulators and government agencies that should have prevented this crisis?  This is a compelling insight into the growth of America’s devastating relationship with opioids that has destroyed millions of lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Addicted: America's Opioid Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
