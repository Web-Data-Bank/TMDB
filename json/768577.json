Having read a particularly lurid novel entitled Twin Souls recently, she arrives at the rehearsal wearing a daring gown in the hope of ensnaring a \"soul mate.\" Because of his poetic name, Caroline becomes involved with Reginald Van Alden, a married fortune-seeker. On the morning of the wedding, she abandons her old sweetheart, Bob Worth, to take a ride with Reginald, but when he takes her to a disreputable roadhouse, she escapes and then tries to commit suicide by drinking cologne.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yH3wuEmMJt4XNTFpUJwi2jve0fv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Path√© Exchange","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Could You, Caroline?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
