It was on this issue, through the divergent positions they took on the legitimization of the gulags, that their friendship broke. The screening of the film was an opportunity, for the first time and on a large scale, in the newspaper L’Humanité to get closer to Camus, until then reduced to the rank of anti-communist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n23MqxhfzohAsmdBAZX9elUPCnV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sartre/Camus, une amitié déchirée","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
