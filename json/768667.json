Performed at WildChild Productions in downtown San Diego sometime in 1991.  The all-star cast consisted of 16 performers divided into 4 teams, the team members all wore custom uniforms labelled with a number and a color.  This is a short edit of the performance that was made to accompany an installation piece for lalapalooza's traveling art tent. Unfortunately it doesn't convey the intensity of the show, a longer edit and all the original footage were lost, leaving this as the only document.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/smUSAAi7agdrVrVELb1VSF7AuOs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hyper-Mega Supercharged monster sex performance - complete with the world's first live burning-moster baby birth!","title":"Blood Pumpers Racing Club","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
