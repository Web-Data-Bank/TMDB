It is a chronicle of the life of a nomadic artist, constrained to immobility. It is an attempt to leave traces on ports, enclaves, deltas, borders, transformed into places of desolation and detention. A refugee is a person who resists disappearance. Alpha explores the world through his art. It is a journey between two journeys, between two worlds. It is a journey to overcome. It's a journey to end the flight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gxXnAce6EcNDy4U4sYJJCpbNool.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2020-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue House","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
