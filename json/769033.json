(Gottfried Benn)  Using tableau-like takes of different places of the Muscovite suburb (Moskatchka), a poor quarter of the Latvian capital Riga, the film shows fragments of the choreography of life and combines them to form a picture of reality. Without making any comments, the camera observes the people’s behaviour, which reminds you of the early Flaherty and how his camera “stuck to” his film heroes . It also reminds you of the beginning of film art when the recording of reality on a strip of film was an event, in spite of its accidental character.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/td3SKdxWbT5ivyrAkL5SdNQ5iY0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kino Kombat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":93609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screen Vision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2004-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moskatchka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
