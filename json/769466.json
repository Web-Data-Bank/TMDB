They survive the attack, but when they leave the theatre, they are no longer the same. That night leaves a deep scar on both their lives and each tries to cope with the aftermath as best they can. Céline desperately tries to leave the events behind her, clinging to her previous life, while Ramón repeatedly goes back to that night, trying to remember and understand what happened. Nonetheless, they both face the same key question: how to reconnect and move on together?","popularity":6.248,"poster_path":"/d3CkmiEyroLU548nbXqnwVwmScc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27628,"logo_path":"/8rluD2KhZHZbEOiAKW5qbBxyD0R.png","name":"Bambú Producciones","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":694,"logo_path":"/5LEHONGkZBIoWvp1ygHOF8iyi1M.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7792,"logo_path":"/72Dyvk7Xo4m6uxRNpe52PxT5BrK.png","name":"Noodles Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":31890,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Termita Films","origin_country":""},{"id":126568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mr. Fields and Friends","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Year, One Night","video":false,"vote_average":6.326,"vote_count":23}
