A place governed by its own codes and order, where unwritten rules are more powerful than the written word. In the making of the film, the production team witnessed a gamut of attitudes and emotions. Much can be understood from the youths’ gestures, facial expressions and from their actions. Secretive and uncommunicative, they are victims, yet perpetrators of crime. But, also still children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8cA4P5W3gje3DIvgEBnCl7jIMX1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85188,"logo_path":"/dt6pAG7kCbPrzwcp92NMxTGJyLJ.png","name":"Juris Podnieks Studio","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2010-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Wire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
