The musicalâ€™s unconventional structure unfolds as Cathy tells her story in reverse, from the end of their turbulent relationship, whilst Jamie tells his story chronologically from the spark of their initial meeting. The two characters meet only once, at their wedding in the middle of the show. Now, this iconic musical returns to London in a bold new actor-musician production with the actors on stage at all times and playing the piano to add a new narrative dimension to the story, accompanied by a four piece band.","popularity":0.61,"poster_path":"/7K4WQLBc3ycMu013hsnCKGiYqBt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southwark Playhouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Five Years","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
