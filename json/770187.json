McLaren opens up to director (and sometime neighbour) Simon Mark-Brown about his life and inspirations â€” plus his decision to live off the grid, only venturing back to Auckland to replenish vital supplies. Mark-Brown partially shot the documentary during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown, and its theme of self-isolation is especially resonant in pandemic times. Mark-Brown's CV includes feature The Catch and wine documentary A Seat at the Table.","popularity":0.868,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":144734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Republic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2020-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of one man, and one tiny island","title":"The Man on the Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
