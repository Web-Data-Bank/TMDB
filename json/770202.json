Photography was still in its infancy when he opened his first studio in Montreal in the late 1850s. He rapidly turned his art, and a budding technology, into a highly successful business. Within 5 years he was appointed Photographer to the Queen. Not content with doing mere portraiture, he saw photography as a means of documenting history. With the use of props in his studio, composite photographs, and calling on his background as a trained artist, Notman immortalized the people and places of Canada.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kkp1gyBb7F3jq47Z652CxG5nXlB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notman's World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
