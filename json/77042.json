They did not study at institutes, do not speak foreign languages, do not understand politics and consider the words “Internet” and “glamor” as curses. For such words, they can give in the face. They see life mainly on the TV screen. Yes and that - black and white.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/97mLP02ckYS5VSghJgF3C86iK2D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2010-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Beat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
