Unfortunately the implementation is simply not good enough. As so often with Danish movies, there is little appreciation for detail thus leaving us with hoodlums talking like they've done time at a business academy rather than a prison. Dialects completely out of here and idiosyncratic bikers without bikes or even character for that matter. An ever accelerating surrealism towards the end doesn't help to clear the slow pace of this film but it does give a glimpse of what the story could have unfolded to become.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An ever accelerating surrealism towards the end","title":"Portland","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":7}
