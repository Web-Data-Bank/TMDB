The film tells the story of two former circus performers who meet years later inside a shared memory, where they try to discover what sent them off in different directions from a love that seemed so total and so complete. It is an attempt at cinematic poetry, with music, poetic language, and resonant imagery meeting non-linear storytelling. Meg & Siggy Go Swimming features Porscha Shaw in the role of Meg. It was written and directed by Jeffrey Frac√©, shot and edited by Kwame Braun, with music by Christian Frederickson.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/afTr08P7qwu5oDpDJf9Nmp8mLwU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meg & Siggy Go Swimming","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
