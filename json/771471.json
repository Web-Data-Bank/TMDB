Embedded in contemporary Mexico, it discusses the logic of revenge - an omnipresent topic since the beginning of the drug war in 2006. The protagonists of the film are not characters of the play, but tell the story as witnesses, bystanders and neighbours. They do not take part in the events of the play, but are affected by its consequences. In their reflections and commentaries on the play, the fictitious story blurs with their experiences and the present situation in Camino Verde, one of the poorest and most violent districts of Tijuana.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t6D62OqbR8syojnb8xhUyE80go.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2015-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tito","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
