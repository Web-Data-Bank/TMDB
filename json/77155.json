Before they crash they shoot the weapon like a torpedo from the ship to some location on Earth. There is only one survivor of the crash, the least intelligent of the crew, who before they were attacked was using a highly advanced mop to clean the floor. He must locate the Deathsphere before the Ghastorians do. He gets confused for someone else and becomes part of a group having a beach party while the Deathsphere gets mistaken for a volleyball which some young people play with. The Maltrusian alien along with the Deathsphere go off with a group that separates from the party to go up to the mysterious abandoned house of the deceased Mr. Willoughby.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t5zf9rU2rXWqWMsTlWNFiaOTCPH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Find the Death-Sphere, Dr. Bateman...","title":"Alien Beach Party Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
