Visions follow one another in this horror-style short, with a polished aesthetic mixing black and white costumes, shoulder camera shots in a dense dark forest, and an ominous children’s song. The forest appears as a prison hiding one’s most personal fears, anthropomorphized in seemingly inescapable apparitions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hC9a8Ch2asLCSjJLutbLLwRT8mD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144987,"logo_path":null,"name":"Synesthetic Bali Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creatures of the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
