(..)  This is a film with an almost entirely African cast, depicting an African teacher instructing a group of African students, produced by a predominantly African crew. Yet, the subject of the film – encouraging the widespread teaching of English – jars with this image of a modern Gold Coast. Just as the Gold Coast Film Unit was overseen by British figures – such as Sean Graham and, in this case, George Noble – this film also endorses the retention of British influence within a new national identity'. - Tom Rice, for colonialfilm.org","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uYhq0tG8p2W1g13I3gob2VJIwOi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gold Coast Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GH","name":"Ghana"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1954-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Will Speak English","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
