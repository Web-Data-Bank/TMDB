A chief minister who used his position to smash the Roman Catholic church in England and loot the monasteries for his own gain. A man who used torture to bring about the execution of the woman who had once been his friend and supporter - Anne Boleyn.  Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford University, reveals a very different image of Cromwell.  He describes Cromwell as an evangelical reformer, determined to break the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church and introduce the people of England to a new type of Christianity in which each individual makes direct contact with God.","popularity":1.099,"poster_path":"/w25mR3trOYzVMcLFSobC0aDXqOr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Henry VIII's Enforcer: The Rise and Fall of Thomas Cromwell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
