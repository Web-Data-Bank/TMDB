For the sake of order, the head teacher of the same school, Maria Genrikhovna, is traveling with them. Tanya is not enthusiastic about the boss's eye, but Maria Genrikhovna quickly breaks all stereotypes about head teachers. In her face, Tanya finally finds herself a worthy adult - either a role model, or a mother, or a mentor. Meanwhile, the festival insistently demands a return to reality - the organizers demand to change the name of the performance, the poster, and, preferably, the worldview. Choose the path of compromise for the sake of children or take a principled position? In any case, Tanya and Maria Genrikhovna will have to answer to twelve teenagers who are experiencing their first dramas at the festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15755,"logo_path":"/cZDbkvJPOnzHlmu2CDx05DcEnaf.png","name":"Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":165805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forrest Film","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":84882,"logo_path":"/9clAUmAsWbsAS4Xua4e861dkoZ9.png","name":"Aamu Film Company","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":125613,"logo_path":"/llbR8dccO5UlzJ3x1gzdQWmOuuS.png","name":"Kinoprime Foundation","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Holidays","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
