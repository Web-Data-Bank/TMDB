This enthusiast is Mitya. He is 18. And he keeps a vow of silence. In the world of Mitya's ideas, everything is harmonious and understandable exactly until the energetic trickster Kowalski joins him with his girlfriend, the charming but dependent on him Polina. With new friends, the movement is rapidly gaining momentum: and now young people are already launching an ambitious campaign to save the old greenhouse building from demolition. But the further, the more complex the intertwining relationship within the trinity. And the spark that flared up between Mitya and Polina intensifies the already insoluble ideological dispute between the guys. When the rally on the day of the demolition finally gets out of control, Mitya will have to finally decide what is more important for him - people or monuments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/91ymSNdvrkfHuRdqqugezqfs8vo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15755,"logo_path":"/cZDbkvJPOnzHlmu2CDx05DcEnaf.png","name":"Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":42673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rock Films","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mittelmarsch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
