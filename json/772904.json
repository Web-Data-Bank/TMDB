A girl appears and holds up a red piece of paper with the words \"A woman who should never have been given a name in the first place\" written on it. From this point on, a dozen or so high school students act out a play and a flood of words using the red drawing paper begins, and a spy drama proceeds simultaneously. The film is an homage to Godard and Kurosawa Kiyoshi, and is notable for its forceful narrative, which seems to want to destroy the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tBCmH8Ly0POfsddXkmnggFuLoeu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT MOVIE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
