The central basis of the documentary is the content of the documents and the amazing story they tell â€“ a different approach. This program is not a rehash of the old Roswell crash scenarios, providing evidence that the first U.S. crash was in Missouri in 1941.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xi5xaKxJepAvEijBGfpZ9hNa5lQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UFO - The Secret, Evidence We Are Not Alone","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
