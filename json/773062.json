Through the use of intuitive editing, music, image overlays, and public domain cartoons, Alaska demonstrates the complicated, wonderful, and sometimes terrifying force childhood trauma can have on your life. Over the course of 13 original tracks, as well as humorous interstitials, Josh Deane explores moments of freedom, shame, the absurd horror of growing up in an evangelical cult, and the loneliness of losing a sister. Instead of utilizing narrative, Alaska uses dream logic and imagery to create a compelling, and at times overwhelming, emotional experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145128,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sacred Ash Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Alaska is a dreamlike experimental musical made from seven decades of home movies.","title":"Alaska","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
