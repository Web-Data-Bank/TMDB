Now, amidst a global health crisis, the cruel weaponization of vote-by-mail restrictions has turned the constitutional right to vote into a choice between life and death.","popularity":0.608,"poster_path":"/zAVICoc1HtArN3F2TtgKw3e8oHo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4971,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brave New Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suppressed 2020: The Fight to Vote","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
