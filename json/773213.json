Carry a bag with money for the rescue of his wife's kidnapping. Wait for the timely signal to act. The trips are made to corroborate that there is no police observing. He is a single man. These journeys are useless, erratic. The landscape of the suburbs of a border city is something new, unknown to him. As distant and different as the Arctic.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/ghgAwh2aaWvJGhWpcjlpBe5lQir.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2010-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
