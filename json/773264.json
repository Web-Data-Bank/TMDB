This film features long audio/visual takes of settings in Brighton, UK; Plymouth, UK; London, UK; Windsor, Ontario; Toronto, Ontario; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Detroit, Michigan. In many cases, the shots seem to have the effect of functioning as “establishing shots”—suggesting that a story is about to unfold. But the viewer soon realizes that the story is inferred in the structure—and the narrative remains largely elusive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b5Q0KIahBBWjtdc6jPbSFwF5OXk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There for a While and Then Gone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
