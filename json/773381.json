LGBT people, whom the ruling party chose to be the enemy, became the target of an intense campaign of power supported by the church and public media officials. The breakthrough came on August 7 - the day the LGBT community said enough, demonstrating on the streets of Warsaw in defense of one of them - activist Margot. On that day, the power of rainbow solidarity clashed with brutal police aggression. There were high-profile, show arrests, as a result of which 48 participants of the protest were arrested. Among them are the protagonists of Micha≈Ç Bolland's shocking film - Kajetan, Kamila, Krem and Julia and her partner.

And what was the situation of the LGBT rights movement? Sometimes called the Polish Stonewall, August 7 may go down in history.","popularity":0.616,"poster_path":"/7aRPZynFsyOGGY8PcScLjv9UE4q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"lgbt Poland","title":"7th of August","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
