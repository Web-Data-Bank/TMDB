Kansas educators and scientists organize a worldwide boycott of the hearings, which some say confuses the issues. Participating school board members admit they don't believe in evolution at the outset and some admit they don't understand the science presented by the witnesses. All witnesses brought in by Intelligent Design Network. Film shows both sides with in-depth, revealing interviews and 3-camera coverage of the hearings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xU7YSGATNbrolr3OfX5Z4UYlpP5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kansas vs. Darwin","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
