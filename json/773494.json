But statistics never tell the whole story. Sex Spirit Strength follows Michael and Jack, two young Indigenous men, as they shed the stigma and shame associated with their sexual health and gender identity. Michael, a former addict who lived a high-risk lifestyle that left him with permanent scars, hopes his activism work will discourage other young people from going down the same path. Jack, a transgender gay man, is committed to bringing pride back to two-spirit identity through education and activism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wP9atOa96MQfWiAiDroZhvZi66L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex Spirit Strength","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
