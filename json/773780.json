The body weight of a newborn child is up to 85 percent water, but in adulthood, the ratio can be cut into half. In a way, people dry up as they grow older. In Claudia Tosi’s documentary, people drink water, watch the rain and wait for their death. The Perfect Circle depicts a man and a woman, Ivano and Meris, who spend their final days at a hospice in the hills of Reggio Emilia, Northern Italy. Their illnesses are in the terminal stage and they know that death is only a matter of time. But the ever-nearing end may fleetingly be forgotten, like when they close their eyes and get lost in the music – until the bodies being carried out next door once again remind them of the inevitable. Death also becomes a part of life for the patients’ loved ones, who want to spend the last available moments with the soon to be departed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u2SOyTAZVbUb0qqiO1JqWbynf3i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movimenta","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":109096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Petra Pan Film Production","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":20961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miafilm","origin_country":""},{"id":52190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cobos Films B.V.","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Perfect Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
