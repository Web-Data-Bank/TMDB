What experiential, political or aesthetic contingencies do we bring to both the making and viewing of a cinema that contains the human form? If a body is different from our own – in terms of gender, skin color, or age – do we frame it differently?  How does looking at a body on screen make us feel?  At CCA, New York filmmaker Lynne Sachs will guide her audience through her own evolution as a filmmaker by sharing excerpts from her own films.  In this way, she will explore the fraught and bewildering challenge of looking at the human form from behind the lens.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Body, Your Body, Our Bodies: Somatic Cinema at Home and in the World - an Expanded Cinema Screening and Talk by Lynne Sachs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
