In the absence of adequate policing, acts of violence have escalated to the point where some residents have taken the law into their own hands. This increase in lawlessness resulted in the murder of Donald Findlay in the Halifax County Correctional Centre 90 minutes into serving a 14-day weekend sentence for dangerous driving.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":145241,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triad Film Productions Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle for Moser River","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
