But that did not deter him from making movies. Currently, he's in post-production on the second film he's done since being diagnosed. He's driven by the message of his late friend, the maestro Akira Kurosawa: \"Movies have the power to stop fighting. Look 400 years ahead and keep on shooting.\" We follow Obayashi's extraordinary career and his mission to use the big screen to send out a message of peace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mt1qnNGv1s6SpYte5Fy2wXhY2LR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film Director Nobuhiko Obayashi: His Promise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
