Axtell Morris (1900-1945) accompanied her husband Earl on archaeological excavations, including in Canyon de Chelly, Aztec Ruins and Mesa Verde, as well as the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.  The film is an historical drama shooting on location in New Mexico, Arizona, and the Yucatan in Fall 2020. Axtell Morris was married to Earl Halstead Morris - a primary inspiration for Indiana Jones.  She is sometimes credited as the “co-discoverer” of the Anasazi or Ancestral Puebloan culture, although Southwestern Natives might well dispute that terminology.","popularity":2.021,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canyon Del Muerto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
