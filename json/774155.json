He is torn between the tragicomic routine of an opera house and his own perception of Wagner and the Ring cycle. The film witnesses the director’s drama in maintaining the fragile link between a well-constructed performance and his own vision that lies within the music and the narrative, and is seen as German expressionism-like nightmares.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kSjql1AglpajYHcwJiK9EOGbEPa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34804,"logo_path":"/sdu4YsenhKo5Jax4XHU0dxNQTXT.png","name":"Locomotive Productions","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2009-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valkyrie Limited","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
