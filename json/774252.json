For Flore, love is a total commitment. A film that speaks about love, bonding, and personal development. Throughout the film, the characters, a little offbeat and with emotional baggage, seek to understand each other and try with difficulty to communicate. Flore, with all her tenderness, her anger, and her constant need to talk. Philippe, the one who needs silence. Julien, the one who is never there. Anna, the one who won’t settle down.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j5pvxCmQ7bCqgOCyA8RBbcvtayb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unraveling Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
