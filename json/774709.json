With echoes of Mexico’s Day of Dead festivities, the work is a moving and irreverent celebration of his father’s tumultuous life, and touches on a pervasive reluctance in Western culture to confront the shadow of death.  \"The Snowman was a chance to wind up a visual conversation with my dad that began a long time ago. He was, and remains, a big presence in my life, even now that he’s gone. Despite the sadness, making the work and looking back at the material, was incredibly rewarding - the experience was unexpectedly life-affirming.\" Zadoc Nava","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Snowman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
