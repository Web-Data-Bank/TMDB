While Unit 3’s cops are full of ambition and talent, they never seem to crack a case. The team is comprised of Detective Koh, a 15 year veteran, Detective Kim (Min-jun Kim), a rookie eager to make a name for himself, Detective Koh, a married man who spends more time on the job than with his wife, and Detective Ryung ( Sang-mi Nam ), who can’t get taken seriously by her peers because she’s a woman. While at a party with his girlfriend, Kim happens upon information about a drug deal that could get the team the respect they’ve been looking for. But what the team gets into turns out to be not just a big drug bust, but a case that makes Homicide Unit 3 the target of the largest drug lord in Korea .","popularity":1.67,"poster_path":"/aW9IoFjWzBoEQfCdGzx4efisvMw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105365,"logo_path":null,"name":"씨네넷","origin_country":""},{"id":7819,"logo_path":"/ghFZAt4edln0M7BzDExyYMzUGX1.png","name":"Lotte Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2005-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never to Lose","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":17}
