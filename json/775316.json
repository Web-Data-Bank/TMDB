In order to get the family car, Ģirts lies and says he is going fishing, so his parents compel him to take his younger brother along. Ģirts’ friend backs out, and he is forced to go fishing after all. Bitter about the failed plan, Ģirts is mean, but his brother’s joy over the first fish caught is a self-revelation of his pervasive injustice towards his younger brother. As a gift, Ģirts shows him the secret entrance to Potassium Park. The brothers head off on an exciting foray through the abandoned and mysterious structures, until they accidentally uncover a box of explosives that tests their newly-developed camaraderie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ikeiWXVIFOcYpoDW45Vist542IU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91036,"logo_path":null,"name":"FA Filma","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2015-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Case in Potassium Park","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
