Harassment, mental violence, manipulation, cornering – these topics are current in both politics as well as private sphere. In these nightmarish confrontations, dramatics, mysticism as well as twisted comedy can be found.  The third short film “Agreement” by Andres Maimik and Rain Tolk takes the viewer to the middle of the chaos of a film set.
