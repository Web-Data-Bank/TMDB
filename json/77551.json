But unknown to them, the family inheritance has passed from grandmother to granddaughter for centuries-and Rebecca has a long reach from the grave to assure that the line is unbroken. The first weekend in the mansion is a party for the three Naiberts and their friends-but one by one, they vanish without a trace. Is death the punishment for violating Rebecca's spell? Are the demons that beset the young people real-or only reflections of their own fear? Is it murder, violence from another dimension, or madness? The answer lives in the reflections.","popularity":0.863,"poster_path":"/ieXjXRLoOLXg2WmvByzaXtwbbVt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passing","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":5}
