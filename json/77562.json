They start producing one box-office failure Z-movie after the other, all with terribly bad local non-pros as actors. Covered in debts, they finally have their great chance, when a local nobleman obsessed by magic decides to invest all his wealth in the making of a movie about Cagliostro, just one year after Orson Welles' Black Magic (1949). They hire a famous American actor (Robert Englund) and start shooting \"The Return of Cagliostro\".","popularity":2.365,"poster_path":"/n7W2WbHSXUTkjTxl7pys0ACFHck.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinico Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":317,"logo_path":"/HJj0J9Tk6AGcLpL4O7mI3bsccM.png","name":"Istituto Luce Cinecitt√†","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2003-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Cagliostro","video":false,"vote_average":7.763,"vote_count":19}
