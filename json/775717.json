Another year with no one to kiss under the mistletoe. Of course, it doesn’t help that after her last epic breakup, Holly hopped into the sack with the one man she should’ve avoided. Her arch-rival, Dean Pritchard. Despite the fact that he didn't bother calling after their night together, she can't get him out of her head. When a snowstorm traps the two of them in an elevator, Holly can't avoid her work crush any longer.
