A world of contrasts – pioneers placing flower chaplets to Lenin’s monument and Scott McKenzie “If you’re going to San Francisco, be sure to wear flowers in your head”. First Estonian beat-bands were born already in the early 60’s. Names like “Juuniorid”, “Rütmikud”, “Optimistid”, “Mikronid”, “Kristallid”, “Virmalised” and a lot of others, not so well known, performed almost every week on youth dance-nights. The repertoire was mainly acquired by listening and recording music from foreign radio stations with the static noise of the radio. Radio Luxemburg and a lot of other radio stations playing new music, like Radio Caroline and Radio Sweden, became windows to the music world. On 28 April, 1968, the Puhkeparkide Direktsioon and Tallinn Beat Club organized the first festival-like youth music event in Estonia and in whole Soviet Union.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kosmos 68 - Legends vol 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
