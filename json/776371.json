Purportedly representing the Red Army carrying Malevich’s ‘Black Square’, the photo allows for varying narratives, interpretations and hopes. Mingling archival footage with digital renders, \"July Days\" brings together a chorus of voices that explore what such a photo can represent in an age of fake news and virality. In the process, \"July Days\" invites its viewers along a hopeful and intimate reading of (art) history that celebrates the potential of radical imagination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"July Days","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
