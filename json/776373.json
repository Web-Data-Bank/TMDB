Mirza Abdul-Qader Bidel (Bidel Dehlavi) was born in 1644 in (Azim Abad) Penta, India. The themes of his poems are influenced by multitudes of philosophies including Hindu, Sufi and Islamic traditions. Following the ideas of Ebn al-ʿArabī, he considered air (an aspect of nafas-e Raḥmānī, the breath of the Compassionate) to be the foundation of the world and spirit. Everything else –minerals, plants, animals –are viewedas the product of nature, which itself emerged from a single word brought into being through the articulation of “the breath of the Compassionate”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xK6tjGF8PszAEf5fDv2qZUPbCzG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghazal no 884 By Bidel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
