My generation became experts in the art ofdisappearances and denials followed by ignominious returns. My memory is fatally fractured, it divides and subdivides and disintegrates, but never outgrows its causes.\" Sandra Johnston.  Negotiating personal and historical narratives in relation to sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, \"That Apart\" extends an ongoing collaboration between performance artist Sandra Johnston and filmmaker Richard Ashrowan. Compiled from a five-day encounter inside a bare gallery at the Project Arts Centre, Dublin, a seriesof singular actions and gestures evolve, transitional moves that Johnston describes as an ‘autopsy of performative gestures’ from her 27 years of practice. Performing directly for camera, a solitary, exacerbated relationship to the artist’s body emerges.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l3XZOc7V77SlJhzG35sQBG6Tca5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2019-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Apart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
