This review, written in 1959 by critic and poet Edwin Denby, articulates the music and movement of a dance using an idiosyncratic stream of metaphors. \"Tha-at’s right\" takes these outlandish descriptions literally by using them as a script or score, translating the written word back into a performance. This process was realised collaboratively with the performers onscreen over the course of a day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pnjErwPGlG3EaaQDTQ6mhsWV9D5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tha-at's right","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
