The film considershow they can function at extreme depths and pressure within challenging conditions such as highly acidic, high temperature, high radiation, low oxygen and methane heavy environments. Through sci-fi narratives, the film exposes non-human and multi-species perspectives, hidden networks and unheard voices.
