Using CGI, live-action and music, Disco Islamappropriates the aesthetics of the world of advertising and commerce in order to shed a light on issues created by the implementation of neo-liberal policies in the Middle East and the dystopian techno-capitalist solutions towards them. By juxtaposing fact and fiction throughout the film, \"Disco Islam\" ultimately pictures an apocalyptic vision of the Middle East in which the market ideology of free-trade and boundless profit-making has resulted in economic injustices, environmental catastrophes and the abandonment of the humanist project in Iran.","popularity":0.609,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disco Islam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
