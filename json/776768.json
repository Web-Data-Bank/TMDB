Although from distant moments in history, the protagonists are both figures indicative of ritual gathering created by Essex communities. Within the work the figures hover in cultural/historical flux, a state of simultaneous belonging and alienation as they pass through and around places seemingly suspended on the edge of conventional time and space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/krVHCS8LplApnDqsepS27dvWXZB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(study for) Swedge of Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
