Hosted by Roger Moore. In the Footsteps of the Holy Family traces the journey of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph after Christ’s birth, visiting the sites made sacred by their presence. A compelling blend of history, science and faith, it examines everything from the fate of the three Magi to a spectacular vision of the Virgin Mary at Zeitoun, Egypt, in 1968, offering a fresh look at one of the most important chapters in human history.","popularity":0.961,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18441,"logo_path":"/rJmXT9sgCKG8uSUO1T93kOTfAzm.png","name":"A+E Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Footsteps of the Holy Family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
