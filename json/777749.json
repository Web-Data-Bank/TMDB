Based on the book “Shanghai 1937: Stalingrad on the Yangtze” by Danish author Peter Harmsen, this film introduces key figures in the conflict, chronicles how the battle unfolded over the course of three months, and explores the aftermath and years of war that followed.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/oVy8gz2BYT6iDJJYrgk0La6XSlU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradox Communications","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shanghai 1937: Where World War II Began","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
