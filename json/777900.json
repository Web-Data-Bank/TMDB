They became known as the richest people in the world.  Mainstream America read in national publications about how the Osage squandered their money.  The Osage Allotment Act provided the opening many whites needed to cheat the Osage out of their wealth.  Under the Act, white guardians were appointed and then proceeded to rob their wards.  Scams, robbery and even murder went un-investigated.  After all, the Osages did nothing to earn their riches.  The silence of decades has done little to relieve the suspicion and enmity between the Osage and their white neighbors.  No one talks about it; or even acknowledges that it happened.  The Osage people want this story told so that we donâ€™t forget that racism and corruption are still powerful forces in 21st century America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of how the Osage became known as the wealthiest people in the world, and how they were murdered for their money.","title":"Osage Murders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
