Documentary  2018  combines  these  stories  into  a  unique  poetic  vision  based  on  analogy  with  the  documentary  235  000  000,  a  classic  of  the  Riga  school  of  poetic  documentary  cinema.  This  film  is  an  attempt to make sure whether the codes of the poetic cinema are still relevant and accessible today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bPtTzgluxsVDuGdd4ftRDdTr7qP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2018","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
