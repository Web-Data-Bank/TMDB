In a moment of desperation, her womanhood coming to the fore, she calls on Father Sullivan, the good priest at the monastery, who soothes her hysteria and tries to show her the path of rectitude. Jackson pursues his prey into the very walls of the monastery, and triumphantly brings Cynthia back with him.

Filled with holy awe, the priest enters the gilded den of vice and calls on Cynthia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Conflict","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
