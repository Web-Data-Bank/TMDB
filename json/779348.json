This is the same age when you are not an adult, but also not small. It was in this, the last summer of childhood, that everything fell on Artyom at once: the betrayal of his father, who remained abroad after the tour, first love, friendship forever and quarrel forever. Artyom has only a skateboard - this is how in the 80s in the USSR they called skate, which Soviet teenagers had just begun to learn about. Now Artyom needs only one thing: by all means to win in street competitions.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/xwKQhq6ttlSAjRA1P4KKcvJojvB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vita Aktiva","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asphalt Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
