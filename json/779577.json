A transvestite is a definition in itself, a person at a crossroads with incredible vital strength, of which by their very ambivalence they are the synthesis. An artist and at the same time the tool for their art. This documentary follows those artists who talk about theirs lives and problems in São Paulo, Brazil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uqIeKxH2cqAniQvxq0jU1ntAuxU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1987-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Douleur d'amour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
