Break explores the transmuting relationship of ice and water in the north Atlantic off Iceland's coast, through varying shots of a single act: glacial ice fragments violently struck by breaking waves in a stormy ocean. Images and field recordings of the ocean's relentless force paired with Spiegel's unsettling, otherworldly score evoke the troubling effects of an unseen human presence. Break is a meditation on the passage of time and fragility of matter. With powerful imagery and sound, its visual commentary alludes to inexorable loss and dissolution and infers the implications of a changing climate in the far north, and beyond.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Break","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
