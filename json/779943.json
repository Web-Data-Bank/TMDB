Their faces and names were systematically erased 3,500 years ago to obliterate their memory. Today, an international scientific team restores his memory investigating the necropolis of Dra Abu el-Naga in Luxor. The tomb of Djehuty and his unique version of the Book of the Dead are the starting point for an adventure filled with new characters, valuable finds, astounding discoveries and unusual shots of the work carried out on the site by egyptologists, archaeologists, anthropologists and restorers.
