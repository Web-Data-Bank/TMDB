On trial for claiming she'd spoken to God, Jeanne d'Arc is subjected to inhumane treatment and scare tactics at the hands of church court officials. Initially bullied into changing her story, Jeanne eventually opts for what she sees as the truth. Her punishment, a famously brutal execution, earns her perpetual martyrdom.","popularity":11.618,"poster_path":"/8OYGtQlO8k9PcOm49apV62eVJQo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société générale des films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1928-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Immortal Screen Classic that will live Forever!","title":"The Passion of Joan of Arc","video":false,"vote_average":8.055,"vote_count":778}
