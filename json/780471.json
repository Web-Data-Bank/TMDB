But as this short documentary from the Northern Film School reveals, David has darker, more profound reasons to spend so much time in the shed. Following a terrible accident and several weeks in a coma, David fights his fears day-in, day-out: polishing, fixing and rebuilding, finding his way through the darkness. A documentary film from Yorkshire about life, death, and bicycles; a film about what pushes us beyond.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":115476,"logo_path":"/wCR7E1paoQrlE4RztjafCqTRhZM.png","name":"Northern Film School","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A man's obsession with bicycles brings light to his dark, complicated past.","title":"Man On Bike","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
