Jacky Connolly turns her filmmaking practice towards a mysterious group home in the virtual American South. Several avatars live in three small buildings near the town's railroad yard, where their lives are punctuated by hours spent in front of a screen. Images from elsewhere begin to intrude with mounting intensity, as the boundaries of the film are fractured by the characters’ visual and auditory hallucinations. These moments of psychosis give insight into the characters’ shared histories, as well as the dissociative atmosphere of their cultural landscape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vXMDp0iKKHdn7CibdAFgxCP3yv1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anhedonia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
