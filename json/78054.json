Stanley Cox and LeRoy Stanton sell this land to settlers who arrive to find it bone dry, as a dam on the McCall ranch controls the water. Among the settlers are John Dawson and his daughter Connie. The latter goes to the nearest town to take action, but Sheriff Ball tells him there is nothing he can do. Tim falls for Connie but Mike is unimpressed with her charms. While returning from a town dance, Tim discovers Stanton trying to dynamite the dam, and is killed in the ensuing gunfight. Stanton later sends his men to stampede the cattle while he and Cox blow up the dam. Despite the efforts of Mike and Sheriff Ball, the cattle are wiped out and Mike races to the dam and kills Stanton in a gunfight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5v79uCL83bCGa9RENdMrAdoMGPp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allied Artists Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":31153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scott R.
