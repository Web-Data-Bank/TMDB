He earned his living in God knows what way, but once he boldly boasted that he and a confederate was to rob a house. She pleaded with him to forsake the dishonest plan, but he laughed and hurled her aside. She sobbed and begged, but he merely enjoyed her tears, and left the house. Outside he met his accomplice. The little wife followed him, caught up with him on the corner, and again pleaded with him to return home. In his rage he turned and struck her on the head. The woman fell and did not rise again. The two ran off. A little later she was found lying there by a farmer and his wife, who revived her. She did not know who or what she was. Her memory was a complete blank.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through Memory Blank","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
