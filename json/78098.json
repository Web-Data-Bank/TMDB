Samira is a modern schoolteacher in Sarajevo who takes a job in a small country village just as the war is beginning to ramp up. When Serbian soldiers overrun the village, shoot the men and keep the women as laborers (the older ones) and sex objects (the younger ones), Samira is subjected to the basest form of treatment imaginable.","popularity":2.84,"poster_path":"/dZxaSHjc2CUgCGmQ4psSU2tTHeO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Euroimages Fund of the Council of Europe","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Octagon Films","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i Väst","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":33717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sektor Film Skopje","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":121627,"logo_path":null,"name":"W2 Filmproduktion und Vertriebs","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":8923,"logo_path":null,"name":"WMG Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":5107,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wide Eye Films","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As If I Am Not There","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":12}
