He visits his deserted home and remembers people and events from his adolescence that provide glimpses of pre-Revolutionary society under dictatorship: his uncle, the chief of police; his sister’s involvement with a liberal political association; bathing with the girls from a local brothel; a labor strike that ended in a massacre. Returning to the present he discovers that his father has been assassinated and, in the company of his father’s former servant, joins the revolutionary movement.","popularity":0.857,"poster_path":"/vKvlQdxzmdzEW0NYinyP1sd2j1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5153,"logo_path":"/d4BySWBlcGBBY58FG78DWMi9nrs.png","name":"Estudios Churubusco Azteca","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1973-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El principio","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
