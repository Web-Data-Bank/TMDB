The female narrator tells her personal tale of imprisonment as the wife of the notorious Estonian serial killer, Andreas Hanni. Although her story is bizarre, it touches familiar themes that run throughout modern life: the desire to be loved and the fear of being alone. Pille Hanni's tale unfolds over cinema vérité images of life in several Estonian prisons. At times the images reflect in a literary way the events of the narration, yet they are representations and impressions, rather than traditional documentary style footage of the people involved. This opens the story to a more general interpretation, often with unsettling results. The parallel contents reveal, at two levels of story and social organisation, how the bizarre and inhuman can be tolerable and even addictive in the face of our fears.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tfUEmILIXEQ6YDYLOSCzC2Pyfjr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6168,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eesti Telefilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1993-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Paradisum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
