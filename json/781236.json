We have recorded a visit to the Petite Maison of Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret in moving pictures and an audio track but without explanations. The film is patient, calm and curious: we hear the sound of steps, reverberations from the street nearby, doors and cabinets being opened and closed, and we see the flexible ways in which the house and its furnishings might be used. It is an attempt to illuminate and elucidate the lively “jeu, savant, correct et magnifique des volumes sous la lumière”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Visit to the Petite Maison","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
