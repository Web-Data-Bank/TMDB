As in a vision, the story shifts back forty years and discloses the interior of an orphan asylum. Three babies are there, two boy babies and one baby girl, awaiting adoption into a good home. Years pass and the orphaned children have grown up in three different homes. Miss Leonard's dearest treasures are a pair of tiny baby shoes and a faded plaid shawl given to her foster parents by the asylum nurse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rose of Yesteryear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
