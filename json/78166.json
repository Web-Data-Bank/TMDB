The Hero Gang is a nasty group of thugs terrorizing Hong Kong with their killer robots, Pioneers 1 and 2. While Pioneer 1 looks like an oridinary robot, Pioneer 2 has been modelled on Maria, the gang's #2 thug. When Pioneer 2 gets damaged during a mission to kill an outcast gang member, an inventor on the police force takes her and changes some of her programming. This new code, plus a few injuries to her logic center, start causing Pioneer 2 to develop her own personality.","popularity":4.994,"poster_path":"/qIW8pTUgjeosnvVLwweHf0NonJR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2521,"logo_path":"/e9lXexogBN1nOXA8axzASggea8B.png","name":"Orange Sky Golden Harvest","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1988-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Love Maria","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":12}
