Working in a cloistered rural community, Gabin runs up against the stone walls of fear and prejudice. His theories are proven sound when unwed mother Nicole Courcel gives birth within Gabin's methodology. The childbirth sequence is filmed straight-on with a delicate combination of taste and frankness. Nonetheless, the lurid ad campaign of Cas Du Dr. Laurent sensationalized this sequence all out of proportion.","popularity":2.286,"poster_path":"/2F4MJsPacCWkiMJMdKpJmdtAR0J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cocinex","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cocinor","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10897,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sédif Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1957-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Case of Dr. Laurent","video":false,"vote_average":7.105,"vote_count":19}
