After graduating from film school, the director captured his parents on film over a period of five years. Quiet moments at home, random conversations, festival prayers; all the myriad events that comprise family life were lovingly and unflinchingly recorded. The film chronicles the challenges of having parents living and working in different cities – Delhi and Bombay – just as the filmmaker faces his own challenges, settling into his career as a cinematographer of documentaries and ‘arty’ films, as perceived by his family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s2XZJ8555JG6aCvP4P9fLUGnmSi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snapshots from a Family Album","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
