It's about the word “lesbian”, and the decades of toxic connotations that have made it feel like a hostile piece of language: so much so that today, many queer women hesitate before using it. Rosemary Baker's short film of the poem, which features a cast of real queer women, uses intricate body painting to bring to life what those layers of toxicity feel like. In an era of headline-hitting attacks on lesbians in public, it is a call to arms to take the word back.","popularity":1.004,"poster_path":"/iXk4BgsERaPOSE9bNlyMmqvTLt3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lesbian.","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
