Among them were farmers, businessmen, government officials, intellectuals and ordinary folks who had already experienced the dreadful Year of Terror. Almost one million people from Eastern Europe sought escape from the Soviet regime. The Latvians, who became DPs (displaced persons), tried to create a “little Latvia” within the confines of the refugee camps. This film follows the fates of their children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hBNv1HcUm1GVxFnyOPV8ZiW4p4C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibīrijas bērni","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2015-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God's Lost Sparrows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
