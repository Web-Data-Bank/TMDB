They swore Army oaths, wore uniforms, held rank, and were subject to military justice. By war's end, they had connected over 26 million calls and were recognized by General John J. Pershing for their service. When they returned home, the U.S. government told them they were never soldiers. For 60 years, they fought their own government for recognition. In 1977, with the help of Sen. Barry Goldwater and Congresswoman Lindy Boggs, they won. Unfortunately, only a handful were still alive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uuRdIG4YxAa8wSJL9KNAoqf7Q4i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lincoln Penny Films","origin_country":""},{"id":150438,"logo_path":null,"name":"MJR Visuals","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Incredible Story of America's First Female Soldiers","title":"The Hello Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
