Inspired by British cult classics such as The Wicker Man and Hammer House of Horror, the film explores the fear of isolation and nature versus nature. A special birthday party becomes a living nightmare for City-dwelling couple Sadie and Rick and their friend Johnny. They visit Corinne, an enigmatic local on the island of Amen, which is accessible only by invite and seemingly impossible to get off. A mysterious family connection with Corinne brings horrific consequences as they find themselves trapped by the tide and at the mercy of the island's wild nature.","popularity":0.925,"poster_path":"/1bUUpiqBPJWFhD9YBuwIXMBXbLa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unhappy Birthday","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":8}
