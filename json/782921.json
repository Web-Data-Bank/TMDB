Though made with the original script, location, cast, and post-production procedure, Jankowski’s version replaces all of the actors’ dialogue with crying. Through earpieces, they were able to hear their original lines, so their cries were synchronized with the pace of the original episode.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crying For The March of Humanity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
