It’s not a privilege he was born with; it’s a passion he discovered on his own. Through hard work and dedication, Morrison has become one of the best skiers in the world. The Ordinary Skier traces his journey from the middle class suburbs of Chicago to the Colorado Rockies and into the underground ski-bum subculture that would eventually become Freeskiing. This is the story of how a collection of misfits turned an elite sport upside down, and how an ordinary kid chased his dream and became one of skiing’s most iconic heroes.","popularity":1.093,"poster_path":"/xeSKpR3gxOvOuQZRVb4gdTezgWc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary about Seth Morrison's journey from middle class suburban kid to world famous skier, and his struggle to stay on top of a rapidly evolving sport.","title":"The Ordinary Skier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
