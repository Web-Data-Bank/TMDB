Soon, one of the largest complex of dams ever conceived will be completed on the Narmada. A social struggle is getting organized. We travel on the river until the ocean, on our way to meet inhabitants, beliefs, and convictions that cohabit and are brought into conflict as this valley undergoes major transformations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yosoSKt9LKfOhRgk5m1XbYTI9X1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Narmada","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
