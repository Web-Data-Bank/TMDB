Just sensitively explores the idea that \"the received paradigm of a man's journey is that he always returns to the point of departure expecting to find his home and wife unchanged, unaffected. Benedikte's experience, by contrast, is one of pleasurable displacement - she becomes a nomad in her own mind, never returning to her former status quo.\" Shot on a remote island and on a dilapidated Polish ferry, the trilogy also features an original soundtrack by Theremin composer Dorit Chrysler and American transgender singer/songwriter, Baby Dee.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wZ6yQL8KlagkccIpHwDJ8wkY92h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146908,"logo_path":null,"name":"OUTSET CONTEMPORARY ART FUND","origin_country":""},{"id":146909,"logo_path":null,"name":"THE DANISH ARTS AGENCY","origin_country":""},{"id":146910,"logo_path":null,"name":"VITORIA MIRO GALLERY","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Voyage in Dwelling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
