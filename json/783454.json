Armed with a camera, Yael Abecassis followed her mother and stepped into a world where she had always been a stranger. \"You know, daughter, Morocco is a kind of therapy,\" Raymonde says, and for the first time, they embark on a journey together: from a childhood in the mellah of Casablanca to the dunes of Ashdod and back to Morocco, where the mother became the legendary Raymonde El Bidaoia - a world-famous Moroccan singer. As they journey, Yael discovers a woman who articulates her weaknesses and the complexities of her choices with keen self-awareness, even when mother and daughter are transposed, twined together by guilt, admiration, pain, and above all else - limitless love and music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k6YJUYEbvAEv10gN94xt55SzMrA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2020-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raymonde El Bidaoia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
