Each step in this boot camp, designed by an eccentric and feisty female coach, aims to reveal them to themselves. The task seems to be a tough one, especially as nothing goes as planned between these men.","popularity":4.278,"poster_path":"/9IiTNWohanK62otUDGoCvgx2mI7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77552,"logo_path":"/3aeDaei9tONEGMvWm7W2TKxa1er.png","name":"Curiosa Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":149633,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marvelous Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":9053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ouille Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19037,"logo_path":"/tceh2aAORA5JxIZSLQ1GkzTBZDL.png","name":"uMedia","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":57}
