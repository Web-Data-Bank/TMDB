Rock and Roll Hall of Famer (and early Dirt Band member) Jackson Browne joined in, along with longtime member Jimmy Ibbotson, while a sold-out crowd sings along in the background. From country classics to deep cuts, the tracklist finds bandmates Jeff Hanna (guitars/vocals), Jimmie Fadden (drums/harmonica/vocals), Bob Carpenter (keyboards/accordion/vocals) and John McEuen (banjo/fiddle/guitar/mandolin) swapping harmonies, trading solos, and shining new light on a catalog of vital, vibrant music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yHlTvpNKpeKHG1sBRp8PtZ1FH7s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12700,"logo_path":"/4Bw5eCs1SdRXDmTI84kfuqk6Gqm.png","name":"Warner Music Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Friends - Circlin' Back: Celebrating 50 Years","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
