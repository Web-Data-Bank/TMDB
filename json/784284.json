Over time his pain and anger turns into rage and despair. When psychoanalysis and depression drugs don't work, the young eccentric becomes morbid and introverted, withdrawing from society in a downward spiral to insanity. He not only sets his sights on an aspiring young actress, but on his psychiatrist and the doctor's family too. \"TODD\" takes you on a nail biting, edge of your seat journey into the mind of a budding madman.","popularity":2.111,"poster_path":"/6vopUx5zHGLDilhcoF0tGkGN4pi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Am I The Butterfly","origin_country":""},{"id":147064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dangerous Curves Productions (II)","origin_country":""},{"id":51122,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenway Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Odd man out!","title":"Todd","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
