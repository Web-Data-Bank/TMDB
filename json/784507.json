In 2020, the tradition lives on. Join Clara and her enchanted Nutcracker on a hot air balloon ride to the Land of Snow, and enjoy iconic scenes featuring the Sugar Plum Fairy, Snowflakes, Flowers and more.  As London moved into Tier 4 COVID-19 restrictions with the subsequent cancellation of all scheduled performances of Nutcracker Delights, the Company decided to film and share a recording of this specially-adapted production with its audience as a thank you at the close of its 70th Anniversary year. Nutcracker Delights was filmed on 18 and 19 December at the London Coliseum by Michael Nunn and William Trevitt.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bdw9JSlJoSGEAPgxeO6ofE3U16v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133623,"logo_path":null,"name":"English National Ballet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Specially created for this festive season","title":"Nutcracker Delights: English National Ballet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
