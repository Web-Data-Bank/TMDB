In doing so, they’ve been continually discovering and inventing new meanings of this “home” as a purportedly universal notion. Apartments become studios and museums. Kitchens and sleeping areas become politically loaded terrain, spaces for action, and places to subvert the semiotics of everyday life, mostly through humor. Ahmet Öğüt’s documentary film-essay explores this history with examples from Anri Sala, Nina Yuen, Ulay, Lala Raščić, Harun Farocki, Martha Rosler, Constant Dullaart, Cengiz Tekin, Jonas Lund, Agnieszka Polska, Kuang-Yu Tsui, Nevin Aladağ, Hussein Chalayan, Aernout Mik, Ana Hušman, Ziad Antar, and many others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artworks Made at Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
