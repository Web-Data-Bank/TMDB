Shiteater is a carefully hewn assault on a society bent on consuming itself, an homage to late capitalist ideals of corporate mergers and the dissolution of perimeters – state borders, regulations and individual privacies are redrawn in the light of oligarchy. Psychodramatic in form, Shiteater features a single protagonist, Vancouver’s performance artist Andrew Wilson. Wilson’s transgressive fin-de-siecle performances have typically joined pop culture icons in onanistic rites of excess and immolation, using the body as the intersection of competing and unbearable pressures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7h8BX3UIJfGBBAz3ZXdUWrTsPU8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shiteater","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
