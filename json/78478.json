In order to get out of his financial disaster, he agrees to a deal: he pretends to be the husband of his sister's girlfriend Kim so she can legally adopt a little girl from Thailand. Caesar believes this to be a great idea and is looking forward to his trip to Thailand. After all, he is going to be able to mix business with pleasure--so he thinks. He didn't expect the local police, the Chinese Triads and the director of the orphanage to chip in, who want to make sure that little Mai is going to end up in a nice family.","popularity":6.465,"poster_path":"/seI1WJIUXfmemYmSZzdeyY4lOot.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2951,"logo_path":"/eKuMbpKtI0T8T4LmPsldgNbCaIE.png","name":"Les Films du Kiosque","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":9053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ouille Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2577,"logo_path":"/QZ4zbeJ0sULzGNJvfukrzgx4d8.png","name":"Studio 37","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":23260,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aurel Films","origin_country":""},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":18626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinology","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Don't Choose Your Family","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":168}
