I made the film on the spur of the moment...to go over a band. Red and green leader was very cheap—you got it for a cent a foot or something. Scratching and 'injuring' the flat colour of the leader . . .  I interspliced it with old 16mm footage, breaking up and creating tension between the shots...you know, a native in Papua New Guinea was shooting an arrow, and just as the arrow leaves, the film cuts back into red and green 'travelling' lines (the scratching on the leader). For quite some time this line is running, then the next minute it stops and you see the arrow actually hitting a target. So it gives the impression the arrow is travelling for a long time, on red leader toward the target. The film was shown with different bands, and each time the film looked different.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ogmVNigbznkaHO1XxoRTZawR7jo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red & Green","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
