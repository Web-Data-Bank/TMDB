In a series of mises-en-sc√®ne shot only in natural light, we see a domestic setting overrun by a pack of dogs that roam around restlessly, attacking objects and furniture. The interior of this home is a mental space, violated and lacerated like a body that has undergone violence. Fruit, game, and remnants of food are arranged like still lifes, with allegorical elements evoking the precariousness of life and the loss of innocence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AeNtjc7o8JbU8eOYHUzZDGXYypC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76361,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Between Art Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lacerate","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
