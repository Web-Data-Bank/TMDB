Pascal is tempted by a beautiful salesgirl with whom he finally has a date. But the bombshell promised more than she actually delivers. On the other hand, he is attracted to his precocious niece Sophie. But he only becomes her confidant, living vicariously her first sentimental experiences with boys of her age. On her part, Martine winds up responding to the advances of her office manager who has been trying to pick her up for months. She follows him to his apartment but the alleged Don Juan is nothing but a boor who prefers to watch a soccer match rather than to make love to her. In frustration, she leaves him sprawled before his set while she returns to Pascal. They realize their extramarital experiences have reinforced their couple and can now live happily ever after.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/7IegwYLQ2t4UtjC8DeKnnyc5DxB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All About Women","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
