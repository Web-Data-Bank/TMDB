Once upon a time, many years ago, a neighborhood in Buffalo, NY is mysteriously showered with 20 dollar bills. Theresa, a young girl who everyone thinks is a saint, doesn't have much trouble convincing her loose-knit \"family\" that the money is a gift from Heaven. Years later, Theresa, who has become a nun, has an epiphany that it is time to pay the money back, so she calls the eccentric group together to repay the \"loan.\" The problem is, nobody wants to give back the money, nobody has the money, they don't know to whom it belongs, and most of them can't stand each other. Along the way, the characters learn about family, romance, reconciliation and redemption, and by working together they begin to realize their full potential.","popularity":0.915,"poster_path":"/sOCe6zM9wzLchvNyfjxpYZc5i3d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Five Sisters Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-14","revenue":505675,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What happens when a \"gift from God\" turns out to be a loan?","title":"Manna from Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
