Until he meets and instantly falls in love with fatherless semi-illiterate shop clerk and ditto-daughter Martine Pérez. As his overbearing father Robert feared, stripling hormones run wild at the expense of academic future-building, but paternal authority is overruled by 'young love', which even yields peer-acceptance. Cool big brother Christian, a photographer, tries a more understanding approach, but even that runs into trouble.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'amour en herbe","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
