This epic finale to Bruce McClure’s Wexner Center projection performance builds to an all-consuming crescendo of light and sound. On handwritten program notes that McClure distributed at another performance, he wrote in the margin: \"There is never enough time before an execution.\" And McClure’s performance, especially by ending with the void of Untitled Compliment's maw, felt like an attempt to extend and retain a special type of vision before the petite mort of the house lights. It's an experience that can't be transmitted or recorded by any device other than being in that specific time and place. -Chris Stults, Wexner Center for the Arts","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unnamed Compliment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
