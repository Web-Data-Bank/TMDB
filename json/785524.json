New Wave, Punk and other experimental genres were finding a ready audience and were changing the shape of music forever. Relegated to the southernmost tip of the state, Miami's influential rock artists were one of the nation's best-kept secrets. On January, 28, 2007, The Kids, Z-Cars, Critical Mass, Charlie Pickett, The Cichlids, Slyder, Tight Squeeze and special guests The Romantics took the stage at Club Cinema in Pompano Beach, Florida to the delight of nearly 3,000 fans that came from around the world to see their favorite bands play together one more time. The event culminated in South Florida's biggest reunion concert. This extraordinary untold story has been brought to the forefront and examines the compelling and often personal journey of eight original Miami bands and their quest to leave an indelible mark on the music they loved.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6CLutpT0DH38meskJA3TwgozCI3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock and a Hard Place: Another Night at the Agora","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
