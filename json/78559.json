He lives in a small apartment in Paris with his wife Michelle and, in spite of their ostensible success, the couple are having trouble making ends meet. One day they receive the utterly unexpected news that they are the sole inheritors of a wealthy neighbor, M. Guillemet, whom they have never met. Guillemet has left them his old townhouse along with all of his belongings, but with two conditions -- the first is that the dead man's papers be left untouched, and the second is that his live-in maid Clemence Richbourg remain employed at the estate. The Dorsets soon learn why they were the recipients of such strange generosity. Guillemet had set up a camera with a massive zoom lens pointing to their bedroom window. The couple is shocked and disgusted, but not enough to give up their new tony digs.","popularity":0.981,"poster_path":"/ppOiQEJ6j3mqG1FGCTpiftCzw3U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171211,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carrere Group D.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":171212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cin√©mane Films","origin_country":""},{"id":1115,"logo_path":"/ntH7T5gsN6wtyrfHGHJDTuneQ7o.png","name":"M6 Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Across the Road","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":9}
