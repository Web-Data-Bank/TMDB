Light and darkness, beauty and danger come together in this passionate tale of love against the odds.  At once evocative and unsettling, this production collides two contrasting worlds in Rae Smith’s elegant designs made of “brilliant stage-pictures”. Rusalka’s forest home is a dappled space of sunshine and shadows, full of strange woodland creatures, while the Prince’s court is a world of sleek modernity and sophistication – a world of man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Ap4xg2T79gMTjyc3WI6Bqu51Adh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dvořák:  Rusalka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
