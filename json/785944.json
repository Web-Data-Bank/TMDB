Yet, due to the taboo and stigmatisation of mental illness, it is still under prioritized and as a result the welfare system is pushed to its limits. The care of the mentally ill instead falls upon relatives, most often parents and they become the lifeline and primary carer. When a family member gets sick it affects everyone in that family and especially those who love them. LOVE BOUND unconvers the unconditional love, which governs the relationship most parents have to their children and that must somehow be altered, when a child is suffering from mental illness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o6GMDOivXTaEkL5PuNYa3EpsxxX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13209,"logo_path":"/oRnIhQrSz04N1TvffuiDZz3n4Rd.png","name":"Bullitt Film","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":758,"logo_path":"/fft3jrctrZNcgAxgN1w5Givtzip.png","name":"TV 2","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Bound - When Your Child Becomes Mentally Ill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
