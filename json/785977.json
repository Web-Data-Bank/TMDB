The picture it paints is one which could apply to other parts of Vienna and other European cities, an insight into daily reality revealing how little people know about each other and how thoughtlessly they expect strangers to behave according to their values.\r We hear the views of Austrians and immigrants, Yugoslavians and Turks who have lived here for twenty years. Their conversations reveal hatred of foreigners and children and prejudices not limited to a social class at all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prisma Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nix Multikulti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
