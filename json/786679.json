A shape-shifting parable of politics and religion in a post-9/11 world, Chanâ€™s animation is both morally and aesthetically resonant. Drawn on a computer and projected on the gallery floor, the simple but dramatic silhouettes in the work describe an apocalyptic vision of the world. Shadowy bodies fall, earthly objects rise to the heavens, and the audience is confronted with the meaning of salvation and faith in an era dominated by war, consumerism, and terror.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1st Light","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
