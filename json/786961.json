However, after suffering a minor stroke he discovered that he could no longer keep the beat and with that painful realisation, his professional career was over. In filmmaker Leo Pfeiferâ€™s documentary short Lost Time, Wager reflects on a life of music which was lost and whether the term drummer still applies to him.
