The Loop and Slides were first created for a live performance at Pix Film Gallery in Toronto. The film loop is accompanied by slides of colours, fragments of images, words that act as inter-titles, creating echoes between the film's continuous vertical movement and the stillness of the fixed slide.  The found sound is a poem written by Italian beat poet Massimo Mori in 1980, from a collection of poetry created between Italy and Quebec, Canada.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5L1Lws22QW35PxVlNNSKQ1uioFh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colonna Continua","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
