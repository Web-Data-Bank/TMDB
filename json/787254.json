The deacon wants to buy a horse from Harry's father, but because Mr. Price will not give it to him at his own figure the deacon quarrels with Price, and forbids his daughter to see Harry. A troupe of minstrels, stranded, are walking back to New York, and Harry and Betty meet them. They make up as actors, and, accompanied by their new-found friends, rush to the deacon's home and tell him they are an eloping couple who wish to be married. The deacon ties the knot, and after the ceremony the make-up is removed, and he finds he has officiated at his own daughter's wedding. He finally sees the humor of the situation, and his charitable spirit is shared by Harry's father, who makes him a present of the horse he coveted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deacon Outwitted","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
