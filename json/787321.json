Sewell, a former Baltimore city homicide investigator and narcotics officer had grown tired of the aggressive tactics used by the Baltimore Police Department...particularly those targeting black communities. Determined to deploy a different approach to law enforcement, Sewell implemented an intensive community policing plan. He and his officers parked their cars and walked the streets. Sewell's system worked: crime plummeted. Residents both black and white became ardent supporters of Sewell's new paradigm of policing. But a conflict was brewing; an ongoing dispute over racial discrimination engulfed Sewell and his officers in a battle that would not only cost them their jobs and professional reputations, but would thrust them into an emotional legal battle that would touch all segments of the community.","popularity":0.611,"poster_path":"/9qEiHCbEEUOa29cfUqfz5Yss4XL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Friendliest Town","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
