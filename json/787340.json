Originally titled Taranga by the original director Alexander Markey, but was completed by Collins and released as Under the Southern Cross in 1929, then with the introduction of sound was given a soundtrack and retitled The Devilâ€™s Pit in 1930. The film was shot on White Island, which has an active volcano.  It is one of four films (with Down on the Farm, Hei Tiki and On the Friendly Road) which lay claim to be the first \"New Zealand talkie\", although dubious as the sound was added to the 1930 release in the United States.  Only fragments of out-takes are left. The film probably has no connection with the 1927 British film of the same name, directed by Gustav Pauli.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Neither tribal custom, danger nor the sacred ban of 'tapu' could overcome the strength of his love.","title":"Under The Southern Cross","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
