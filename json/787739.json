The series is called POEMFIELD. All of these films explore variations of poems, computer graphics, and in some cases combine live action images and animation collage; all are geometric and fast moving and in color. There are eight films in the computer animated art series. As samples of the art of the future all the films explore variations of abstract geometric forms and words. In effect these works could be compared to the illuminated manuscripts of an earlier age. Now typography and design are created at speeds of 100,000 decisions per second, set in motion a step away from \"mental movies.\" POEMFIELD No. 2 and 5 are all colorized by Brown and Olvey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poem Field No. 5: Free Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
