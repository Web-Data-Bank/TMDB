The 70's evolve into a tweaky sound track by Knox Bronson, electronic culture mastermind, with scenes from McKay's world travels in a highly abstracted form. The 80's movement travels into pure geometric and color abstractions, with an uplifting electronic/acoustic soundtrack by Dean Evenson. McKayâ€™s 90's movement goes deep into fantastic liquid color landscapes with a dark, electronic music voyage crafted in collaboration with McKay by Greg Jalbert.  This video captures McKay's main installation piece at a retrospective of four decades of his work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, February-May 1999.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/blzQOi778gFW9uUbycFwMzBm43x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Altered States (1966-1999)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
