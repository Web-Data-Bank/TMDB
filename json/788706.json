Chonda goes to Hollywood and nothing gets past her!

For the first time ever, Chonda answers questions from the audience, allowing Chonda to do what she does best - saying out loud whatever pops into the party she calls her mind.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/sKpAjgaFIx0iAb7HM4gE4STiMiD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chonda Pierce: Did I Say That Out Loud?","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
