He dozes off at his job as a security guard. Alone since the death of his wife, the father’s daily life is filmed by his daughter. While turning her gaze on ordinary things like garbage, keys, puppies, flies and lizards, we can almost sense the strong smells of summer and the sound of thunder at night. Suddenly, the father turns and waves to us. The father-daughter bond is expressed here in very few words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cK4R9HA5PXpAcgoPmOcZSli9Ksw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147810,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Boxer Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hard Good Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
