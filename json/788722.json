It was a few of our friends, in the last days of summer, trying to figure out how to remember. Sometimes we made them in secret. Sometimes we spent days on them. But a plaque could be a hastily-done afterthought, and it would still become a symbol to future generations of what friendship could really be, what it could mean in our lives. Some of us made several plaques - some of us never put our name on any. But anyone who's spent time in the Tzofim Bet Am knows that a unique, mysterious history lives on its walls, and what a summer once felt like, way back then. Because everyone loves a good story.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/oxlj9KIkVl2P3bPnPNuYjpCOcv9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It was a few of our friends, in the last days of summer, trying to figure out how to remember.","title":"I Was Here: Eisner's Story from the Inside Out","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
