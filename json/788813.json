In his 7,000-mile adventure, Sayle discovers mounties, moose, and a colorful assortment of railroad men and women. He also shares glimpses of a lesser-known Canada - Fishermen of the Maritime provinces, Indian settlements on the edge of the Arctic Ocean, polar bears frolicking, cowboys in the prairies - all loosely linked by the now resurgent transcontinental railway. Take the LAST TRAIN ACROSS CANADA for an unforgettable rail adventure, one filled with romance and extraordinary beauty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Train Across Canada","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
