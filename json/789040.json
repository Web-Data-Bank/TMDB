The title of the work refers to the Americanization of local customs: Black Friday, a day of unbridled shopping, is now widespread around the world. The final scene depicts the two women exhausted, stretched out on the sumptuous marble floor, representing the despair of mass consumerism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/441fYxw9S1cN0R0k7D9qHjgdV1f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Friday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
