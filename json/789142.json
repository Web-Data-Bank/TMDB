Their wives persuade them to go to a spiritualist meeting and the medium makes the startling announcement that a man present is not true to his wife. The women demand the name of the man, and she refuses to answer questions in the meeting but promises to do so at a private séance next morning. At the appointed hour the wives arrive, and Brown and his friends try to hush up the medium, but she makes them pay dearly for her statement to their wives that their husbands are true to them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brown’s Séance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
