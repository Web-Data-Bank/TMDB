The famine precipitated by the Great Leap Forward, which killed perhaps 30 million people by the early 1960s, had horrified her, and as political turmoil began again only a few years later, she publicly called on China’s leader, Mao Zedong, to take responsibility for his mistakes and resign. Ms. Wang was sent to a psychiatric hospital and drugged. Released and paraded around the capital, she refused to recant. Instead, she repeated her accusations. Her jaw was broken to stop her from talking. After a mass trial at the Workers’ Stadium on Jan. 27, 1970, she was executed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vdanyOwZSslDApM19Fm8s03PBRG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Mother Wang Pei Ying","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
