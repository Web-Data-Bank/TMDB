From 1942 to 1946 Giuseppe was a prisoner in several different camps: Tambow, Oranki and Suzdal. He got to know many people, heard lot of stories and came across a truly unique piece of reportage. The narrator and second character of the story is the actress Karina Arutyunyan who acts the part of a Russian woman that lives in Italy for years, whose grandfather fought on the Russian side during Second World War. The two characters in this story are emotionally very close; however, they are diametrically opposed. While Giuseppe and his story are both real, Katerina is a fictional character; that is how fiction and reality are closely intertwined along the story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dvrn1OYbCLME4dJFHAodm62k9f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emera Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bassil'ora","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
