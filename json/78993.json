When her husband is laid off and she wonders for how long, her office pal Jackie recommends Alban, a psychic (and compulsive gambler), who promptly tells Chantel of a curse on her that will take three sessions (and 10,000 FF) to dispel. Through happenstance, she meets Alban's half-brother; thinking she is following the psychic predictions, she tries to start an affair with him. She also undergoes Alban's exorcism, and soon, terrible things indeed start to happen. Is there any way out of her misery?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oh89CrdgAP9cakOBTCYEHfm6Vvs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Square Productions International (SPI)","origin_country":""},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":5281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cofimage 12","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fortune Tellers and Misfortune","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":5}
