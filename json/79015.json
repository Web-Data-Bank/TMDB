But that was before Dr. Parpalaid retired and was replaced by a charlatan by the name of Knock. A real genius this one, for he soon managed to persuade everyone that they were ill. And not only didn't they resent him but they even loved their physician, who made a fortune and brought prosperity to the village by turning it into a big hospital.","popularity":3.852,"poster_path":"/tWDYV3ixNiAr3wkNIlLDvDgvjGm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Jacques Roitfeld","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1951-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dr. Knock","video":false,"vote_average":7.384,"vote_count":43}
