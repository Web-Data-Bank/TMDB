It's Saturday night, Naty wants to go out to celebrate her birthday, but her mother won't let her because Naty has to work early. Diego is looking for a way to get out of work tomorrow to show up to his son's soccer game. Ruth is very happy because starting tomorrow she is going to start earning minimum wage, the result of many years of work. It is 10 am on August 1 and Lili is not sure if she is going to the supermarket or the pantry to get what would be used for the family Sunday lunch. No one knows each other but somehow fate will manage to link them and they will cross paths in Acruzado, where justice does not serve the poor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/foDQrv4tcKADdyNcCK7fgSYHxla.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PY","name":"Paraguay"}],"release_date":"2013-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crossed","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6}
