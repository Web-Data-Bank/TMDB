Now he is out seeking revenge against his old \"buddy\" who lied on the stand and put him in jail. He brings along his young granddaughter and drives like a maniac as he nears his destination. That sets three brutish thugs on his tail, anxious to corner him and end his days behind the wheel. So while Guillaume is chasing down his betrayer, he is being chased in turn. It's not a formula for continued good health.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/syoBvupEMEFrDVaGQKsK5cPUeil.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Equinoxe","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
