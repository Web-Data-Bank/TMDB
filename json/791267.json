Set in a dingy Lower East Side apartment in the 1980s, Beirut follows the story of Torch, a young man who is in quarantine after testing positive to a nameless disease. His girlfriend, refuses to leave him isolating alone. It’s raunchy, it’s real, it’s poetic; and it reminds us of the power of stories, and their role in fostering hope, solidarity and documentation of extraordinary times.","popularity":0.916,"poster_path":"/aV5Iw4sXAMDXMVpF21lOd9o5xgg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145567,"logo_path":null,"name":"MCC Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beirut: An MCC Virtual TV Event","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
