Everyone’s favourite grumbling funny man and star of BBC2’s Mock The Week, Andy Parsons is back on the road in 2011 with his brand new show, Gruntled. Britain's foremost topical comedian returns to the stage and DVD for more logically rigorous, cutting edge comedy. Expect the usual clever politically inspired bemusements and disappointedly crushed enthusiasm. This is a sharp, thought provoking show by one of our most astute comedians in the UK.","popularity":0.932,"poster_path":"/jnJpRzmwc6I35VSVBizWN5n70hw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andy Parsons: Gruntled","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
