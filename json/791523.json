You’re not supposed to go there. You’re not even supposed to know it exists. But Prue McKeel is about to enter this enchanted wonderland. Her baby brother Mac has been taken by a murder of crows into the forest’s depths, and she – along with her hapless classmate, Curtis – is going to get him back. Prue might think she’s too old for fairytales, but she’s just found herself at the center of one. One filled with strange talking animals, roguish bandits, and powerful figures with the darkest intentions.","popularity":1.469,"poster_path":"/dW65yBrb2oszg3vKHYlHuKO4iNq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11537,"logo_path":"/AgCkAk8EpUG9fTmK6mWcaJA2Zwh.png","name":"Laika Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Wildwood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
