As today’s fan seems far less passionate about WWE offerings, perhaps what they need is a jumpstart with some of yesteryear’s themes. A product with “attitude.”  This edition of Guest Booker features former OVW booker and current TNA creative member, Al Snow. Snow was right in the mix during the edgy attitude era, reminding audiences what “everybody wanted.”  So how would he define the “attitude era” and just what separates that from today’s product?
