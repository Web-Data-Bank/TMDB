But a few years away lies a darker, more violent, bloody style of wrestling that would jumpstart the business. And what if Vince could see that? What if he were to predate ECW, and launch the hardcore style across the U.S.? Who would he hire to book it?  Well, there was a booker working for him in a wrestling capacity at the time. This booker had traveled the world, and violence was his middle name.
