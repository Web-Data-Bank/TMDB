Beginning with the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Sumar traces the relationship of Islam to the state in an effort to understand how women are coping with and surviving the increasing religiosity of civil and political life in her country. Raised in a more secular time, she struggles to comprehend how religious schools have expanded at once unthinkable rates and presents chilling footage of a mother encouraging her toddler to be a martyr when he grows up. Mixing political analysis with interviews with activist colleagues, noted Islamic scholars and Pakistani women who have chosen to embrace fundamentalism, Sumarâ€™s provocative questions dramatically capture the tension between liberal and fundamentalist forces that are shaping life in contemporary Pakistan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/712AMlP1a1783J6jG6oPSABfsqD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For a Place Under the Heavens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
