In order to disrupt the viewer, American filmmaker Roger Horn juxtaposes these found images with audio he recorded while attending a wildlife film-training program in Cape Town in 2007. Through the disruption of filmmaking conventions Horn looks to make the viewer confront their own stereotypes and ponder the nature of capturing images in Southern Africa.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3mwYk2MCD5yowOU4cNIiowO2wdF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"African Film School","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
