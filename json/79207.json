Paul Provenza spends the whole show trapped in a system of giant tubes. Skits include a new director and an auditioning starlet who can and will do anything, and the Three Stooges on a construction project. Other notable tricks include earthworms finding a photo from a stack, a borrowed ring apparently cut from a volunteer's stomach, and a bullet swap.","popularity":1.019,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buggs and Rudy Discount Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":8144,"logo_path":null,"name":"Channel X","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phobophilia: The Love of Fear","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
