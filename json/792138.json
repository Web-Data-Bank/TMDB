Film reels and photos of the time show Imants Ziedonis and the DAGi participants – Māra Zālīte, Anna Žīgure, Roze Stiebra, Andris Buiķis, Vitolds Kucins and others. Today, with their contemporary experiences, they reflect on a time when the dream of an independent Latvia seemed impossibly far away. We’re Still Here reminds the younger generations that it’s possible to do good in the name your nation and its future not matter the circumstances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zPi7DQbe3szqL42S7QWlbRQyHo2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studija 2","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2013-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We’re Still Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
