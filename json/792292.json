They are terrible and become an overnight success. The worldly European, Heide, becomes a cocaine addict, but plays her cards right, keeps her mouth shut, and becomes the new (solo) Diva of the Cabana Room with an avant-garde swastika and combat-gear skinhead act. Robin does talk shows (and gets sued), has a lesbian affair with her manager, the fascistic Ms. Susan (and gets burned), and finally does a nude photo session (and gets fired).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yVCA52QQdpSQetsCm7ie9cOtm3M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
