In the middle of it all is regular guy Keith Gill (Paul Dano), who sinks his life savings into a single stock: GameStop, the mall videogame retailer, which he’s convinced is undervalued. If he’s wrong, he’ll lose everything. But if he’s right, and if he can convince other ordinary Joes to join the movement, then they’ll rocket GameStop to the moon – leaving billionaires holding the bag.","popularity":5.733,"poster_path":"/1ylPQlDsT9A0tjMYNor33e4Vt6O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22146,"logo_path":"/jPBtpMh0AUFqf9yfOJXer9d5Rei.png","name":"Black Bear Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":172841,"logo_path":"/MKTZVUIIWMjwpF58tGtAx8UXFs.png","name":"Ryder Picture Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":11341,"logo_path":"/xytTBODEy3p20ksHL4Ftxr483Iv.png","name":"Stage 6 Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Dumb Money","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
