Whatever it is. Should he marry his girlfriend, should he start a business with his friend, what color should he buy shoes for? Life for him is an eternal dilemma.  But one day, fate made a choice for him. Vansan crashes into an advertising post by car and makes a leap in time for 16 years in advance.  Now at about forty, he heads a large corporation, is married to a woman with whom he is barely familiar, has a teenage son who is constantly bold to him, and an early-ripened daughter.
