And those verses seem to guide Karin Idelson's camera in this exploration of, to call them somehow, the \"popular applications\" of romantic songs. Cumbia, soft-rock, reggaeton, pop, boleros, hits from the '80s and from before too: music is in the air of the city, and a love song traps it in places where it is so naturalized that we hardly pay it attention but also, and especially, in the most hidden or unusual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oFyhVAYcCAE4EfoaVX6panz9Vyj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canción de amor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
