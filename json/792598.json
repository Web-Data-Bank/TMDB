The film explores gender transition, the permanent medical side-effects of hormones and surgeries, the propaganda by 'woke' corporations that glorifies thousands of stereotypical gender presentations coalesced as fashion, a surge in pronoun policing, language hijacking that calls women ‘menstruators’, and the many hurdles women face while trying to question this modern-day misogyny. The film amplifies the voices of detransitioners, clinicians, psychiatrists, sociologists, feminists, academics and concerned citizens.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/bPOkeX7dvHkyQQQ2Ddf3LRSqvIL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148494,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lime Soda Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2021-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dysphoric: Fleeing Womanhood Like a House on Fire","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":2}
