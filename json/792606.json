Carlos Lerner, born in Tucumán and raised in Monigotes, Santa Fé province, made a place for himself in the elite French turf with determination and work. When a Spanish owner entrusts him with Volvoreta to run in France, Carlos still does not know that the filly is an unusual competitor. He makes his debut winning, and after three races he is still undefeated. This opens the door for him to run the Prix de Diane, a prestigious Group 1 that would allow Carlos, in the event of victory, to establish himself as a first-line coach. The film closely follows the filly's training during the two weeks leading up to the big race and the stress of those tending to her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nQ7676yI9QnSCIA60d4VFrfWi9f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2003-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volvoreta","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
