Rizzoli. A mundane architectural draftsman by day, the architectural transcriber of the divine by night, Rizzoli created elaborate Beaux-Arts influenced monuments which would never be built. Accompanied by his witty and poignant commentary, the drawings served as translations for the voices and the hallucinations that haunted him. By deftly weaving Rizzoli's words, archival footage, photos and evocative present day scenes of San Francisco's historic architecture, the film tells the story of Rizzoli's life and his work -- an exaltation of architecture as pleasure, as memorial, as redemption.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4SAAkIB0gDZM2QNxLmhRuNsk8KT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149369,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hearts \u0026 Hands Media Arts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yield to Total Elation: The Life and Art of Achilles Rizzoli","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
