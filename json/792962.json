After a long year of waiting, the news arrive: an assisted living residence is found for her. Eva takes the first steps towards the \"normal\" life she longs for: to find a job, earn an income of her own, visit her mother... even find love. While she’s taking stock of her past and works on her self-confidence as well as her trust in the outside world, she also fixes firmly on her main goal: to reconnect with the son she lost custody of 20 years ago and ask him to forgive her. The First Woman is a film about second chances, the search for \"normality\" and the borderline between lucidity and darkness.","popularity":0.663,"poster_path":"/jEO0Gh9ifENBS2OjktbVRfYCgEb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mosaic","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eva has two dreams: leaving the psychiatric hospital in search of a “normal” life and to reunite with her son after 15 years.","title":"The First Woman","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
