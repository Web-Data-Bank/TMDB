On it, like in life, people experience friendship and love, and sometimes feel lonely. On board, the announcement over the PA system outlines the rules, and then a reminder that the train wonâ€™t be stopping. Do we hurtle through life without making any stops? What are we thinking? We all know that the moment will come when our train pulls to a stop, but not how and when, and what happens afterwards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dK9jUXrcSoTjtZT0sZzsYIUgQLj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34804,"logo_path":"/sdu4YsenhKo5Jax4XHU0dxNQTXT.png","name":"Locomotive Productions","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Train Stops at 20:14","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
