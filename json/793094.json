Little fireflies are flying in the sky, playing happily with little goldfishes in the water. After playing, the firefly bid farewell to her friends, and flew around to inform other little insects that they must attend the firefly gala tonight on time. At this moment, a dark cloud floated over, and the firefly, who was eager to make an announcement, encountered heavy rain, and was exhausted and injured, and even the fireflies on his body were extinguished. The sad firefly never forgets the unfinished task of sending notifications. In order to help him complete the task, the little goldfish decides to help him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2VCRPJtyvOfPTFZoc5EjX12oudx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6223,"logo_path":"/lOxuAoSiKVeePamkUq5VCyUFiPw.png","name":"Shanghai Animation Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1958-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beautiful Little Goldfish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
