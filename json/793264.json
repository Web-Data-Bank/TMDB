The Falconer weaves his present-day mission with the story of his past, both of which are deeply rooted in issues of social and environmental injustice. Stotts’s worldview in a nutshell: nature heals. In a forgotten corner of our nation’s capital, he takes the time to break through to those too often dismissed as “hard to reach.” This is a story of second chances: for injured birds of prey, for an abandoned plot of land, for a group of teenagers who have dropped out of high school, and for the falconer himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cWKCiqNlokI9pafCjrJbhJ0m0Aj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155235,"logo_path":null,"name":"3paw Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Falconer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
