It is a frightening piece of work in that it asks us to assume responsibility for ourselves, our actions. How, after listening to Dr. Thomas Szasz, can we blame someone else anymore? Equally frightening is the realization that mental illness could touch our lives, not just someone else's. Without attempting to give an answer, \"Full Moon Darkness\" raises many valid questions - questions we should ask ourselves at least once.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qtInQWtTlNbx8VKv3tcYuZMjT0O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Moon Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
