Thousands of sightings by highly credible witnesses worldwide cannot be denied. The big question is not whether the Aliens are here among us, monitoring us, perhaps preparing us for some kind of end game that will change humanity forever, but why is the government and military still denying the fact that we are not alone? While many of the sightings every year are debunked, it's the ones that defy description, obliterate our notions of physics and science and exhibit other worldly capabilities beyond our grasp. The mind blowingly bizarre and most mysterious Alien Encounters of all, these are the cases we call Alien Chronicles.","popularity":2.294,"poster_path":"/hc3SUfscIhExfD75dQ15iFOM6IM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alien Chronicles Top Ufo Encounters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
