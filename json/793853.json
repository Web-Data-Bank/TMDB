Shot during a weekend trip from Victoria BC to Dallas TX for a single DIY concert, it interviews members of Deterioration, Cognizant, and Imperial Slaughter. Live concert footage combines with interviews and Super 8mm film to create an impression of the people who play grindcore, why they love the genre, and their experiences as practitioners of the niche style.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yvJ93rft7sLTSvaR5fCF5mEXwA9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitkino","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grindcore Vacation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
