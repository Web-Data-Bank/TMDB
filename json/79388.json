But after the violent death of his father, the boy experiences life’s harsher side: his mother remarries and his stepfather demands obedience without seeking to deserve Adam’s respect. Gradually everything the boy was attached to starts to fall apart around him, and if his dead father hadn’t visited him he wouldn’t even know which path to take. The inexperience of youth, loneliness, and impulsiveness prevent him from using reason and cool consideration to face the obstacles in his way, and he even sometimes provokes those who stand by him. And thus he finds himself in a situation for which there is only one solution.","popularity":0.632,"poster_path":"/7ReuhQ5HzkMvIfsTYEgsb9s9EYV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64295,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Film Praha","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":55591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Titanic","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2011-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gypsy","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":7}
