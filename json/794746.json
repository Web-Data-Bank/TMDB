But her guardian harbours his own plans for her. When jack-of-all-trades Figaro rushes to the young couple's aid, bribery, deceit and comic entanglements ensue. Will he succeed in saving the day - and love?  Bursting with exuberant music, captivating comedy and ingenious disguises, Rossini’s masterpiece is the ultimate feel-good opera. In Den Norske Opera and Ballett’s new production, director Jetske Mijnssen takes the story seriously - didn’t Count Almaviva and Rosina’s union turn out unhappy in Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro? - and shows how comedy is always close to tragedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iss4IHEFof7MlC9ggrV2wm8cMXl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Barber of Seville","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
