It took place on June 12, 2005 at the The Supper Club in New York, New York. The shows name is due to the fact that it took place the same weekend as the Extreme Championship Wrestling reunion shows Hardcore Homecoming (promoted by Shane Douglas and Jeremy Borash, taking place on June 10 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and ECW One Night Stand (promoted by World Wrestling Entertainment, taking place later that evening in New York, New York).  In order to help promote the event, local WB station WPIX 11 filmed a news story on ROH. Clips of the report were shown throughout the DVD release.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zuoHpGB4ef0T1EWCll8hxRHFGRU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103501,"logo_path":"/bDAPxOGj1dZWTtv5ubJPh97PiNF.png","name":"Ring of Honor (ROH)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ROH: The Future Is Now","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
