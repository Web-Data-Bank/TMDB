So we returned to the place where we recorded A Black Mile To The Surface and played the album in its entirety. We are so excited to share this film, for free, to everybody. This album and your reception to it has exceeded our expectations, and we felt this the best way to thank you all for supporting our music. This feels like the perfect way to close the Black Mile chapter, and I’m excited to say that this is more than just a concert. It’s also the beginning. So tune in February 12th at 8PM est. Love you.","popularity":1.756,"poster_path":"/syvlFKNB7GUl9NEz0kDYRsC2Hfo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148960,"logo_path":"/ewkmhFDKwSmcLma4jCGEV1KjMGV.png","name":"Super Canoe","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Full Album Live Concert Event","title":"Manchester Orchestra: A Black Mile to the Surface","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
