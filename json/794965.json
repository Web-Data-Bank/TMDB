This is far better than a Zoom show with me sitting at my desk: it looks and sounds beautiful. It’s what you really want to see (as opposed to being the only thing we can bring you) and it’s the absolute closest thing to being at one of my shows. And - as luck would have it - I’m playing all your favorite songs. How do I know? Because we asked you to choose the setlist way back then, and you did.","popularity":0.649,"poster_path":"/5fUXe1lQ0vj7cbnmfRjg3AVlo5l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wesley Stace/TOWNSONGS 2021","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Wesley Harding: Don't Look Back Now - The Film","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
