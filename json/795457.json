The topic of this abstractedly crafted animation applies to anything that struggles to be free. It can be a phenomenon occurring deep within the mind, or an individual confronting the standardized masses.

The solution and conclusion of the story is open for interpretation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nlx8eou0zAwAOrlcbJupnrovjSK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116296,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCLA Animation Workshop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Symphony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
