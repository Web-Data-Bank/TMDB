However, Hanane, who wanted to continue her current job, put it off. At the bar near Hanane's mansion, there were several customers and Kishida, a childhood friend of the store's master Fujieda. Although they are over fifty each other, Kishida is a little envious of Fujieda, who emails a woman even though she is open. Fujieda enjoyed an affair with a married woman in her forties, Eriko.  One day, as Hanane walks while making a phone call for work, she meets Kyosuke, a former boyfriend, and heads for Fujieda's bar.
