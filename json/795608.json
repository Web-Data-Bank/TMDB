Enduring the scorn of random people, the elements, and coping with a terrible head injury, he finds hope in the unlikeliest of friends: a dog and a pastor (Greg Mason, \"Midnight (2020),\" \"Dispatched\"). Together, they explore kindness, compassion, and what it means to live--and to become a Godsend to others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bdTil9Rtj3RadfPvIxwAU2G59f3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Godsend","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
