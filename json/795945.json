Whose sign can only be evoked, divined by a soothsayer in fact. Finally, if the sibyl does not want anything but 'death'; and if her 'voice' remains as phoné; this invoked 'space' - this azimuth - is therefore a visual and sound horizon - aneuphoné. Twisting in flute music and enveloped by the iridescence of the sunset.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kArA2EVx0Y0oyieGzekOVGotUGy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sibilla","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
