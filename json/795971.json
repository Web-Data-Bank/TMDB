If you walk into the cave, it looks like a screen, a rectangle showing clouds and white light, just like a film. Director Kim Minjung delves into the bloody history of Jeju, where tens of thousands were killed in a massacre in 1948. The camera follows the traces in the landscape, sometimes transformed by a strident, distance-creating red light, accompanied by a commentary by avant-garde filmmaker Hollis Frampton. Film as a means to address history and its taboos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lbQ2PFgOyprjexlaRe3wksaaRaU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Filter is Withdrawn.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
