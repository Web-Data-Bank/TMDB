Desperate to regain her sense of self, she jumps at the chance to work with her long-time collaborator, director Roger Woo, again. Only this time, he casts her as the lead in a do-your-own stunts martial arts film.  The role requires extensive training and though Moon is at first uncertain, she leaves her young son in the care of Roger’s assistant and commits herself to back-breaking training. As soon as she starts to gain some confidence, Roger breaks the news to her: the only way the film can move ahead is to cast her ex-husband, Julliard, as the male lead.","popularity":0.616,"poster_path":"/AnjaFZIFNnb8QJuJLqeSc86WbEc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Da Huang Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":63617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hong Kong International Film Festival Society","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":45116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenlight Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":57612,"logo_path":"/dg4sSBjn9pv5mswjUxItrPLZf6X.png","name":"Epicmedia","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barbarian Invasion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
