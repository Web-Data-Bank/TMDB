This precious exploration of almost 150 years of history and work was filmed in the mountainous southern region of Serra Gaúcha in Brazil, where a population largely originating from Trentino and Veneto introduced viticulture and still speaks the talian dialect, and in the areas of northern Italy where the families came from. The film returns there in search of the memories and traditions handed down to their descendants.","popularity":0.74,"poster_path":"/bzjiMkeepNwzCQ9JnirIlQSpb6q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70464,"logo_path":"/okmGylyf0L8N3K2svgA21WqBoRB.png","name":"Camisa Listrada","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Legado Italiano","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3}
