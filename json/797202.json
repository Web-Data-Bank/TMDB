Anu Raud","overview":"Textile artist Anu Raud enjoys life on her grandfather's farm in K채채riku. She has never thought about demolishing something there just because it's old. Or to change something just for the act of changing something. She likes to be surrounded by life. Anu also likes small things - they just fit the country life. She longs to see small roads and small villages. She believes that in small places, people can grow much larger than in large places. And in large places, she thinks people just stay small.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rfux23r2tbwyFxuOxZXawmZQ448.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149347,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umberto Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2021-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"P채rand.
