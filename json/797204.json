Black ASL today conveys an identity and sense of belonging that mirrors spoken language varieties of the African American hearing community. The program highlights the different uses of space, hand use, directional movement, and facial expression, which are ways that Black ASL distinguishes itself as a vibrant dialect of American Sign Language. The African American Deaf community is now embracing their unique variety as a symbol of solidarity and a vital part of their identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nicbRNVcSYi5ZI94pE5kt9wrNQH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of Black ASL","title":"Signing Black in America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
