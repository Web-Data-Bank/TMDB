Tossing more species to the margins increasingly faster, extinction highlights the extraordinary level of disturbance and precarity that the bonding of science and capitalism has imposed on our and other species. Most creatures and places of the earth have been measured, consumed, exhausted, infected, eliminated, and otherwise killed. Becoming adds an affective dimension to our relation with the environment and helps to grasp the disappearance of species, not only as destructive and final, but as transitory. Becoming-with-the-dead mobilizes our imagination for a future life without reconciliation or a place to hide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mN6EeDwHO4TA9XHf7n4ODIphMlX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Becoming Extinct (Wild Grass)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
