These people, whose names allude to familiar characters from Jose Rizal's novels, narrate their private yet vivid stories of loss, longing, and Third World despair, all intersecting in a public arena that is their packed community. Theirs are lives seen with an oftentimes comic eye, unabashedly bound by a wild and brimming sense of Filipino hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cQkKw57kBfEt2dhHuXd6RDgEoGK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmless Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THIS IS NOT A FILM BY KHAVN","title":"Philippine Bliss","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
