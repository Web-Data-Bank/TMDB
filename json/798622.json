In this film, young subversive gentlemen comment on the coexistence in male prisons in Pernambuco during the military period. From the arrival to the prison, from the affection, from the hunger strike, from the role of collectives within the jail. The feeling of belonging is what moves this documentary. To the characters, belonging to a generation.
