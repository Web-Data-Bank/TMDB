Through stories set in seven Italian communities throughout California, \"Finding the Mother Lode\" examines how economic and social mobility became possible for many Italians in the Golden State. It is also a look at how immigrant identity is maintained and transformed as immigrants become assimilated into mainstream America. The current film is a follow-up to the filmmakers' critically acclaimed \"Pane Amaro (Bitter Bread)\" on the Italian immigration to the East Coast. \"Finding the Mother Lode\" too, is based on extensive research and weaves together oral histories by community members with scholarly analyses which provide the larger historical context.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/31RVjjWUTFRVs1tPQgIi1jGhdQr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding the Mother Lode: Italian Immigrants in California","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
