Life on a farm is all that sullen teen Marco knows- leading a perfunctory and quiet life of working, going to school and avoiding the advances of girls. However, his self-imposed solitude ends when curly-haired Jakob, rejecting the banking world for farming, arrives to train on the farm. Although initially cautious and tentative with each other, it is soon obvious that the unspoken sexual tension is becoming increasingly hard to resist - something a spontaneous trip to Berlin. Proving that true love can blossom in even the most unlikely of places, Harvest is as rich and rewarding as it is heart-warming.","popularity":4.005,"poster_path":"/zVrdbqMjdaEE8VcFABbeloYKvvc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8697,"logo_path":"/dedjnLn70UGdQ5d0PBELGkEOzhf.png","name":"Salzgeber \u0026 Co.
