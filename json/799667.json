His father, nineties idol Bone, disappeared 24 years ago, leaving behind a half-written song. Because of this, Zhen Ying won't let Gei play the guitar or pursue rock music, leading to constant arguments between the two. Though he has no money himself, Gei is always trying to help out his buddies, and even secretly uses his mother's property to guarantee his friend's debt. One day, after enraging both his mom and girlfriend (Beatrice Fang), Gei gets super drunk and on his way home, he sees a man crying for help in Tamsui River. Gei rescues the man (Chris Wu) and finds that he looks exactly like his father! Bony's sudden arrival changes the family in unexpected ways, even as he constantly badgers Gei to help him return to the past.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":"/iMz8LYVx7CNn4cNGUaN0WsdLxw3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2016-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the River Flows","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
