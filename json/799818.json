In most of the cases he fails to frame himself as good enough a man to the girls he come across and gets disillusioned on all the occasions. Finally, he almost reaches a beautiful girl to a close proximity, but unfortunately, no sooner had he succeeded to win the girl's attention, he becomes blind in the curse of God.","popularity":1.434,"poster_path":"/h6vIwig3xFvWwhQFqoQJeN98gps.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2000-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Y2K (Athoba, 'Sex Krome Aasitechhe')","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
