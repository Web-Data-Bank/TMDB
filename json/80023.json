The documentary focused on visits by the poet Cathal Ó Searcaigh to Nepal during which he had close relationships with many young boys of 16 years old or younger. The documentary questioned whether Ó Searcaigh's relationships with these youths were exploitative and whether they demonstrated a power and wealth imbalance between the 50 year old Ó Searcaigh and the young Nepalese. Ó Searcaigh is presented in the documentary as paying for the housing, food, bicycles and clothing of boys at most 16 years old. He mentions on camera having sex with some of them, denying that he abused them or that he coerced them into having sex with him.","popularity":1.016,"poster_path":"/aFJHa4T9OmZ7wi8FXGXqJpqVkMI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"},{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not every fairytale has a happy ever after","title":"Fairytale of Kathmandu","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
