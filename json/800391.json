Grizzlies once reigned unchallenged as the top predators of Yellowstone, but everything changed when an old rival returned to the landscape. After almost a century without them, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone and again play a vital role in the ecosystem that depends upon them. Once the sole rulers of this vast kingdom, grizzly bears are now re-learning how to cope with the rise of an equal competitor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grizzly Cauldron","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
