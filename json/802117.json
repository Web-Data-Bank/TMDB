The two-hour-and-a-half-hours upbeat concert, embellished with grand LED displays and well-curated costumes for the performers, may well be considered at par with foreign acts. Billy, Sam, and James-who each had their focal moments onstage-did not disappoint. Even guest artists such as the PPop Generation, the ZPop Girls, Coleen Garcia, Yassi Pressman, and Nadine Lustre gave out performances worthy of the audience's money.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nXGrRUt4kpx3kZmxKp0NZHMXEcK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2019-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cr3w: Live in Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
