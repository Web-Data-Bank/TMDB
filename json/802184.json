But it is mainly a film about life and choices. We follow, for a year, three ordinary lives, ready each day for something extraordinary, three guardian angels that fly on board a helicopter, simply to offer assistance. Over the noise of the emergency, the film narrates a radical choice, that of Silvia, an emergency intensive care anaesthetist, involving in every instance the thread of life, of waiting, of solitude.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Xl2P4EHugxvS4Jh9W1J20e3VTE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Wire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
