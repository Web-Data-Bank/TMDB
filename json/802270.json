His effort is ludicrous because of the fact that his talent is all recruited from the help in the hotel. Roscoe, the cook, is forced to appear in a dress suit and when Al St. John appears from the bar there is a lively rivalry between the two for the applause of the crowd. Mabel, the waitress, vies with a professional dancer from the city. Into this setting comes William Jefferson, a polished sharper, who takes the innocent Mabel by storm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qfCTQ1VR1O67yrZMThbTmLeBrSo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Some Queen - and then some!\"","title":"Bright Lights","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
