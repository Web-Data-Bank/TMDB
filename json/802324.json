He’s a grumpy man,  full of aches and pains and is very rough with his patients. One night, he’s involved in a road collision with 30 year old delivery man Mario. While uninjured, Mario's bicycle is destroyed, and Pierfrancesco's sciatica flares up, making it impossible for him to drive. With both of their jobs in jeopardy, the doctor has an idea that could help them both: “remotely guided” by Pierfrancesco via wireless headset, Mario will visit his patients, and they’ll also carry out Mario’s delivery in Pierfrancesco’s car. After a range of daring (mis)adventures, they will learn to support each other, and the night will end with their lives both changed for the better.","popularity":3.813,"poster_path":"/jHao5iDtYN8MTydvuMSdIZ6W0JI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6246,"logo_path":"/7X6pfxldTiOD7MLo2EQqUQlmOUw.png","name":"Medusa Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":2534,"logo_path":"/6aizJC0RRO5oprJMYf2PBAB7lyZ.png","name":"Colorado Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor on Call","video":false,"vote_average":6.153,"vote_count":95}
