The film was made in parallel with 'The New Boys' and intersects with it at several points. However, instead of looking at the group, it explores the thoughts and feelings of Abhishek, a 12-year-old from Nepal, during his first days and weeks as a Doon student. This is at once the story of the encounter between a filmmaker and his subject and a glimpse of the mind of a child at “the age of reason”. This is the most intimate and interactive film of the series.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nJMS95WJL79nTBmF6O0An82qS22.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Age of Reason","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
