The Medical Examiner's conclusion: accidental death. But Louise won't accept this, knowing her daughter's complete phobia of water. She is determined to uncover the truth alone: Safa was murdered. Louise adopts a false name to find a job at the winegrower's where her daughter worked and soon figures out the complex relations that tied Safa to her employers' family. A family seemingly founded on secrets. The motive and murder seem obvious. But what if things weren't so simple...? Louise will stop at nothing for the truth to be revealed and the murderer arrested; even going so far as to dig up old stories and another well covered-up murder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pour ma fille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
