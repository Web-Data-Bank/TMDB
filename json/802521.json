Uses music and lyrics to describe struggles with mental health / finding hope. I collected lyrics for a couple months that I connected with and helped me understand and describe my struggles with mental health. Then I stitched them together in a poem of sorts. The poem as well as the imagery are jumpy and mimic what goes on in a spiral or panic attack (at least for me) as I move through.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hear Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
