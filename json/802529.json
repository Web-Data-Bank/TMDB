Preceded by Schoenbergs Accompaniment to a Cinematographic Scene, Op. 34, Zemlinskys Romantic score is full of psychological intrigue. Is Der Zwerg a critique of societys superficiality? Is it the composers self-portrait in his doomed affair with Alma Schindler? Director Tobias Kratzers stunning, transparent production creates a space in which each character is thrown into sharp relief in this fine, noble and melancholy work.","popularity":0.851,"poster_path":"/fKuF1E2hGa5cA5C7xGQDjqXutFi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Zwerg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
