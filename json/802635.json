When the smoke cleared, four of the German ships had sunk, including the flagship and pride of the German fleet, the SMS Scharnhorst. For decades, none of the downed vessels were ever found. Now, more than 100 years later, maritime archaeologist Mensun Bound and his team are searching for the ships and the secrets they hold. It's a race against time and the raging South Atlantic Ocean.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lLnyhVr2oqK6xMX3WQ9O4ykuGDx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunt For the Lost Superfleet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
