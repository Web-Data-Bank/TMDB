Neither an opera nor an operetta, it was a work that did not fit into any of the pre-defined categories. On the 100th anniversary of the composer's death in 1999, the Zurich opera house presented a new production, the work's Swiss premiere. This production picked up on various impulses from the history of the works origin, using them to create a unique version of the piece. Here, for example, is the \"Donauweibchen\" incorporated shortly before the end. The Austrian-born chief conductor of the Zurich opera house, Franz Welser-Möst, has left his mark as a native speaker on this \"Simplicius\" production both here and elsewhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kEX42KoWIzBuCHFqE0EeXAYJQ51.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johann Strauss: Simplicius","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
