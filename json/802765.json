In his modern staging, producer David Alden has resorted to all kinds of magic tricks. The mourning Almirena, for example, is suspended like a paralysed mermaid in a neon-blue water tank for her aria Lascia ch'io pianga. Armida constantly struggles to make her obstinate pet Hydra see reason, and no expense is spared on the stylishly artistic dance interludes. The characters move in an ironic blend of Twenties look, trendy club scene and sacro' kitsch. Unsurprisingly, opera-goers were quick to latch onto such a glittering and star studded production. Indeed, there can be no doubt that the American David Daniels is the undisputed star of this Munich production, even alongside the other famous names on the cast list.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6hzuzF1gr71yea3iZFswGhrixMg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handel: Rinaldo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
