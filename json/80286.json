The second episode is the most notorious and, consequently, gave the film its controversial poster – featuring a rabbit slowly disappearing under the skirt of a teenage girl (played by Gaelle Legrand). The third and final episode, which has a modern-day setting, is the shortest – but also, possibly, the most outrageous: Pascale Christophe is a young married woman who’s abducted on a busy Parisian street by a small-time hood hidden inside a cardboard box!","popularity":5.67,"poster_path":"/4SdiuMMZWgzYDYIUtDvE96zRunh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Argos Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":156806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Jeudi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Immoral Women","video":false,"vote_average":5.481,"vote_count":26}
