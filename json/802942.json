Fueled by her growing obsession, real-life interviews transform into music videos, ancient spiritual texts become fevered fantasies of synchronized swimming, and a vivid, vulnerable work of art is born from the unique perspective of an artist watching the global financial collapse up close.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/g2j6zKKAnKmRyUqYK0ZqqlMb1yF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A mystical meta-musical about the biggest financial fraud in history.","title":"A Kaddish for Bernie Madoff","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
