Using images of my own backyard, I found that I could create a kind of mysterious story, an almost supernatural effect. The mystery is never revealed, but there is something there. By photographing tiny vertical slivers through different mattes and lenses, carefully rewinding the film in the camera, then exposing bit by bit, I achieved this ‘corrugated’ effect. All of a sudden you get motion in something where there is no motion.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vByMeA8LCPbsgU9ZDVY4Qz5EAdO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Backyard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
