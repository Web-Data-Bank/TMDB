The hair buns tear at the scalp and the newest hits play on a small radio. It’s the golden 50ies and Victor has his hair salon in perfect order – or so it seems. Because from her first day at the new job, Paula just can’t take her eyes off the strange jukebox in the corner. She senses that the machine is somehow connected to a dark secret.
