He starts with making his own kind of please-turn-off-your-cell-phone announcement, as well as a warning not to text or tweet during the show: “Just live your life,” he asks. Whether he’s talking about a unique way to drop a rental car off at an airport or describing why a man in his 40s should not smoke dope, it’s terrific, humane, carried-to-crazed-extremes stuff.","popularity":5.33,"poster_path":"/zCJHwMaxqo8uewyjpRzhNLeM9jw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pig Newton","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cicrus King Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-12-10","revenue":1000000,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Buy The Thing","title":"Louis C.K.: Live at the Beacon Theater","video":false,"vote_average":7.838,"vote_count":204}
