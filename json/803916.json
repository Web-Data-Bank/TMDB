As an ordinary day in this city unfolds, the voices of these women take us beyond the everyday we dwell in, into the lived experiences they inhabit. Moving beyond the one-dimensional perception of sex workers, these women are also lovers, daughters, therapists, entrepreneurs, and educators. By shedding light on the humanity, dignity, and power of this marginalised and underserved community, their stories teach us one thing - love and life come in various shades.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pItQCSkZFCgikh8RFRblC97litZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shades of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
