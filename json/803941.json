In 1970, after the state of California issued a warrant for Davis’s arrest and she was subsequently placed on the FBI’s most-wanted list, she went into hiding. In her public absence, her image was endlessly reproduced and disseminated as she was stalked by the State. Using archival imagery and fictionalized first-person accounts of the FBI agent who pursued her, Fusco’s formally inventive, sardonic, and fantastical short is a send-up of the surveillance state and weaponized imagery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kBp8LWdLqrkKNbRSmAhk3CyEYbk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"a/k/a Mrs. George Gilbert.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
