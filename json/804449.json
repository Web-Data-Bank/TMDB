Rather, Jadin meets Ashley, the ultimate con artist. This good, clean, Christian story uses the best comedic gaffs, including nosy neighbors, hearing voices in your head, and the worst nightmare of having one's house and life taken over by cons. It is rich in humor and self-inflicted misery that ends happily ever after.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fbv64gg5CiV5WZIw6iXhyflZSOV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Takeover","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
