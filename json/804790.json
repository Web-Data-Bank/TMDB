The machines, with their sonority, rhythms, tunes and automated movements, become musicians and dancers in a show that drive the film to play its cinematic score. The soundtrack, composed with workshops sounds only, unfolds as a musical masterpiece performed by machines for iron and bolt dancers, all coming together in a majestic mechanic choreography. The man who conceived and created these « iron monsters » occupies a fragile place in this powerful, metallic world, which is at the same time incredibly beautiful and musical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8m7qpgaC7Kztb1geR8wibaocKgL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gachot Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music Boxes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
