We know the industry rose again as a pale, commercial version of its old self, butâ€¦ did you ever wonder what it was like back in the wild days when the titans of gaming clashed, not on Wall Street, but inside the minds of designers? Want to learn first hand how the barren valley south of The Bay gave birth to cult celebrity that died as quickly as it was born? Take the ride with the folks who made it happen. Walk on walls, smoke the evil weed, and plunge head first into the uncharted (undocumented) world that was game production back in the bad old days.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rbIOZ4zOLn6GA3U24MvgOFTVIvz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The uncensored story of what happened behind the scenes at Atari","title":"Once Upon Atari","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":5}
