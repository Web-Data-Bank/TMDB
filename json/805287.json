The cause? Human environmental impact, the product of consumption times population. Many environmentalists focus on our excessive consumption, but discussing the latter factor in the equation - population - has fallen out of vogue. Welcome to environmentalism's radical fringe: the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement and the Church of Euthanasia. Armed with slogans like \"Thank You For Not Breeding\" and \"Live Long and Die Out,\" their ideas are usually greeted with laughter or hostility. But beneath the silliness, do they have a point? Through humorous animation and live-action interviews with academics, economists, and activists across the political spectrum, \"Thank You For Not Breeding\" takes a new look at our species, our environment, and our future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3MKm4dQyCMMIajWoLKI053Xuubh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thank You for Not Breeding","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
