Also, some footage by a young film-maker in Boston, Tom Chomont, his footage (unedited) for Night Blossoms. I was particularly impressed with Mr. Chomont’s footage  because it reminded me of the painting (form and color) of Odilon Redon. Too often, the young new American film-maker  will leave too many things to chance, thus avoiding that most import ant principle that, I fear, is lacking  today in not only the amateur fields, but also in the professional, and that is arete, or excellence.\" (Gregory J.
