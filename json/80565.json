The atmosphere of the performance is great, with the bands and fans coming together after Richey's disappearance to create a wonderful, tense, sad and beautiful mood. Musically the Manics rock out with excellent versions of 7 of their best songs to date when the video was made and 6 tracks from the aforementioned then-new album, with Elvis Impersonator and No Surface All Feeling the picks of these.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manic Street Preachers - Everything Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
