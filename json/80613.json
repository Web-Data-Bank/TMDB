During a stop at a lonesome garage he meets Estella, who is supposed to marry a few days later. However she'd rather come with him - to meet a former boyfriend in another town, she says. Expecting problems, he refuses to take her, but she tricks him into it and then tries hard to convince him of her qualities and let her stay with him.","popularity":2.153,"poster_path":"/4pcOEi6LNNg3hI9elI3gTdbeiQ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14,"logo_path":"/m6AHu84oZQxvq7n1rsvMNJIAsMu.png","name":"Miramax","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12474,"logo_path":null,"name":"J\u0026M Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":35984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Los Films Del Camino","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1989-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eversmile, New Jersey","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":10}
