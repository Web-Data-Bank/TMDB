The romance of Robert and his android partner, Jenny, unfolds against the backdrop of a world where advanced technology is both a source of and a “cure” for human alienation. Advertisements come in the form of pop-up thoughts, entire cities float on islands of trash, and female forms are purchased and discarded at will. The piece takes its title from iTMRW, the ultra mega-corporation that produces and sells every single thing known to man. Amazon, Google, and Facebook hooked up with the U.S government, made ugly, ugly love, and spawned a demon baby.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/iMrgLib2lGXdlGWgAhrcpZD38YS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"iTMRW: A Sci-Fi Ballet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
