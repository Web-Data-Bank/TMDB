But his father is a hardcore Southern Baptist, and during his teen years, Jesus rebels, joining a biker gang and leading an LSD-fueled pilgrimage to the West to fight the establishment. Anyone who adopts the initials J.C. as a nickname probably has a Messianic complex. In Iron Horseman, the hero, the head of a motorcycle gang, wigs out on LSD. While day-tripping, he has a prophetic religious vision. This leads him back to his home town, where he challenges the local church leaders-even unto knocking down chairs and tables in righteous anger, just like....you know.","popularity":1.36,"poster_path":"/6nzR7SizUdsTWDLvjYCo3LUyUz0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140468,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wilmac International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“J.C.” preached love… lived violence!!","title":"J.C.","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
