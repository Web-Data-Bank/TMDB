The film is a form of visual diary, taking the viewers on a journey of realizations regarding the filmmaker's difficult family relations, gender and sexual identity, and lack of control. It reflects on shame, guilt, and the experience of queerness in a conservative, Catholic setting, as well as on the concepts of migration and re-rooting. The filmmaker uses this deeply personal and moving film to reflect on whether it's possible to fully accept one's fate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tBQrkt4VSMicfGiBUfTaPDW5lTz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"42 Days","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
