When two boys are left home alone with Grandpa going about his usual business in antiques and collectibles, their improvised ball game results in the breaking of a precious vase. Sly big brother attempts to lay the blame on little brother, by hook and by crook, but Grandpa is as savvy a collector as he is a guardian. The little culprits duly accept their punishment, the blows cushioned by a padding of good humour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pSHhMvWS5lrRXxD3tcM7jjGCY5j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2012-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
