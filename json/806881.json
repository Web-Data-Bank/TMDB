It is half a tale that finally takes on the form sought by Emmer (the tale of a pigeon between two wars), and half a processual film in which we see Picasso create a mural that only exists in this film. Incontrare Picasso (Meeting Picasso) with the voice-over in the first person points towards the full expository and discursive authorship of Emmer’s two main essays: Bella di notte and Con aura…senz'aura.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p75lOLoBiuvOrVaRS8pGp6UhhXG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incontrare Picasso","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
