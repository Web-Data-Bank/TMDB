Hours later she collapsed in the over 107 degree heat and by day's end she was dead. Even though an internal investigation carried out by the Arizona Department of Corrections revealed that prison guards had denied her water and ridiculed her when she pleaded for help, no one was held accountable. The story of how Marcia came to be incarcerated and the circumstances of her death reveal the impact that inhumane prison conditions are having on a wide range communities of sex workers—including the homeless, young people, transgender people and immigrants—across the United States. The documentary NO HUMAN INVOLVED chronicles how a movement formed around this case, seeking justice in her name.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4HeHb4aUogGgwZXHFYCMxE6FqTn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NO HUMAN INVOLVED","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
