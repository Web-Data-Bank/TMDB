Angela Carter’s quote counterpoints fundamentalist voices; shots of hothouse flowers play over a born-again doctor’s commentary on the ins and outs of gay male carnality. This humorless spew of a turgid imagination was lifted from The Gay Agenda, an agit-prop tape circulated in the Senate by Christian conservatives. A collision of disco hooks, floating quotes, and fertile nature, Confirmed Bachelor lovingly smothers their moralistic posturing under a blanket of blooms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nkP7dszWMRZILLoVhzCb91DOEUS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confirmed Bachelor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
