In an old smugglers' cave, the children happen to overhear a radio message that refers to the abduction of George’s father Quentin. The professor has set up a laboratory on Kirrin Island where he’s doing research on a new energy generation method. Someone has obviously taken great interest in the valuable research results. But neither the police nor George’s mother Fanny believe the children. They are now on their own and discover a conspiracy that almost takes their breath away.","popularity":5.612,"poster_path":"/rkpZ33Ph5wFi85NZvHDA27aoKSq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8234,"logo_path":null,"name":"SamFilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-01-25","revenue":7863913,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Famous Five","video":false,"vote_average":6.605,"vote_count":38}
