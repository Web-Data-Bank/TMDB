The poetic, fragmented style and structure of the film represent the exile's internal struggle to \"reconstitute\" her own sense of self in relation to her history and ancestry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GY","name":"Guyana"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coconut/Cane & Cutlass","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
