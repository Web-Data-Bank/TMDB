High school memories start to come back, with memories of teenage delinquency. The young Anton was a smart student, handsome and a playboy. He tutored female friends in his house. One of them was Anggra, the daughter of a widow, whose brother was the young Indra. Indra did not fancy Anggra studying with Anton. But the pressure from Ina and her mother made him relent. Apparently his suspicion comes true when Anton is charged for raping Anggra. After being investigated, Anton admits that the rape did not happen and it was just a way to show off. Indra marries Ina, the girl who used to avoid him. As a result of the incident, Anton and Anggra have also become close. However, there is almost no story in this film and only fragments of memories are weaved together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6xoX63wb9cR8Kxk3bRoLQKQb7g5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147351,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Japos Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1980-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nostalgia di SMA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
