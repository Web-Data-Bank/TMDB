The main protagonists of the film are the artist’s parents who do not speak English and read the jokes from transliterated title cards and have went through the Nakba (1948) and the Naksa (1967) and never shared their memories from these major events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uFrSbqfWJwGcC4ml8CEJ6YkNzzO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trouble in Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
