Memories of New York and San Francisco are the backdrop for seven dramatic scenes which designate the intersection of community support, medical science, and gay politics that emerged in response to the AIDS epidemic. Words and images from these scenes resonate throughout the documentary portraits which follow. The interviews, conducted in Toronto and San Francisco (1993-1994), feature artists, filmmakers, AIDS community workers, writers and volunteers who have made unique contributions within the cultural and community responses to AIDS.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dP32xHLDkd3QGYkIX5AqCXwoLA2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Positive Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
