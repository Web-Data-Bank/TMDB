Young men from across the country (some inanely misogynistic and others completely innocent) were slaughtered-strangled, stabbed and even dismembered by the blood-lust of these two mentally deranged siblings. Now in 2016 the killing spree continues-only it isn't the Sicole Sisters responsible for the current murders, but rather their psychopathic followers-a full-fledged cult that has assembled to honor the sisters and their vicious vendetta.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AeEJn6pnQGizLjLF7Y0KyAJlhMR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cult of the Psycho Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
