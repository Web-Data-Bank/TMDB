His stay lasted for 25 years. During that period, Rafet has educated four young immigrant children about philosophy, psychology, politics, and arts, and those boys are now in their 30s. Oktay is the aggressive Döner-Cutter/Philosopher; Adem is stubborn, working in a fast-food restaurant; Riza is cold, Frosty, trying to be a taxi driver for 10 years. Kalender is a good father though depressed, who cleans toilets. Their intersection is their commitment to Rafet: he is a father, an idol, or an übermensch, or a troublesome old man. The film aims to document the lives of those characters, each very unique, and the key themes are immigration, loneliness, culture differences, family life, and longing for \"heimat\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8SagLi1o1avDSkX5oHBO0tlqjC1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Rafet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
