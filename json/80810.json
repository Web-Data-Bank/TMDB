The aunt, still traumatised by the death by drowning, years earlier, of her own two sons, has little idea how to handle the boy. As if, losing his parents and not really feeling welcome in his new home, were not enough, the boy is bullied at school. He seeks sanctuary from all of his troubles in the open air, in the company of wolves and particularly in the presence of a young wolf whose life he has saved.","popularity":0.683,"poster_path":"/899mbVyNAEsCWQ9wHpafxi2DbWy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time of the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":7}
