Can we refresh a film, as we say of a computer screen? One can for example say the film, tell its manufacture and its hazards during a conference. Traité d'optique is a film conference that questions the conditions of possibility of a film revival by crossing material culture and utopia, media archaeology and family narrative, about a study film made in 1987. If the conference sometimes replaces the film, can the film itself be a conference?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mNrJT8rU6osVsKIHR2PMmymQf56.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Traité d'optique","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
