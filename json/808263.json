These songs express gratitude to the bees, enticing and imploring them to give up their sweetness and maintain their seasonal visits.  This film is the outcome of a long-term collaboration between researchers Balthasar Kehi and Lisa Palmer and the people of Balthasar's homeland of Lookeu. It portrays a border community who, despite changing farming practices and increasing commodification, are determined to maintain the bees' movement across the region and preserve their shared identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jIkDjvk8yMDsLht22PBinD7C0Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"TL","name":"Timor-Leste"}],"release_date":"2019-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Honey: Caring for Bees in a Divided Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
