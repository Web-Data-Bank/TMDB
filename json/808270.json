Even though the project hasn’t yet been completed, right from the start I felt very close to this subject. I’m not talking about the emotional aspect of rage, nor its interpretation in a revolutionary key. Instead, I’m referring to a silent and constitutive rage. Los justos by Jorge Luis Borges was a poem which guided me as I wrote the short, like a serene expression of a radical state of rebellion, composed of the renunciation of power and violence.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eCHyfcDfXbc4OKVqXK33VRp6qv4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2010-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A peaceful home life is suddenly interrupted by the words of a political rally.
