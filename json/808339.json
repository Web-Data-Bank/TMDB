The Steppenwolf Theater Company's production featuring the original Broadway cast.  Desperately proud, but reduced to poverty by the loss of their farm, the Joads pile their few possessions on a battered old truck and head west for California, hoping to find work and a better life. Led by the indomitable Ma Joad, who is determined to keep the family together at any cost, and by the volatile young Tom Joad, an ex-convict who grows increasingly impatient with the intolerance and exploitation that they encounter on their trek, the Joads must deal with death and terrible deprivation before reaching their destinationâ€”where their waning hopes are dealt a final blow by the stark realities of the Great Depression.","popularity":0.951,"poster_path":"/fL5V6o7NdPIVTODNEnxbUiiXNnH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3398,"logo_path":null,"name":"FNM Films","origin_country":""},{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"},{"id":614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vanguard Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grapes of Wrath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
