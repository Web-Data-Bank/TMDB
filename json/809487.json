Profoundly  disturbed,  brainwashed  and  weaponized  by  the  abuse  he  endured,  he  displays violent hatred towards the world around him, and particular revulsion for his mother, who was held hostage alongside him. Imad considers himself to be an ISIS fighter and lashes out against children and adults alike in this intense horror film about a child possessed by terror. As menacing as his behaviour is, it is a mere imitation of the humiliation and brutality he was moulded by. He did exactly as he was  told  by  ISIS  in  order  to  survive,  and  now,  surrounded  by  other  survivors,  the  love of his family and help from a therapist, will he thrive?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gOStfbBitIJ8CpMK92ku6rwG2yU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128444,"logo_path":null,"name":"AVB Production AB","origin_country":""},{"id":128443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fenixfilm","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2021-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imad's Childhood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
