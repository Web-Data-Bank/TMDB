The snow was a gift to the island meant to enchant Puerto Rican children with a “white” American Christmas. The spectacle represented an unfair economic transaction: planes brought capitalist instant gratification in the form of snow, and returned to the U.S. filled with the Puerto Rican cheap labor that would populate el barrio. Puerto Rico’s colonial captivity is condensed in the “gift” of melting snow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9xaSYR26sJjWJyrpXERwVLKeUqn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2021-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melting Snow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
