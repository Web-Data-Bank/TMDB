The second third is a combined picture printed twice onto the same film strip (the second printing being in another tone and shifted back one frame) and the third section is a combined image printed in a similar way thrice. The length of Retour d'un repère composé is necessary : in the process of viewing the film the work gathers momentum thus giving access to a more intricate visual experience. \"Composed recurrence\" is a rough translation of Retour d'un repère composé as one loses the \"point of reference\" aspect concerning \"repère\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Retour d'un repère composé","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
