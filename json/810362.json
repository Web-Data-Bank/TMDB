Obentos have been made somewhere in kitchens in towns every morning.  One day for an obento made with a quite elaborate hand;  One day for an obento made with a quick, simple hand;  One day for an obento left behind on a table by a careless forgetful hand;  One day without an obento because of “someone’s” oversleeping.  An obento stays close beside us day by day.  but strangely enough, an obento is quite common and a matter of course.  This film is dedicated to all those people as “someone” who makes an obento.","popularity":0.661,"poster_path":"/reb8EHoghYCPvfUgdqPnfNSwUCl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lunch Box","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
