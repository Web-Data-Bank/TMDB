In this work Hoël plays a high-wire game with her fellow researchers Darragh O'Donoghue and Henry Miller, exploring the nature of their mutual obsession; filmmaker Stephen Dwoskin, whose life and fictive world bleeds into their encounter through a series of interventions in disconcerting and hilarious ways. Part interview, part therapy session, the work creates a shifting power play of fiction and reality, staging and improvisation, pulling at and revealing the nature and tensions within a set of real relationships.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acting Out: Stephen Dwoskin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
