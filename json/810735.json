The meeting with the author, director, poet and philosopher, famous in the artistic world for his stubborn independence, with the young writer Stefano Scanu, gave rise to a long conversation about cinema, about life, about our future, about some of his films chosen as a tribute to the festival. This short film acquires a further value due to the sad coincidence of the definitive closure of the Azzurro Scipioni theatre a few days later, a mourning for all passionate and romantic Romans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A3kWzMl3fwOTyPsgBX0LW3U2qDE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incontro con Silvano","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
