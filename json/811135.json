The Travelling Cinematograph of Bioscope was a popular attraction, so it is no wonder that a camera was on hand to record this salvage operation. The film shows a Burrell's Showman's Road Locomotive - used for hauling fairground equipment from site to site - being rescued from a ditch. The sophistication of the shot sequencing suggests either a later filming date than 1900, or at the very least some fortuitous in-camera editing. As a record of an incident of life on the road for the early champions of film, it is invaluable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9vDUPCw13wSepWAGM8sUHV3jUfd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1900-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salvaging a Steamroller","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
