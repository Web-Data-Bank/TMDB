Martin Martin and Dane Cory were former partners in crime who have long since split up. When a new district attorney puts the heat on, Cory, anxious to save his own hide, accuses Martin of an unsolved murder. Holed up in abandoned house, Martin is befriended by a little girl and her dog. It so happens that the girl is the daughter of the crusading DA, and thereby hangs the rest of this tale.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/bHbRcsO99NMsL0lI4r1aLp1lACQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5426,"logo_path":null,"name":"Benedict Bogeaus Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SHE'LL NEVER BE IN JAIL... but every gorgeous inch of her is against the law!","title":"Johnny One-Eye","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":7}
