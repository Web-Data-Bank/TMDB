Delta Don, however, has the staying power of a good 70's pop tune. In spite of all odds, he inspires us to push harder, even if that takes us to the truck stops and rest areas along the I-75 in Georgia and Tennessee. A bittersweet, hummable comedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delta Don","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
