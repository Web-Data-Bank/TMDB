With this unprecedented access, Emmy-winning, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Robert B. Weide followed the notoriously private film legend over a year and a half to create the ultimate film biography. \"Woody Allen: A Documentary\" chronicles Allen's career - from teen writer to Sid Caesar's TV scribe, from stand-up comedian to award-winning writer-director averaging one film-per-year for more than 40 years. Exploring Allen's writing habits, casting, directing, and relationship with his actors first-hand, new interviews with A-listers, writing partners, family and friends provide insight and backstory to the usually inscrutable filmmaker.","popularity":7.771,"poster_path":"/s7IA3Ng2mLer8lt8j1BhsVulLqQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whyaduck Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":12007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rat Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":12323,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mike's Movies","origin_country":""},{"id":7407,"logo_path":"/6uSTdFHCifrdG43w2xy6Aog9QpT.png","name":"Insurgent Docs","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":192,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Comedy is easy.
