We start the journey from his home—an Ambulance parked outside a community centre—and venture across town to the local coffee shop.  We gain powerful insights from Andy as he weaves his way down the street, takes shortcuts through alleyways, runs through a forested ravine and skates uphill. \"It's the dead space I'm excited about.\" We observe how his attitude toward each spot—and every random encounter—brings them to life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mXQN8YtbLOWMzpiJMhoZTa4Zvul.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Powell Peralta","origin_country":""},{"id":151774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zenga Bros","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Many Worlds Are In Your World?","title":"Seen Him","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
