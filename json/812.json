Young 'street rat' Aladdin has dreams of being something nobler than a small marketplace thief. He discovers a bond with Princess Jasmine during a chance encounter, but is arrested for thievery by the palace guards soon after. In custody, Aladdin learns of a magical lamp that will grant him any wish he desires. Escaping from prison, he heads for the promised land in search of the mythical treasure, completely unaware that he is being manipulated by the Sultan’s sinister Grand Vizier, Jafar.","popularity":52.113,"poster_path":"/x5LLRJ2WSSDSb2kvq9zNQ4GS37q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2,"logo_path":"/wdrCwmRnLFJhEoH8GSfymY85KHT.png","name":"Walt Disney Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":171656,"logo_path":"/4UBohOtIr9DtxylH48Qsg6aDow6.png","name":"Walt Disney Feature Animation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-11-25","revenue":504050219,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wish granted!","title":"Aladdin","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":10286}
