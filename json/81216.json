The boy is in constant work which will fit him, and in the end becomes a petty thief who cannot pay his debts anymore and decides to steal from homes where he pays scheduled visits to lonely housewifes. The girl works a nurse but is too sensitive in extreme cases. Running parallel to their story is a metaphor involving a castaway on a junkyard, who tries every means possible to get rid of the dog which becomes attached to him. In the end he attaches sticks of dynamite to the dog, but he breaks loose and the explosion wipes them both.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/9cDH3NHbx3Pyh4954dvreoywHiF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespol Filmowy \"Iluzjon\"","origin_country":""},{"id":12838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Polski","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1972-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Kill This Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":8}
