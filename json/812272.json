They are of various parts of a domestic interior, tabletop, sofa, mantle-piece, kitchen sink etc. and are ordered as autonomous sequences of shots. As such they constitute a narrative.  The soundtrack, a series of domestic sounds and conversations constitutes a separate narrative. Occasionally sound and image coincide in different ways, but for the most part they are juxtaposed. The conversation will concern the relationship of two people living together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cup of Tea – A Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
