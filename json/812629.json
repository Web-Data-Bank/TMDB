Life and death, good and evil are evoked as the incantatory voiceovers and sordid images make reference to communion, transfusions, bloodbaths, bloodlust, vampires and the specter of a virus loose in contemporary culture. Steeped in paranoia and dread, this work describes a subconscious search that is, in Oursler's words, \"based on a movie, based on a book, based on a poem, based on a myth, which is based on the quest for human immortality.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/91mfTk2PBLiCQGkuV7TGL0AI5I4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sucker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
