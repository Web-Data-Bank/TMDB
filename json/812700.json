Growing up as the daughter of a civil rights lawyer and a blues musician, she developed a keen eye for the absurd and unjust. Now, with the release of her debut album, no one is safe from her pinpoint takedowns - her flower child mother, \"whore-ish\" friends, even herself. In the same blistering set she'll make you laugh about women in 1940s movies - and women in porn movies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rachel Feinstein - Thug Tears","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
