Each work is a stunning blend of comedy and pathos, challenging the boundaries of both genre and form. These groundbreaking shorts raise the bar for all animated films to follow.   While the wildly popular Sick & Twisted series (Full Frontal and Unprotected!) contains material for adults only, this collection is appropriate for a wider audience, albeit not children. The content is mild and the focus is on the art of the animation.  This is the first \"Best Of\" DVD issue of the Classic Animation festival, featuring top international and local animation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ztUmKyRTfNYadWafbLDj2F99N2S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spike and Mike's Cutting Edge Classics","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
