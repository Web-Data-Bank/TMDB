She's trapped in a mechanical and repetitive world when all she wants to do is slow down and spend time in the greenhouse. Inspired by the history of deforestation in Vermont, this film looks at what we stand to lose if we don't do something to help the planet, and what we lose in ourselves if disconnected from nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lW7ap7MoVk4krce4wxRPFY0dz1t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left of Center","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
