He dies shortly thereafter.  Mother and daughter mourn in the parental apartment, isolated on 49  square meters  — and connected to the outside world only by telephone. With painful intimacy, these phone calls exemplify the loneliness of the mourners in pandemic times. Photographic images of the desolate apartment are marked by an intense geometric strictness, which, in spite of the confinement, also creates a certain distance to the inevitable.  “27 STEPS“ thus leaves room for interpretation and deals with a universal question: How does isolation affect us when we are dependent on solace and help? This is a very personal film which puts a magnifying glass on the circumstances that we are all experiencing right now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4mHRjaOhIOQVRZbk3qiCfAqx0Ru.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"27 Steps","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
