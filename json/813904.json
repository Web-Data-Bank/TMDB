As that wave reached international shores, thousands of people came out to protest their own experiences of racism and violence.  This unmissable documentary is a searing and profoundly moving story from a political journalist, author, and filmmaker Stan Grant. In this deeply personal piece, Stan gives voice to the frustration and hurt that has defined the life experience of so many first nation people and explores why the death of George Floyd resonates so profoundly - “There in that moment he became every black life. There captured on video was every person enslaved…Every nameless faceless person who were told their lives did not matter.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Four Corners Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Can't Breathe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
