A martyr saint, a warrior.  Saint Efisio, an icon who moves the people.  A holiday, a rite which repeats outside of time and brings with it the masks of dominations past and present, of an island; Sardinia.  What escapes? What remains?  Question and answer is the foundation of editing  And renews the past in another past.  In this encounter of deferred glances, the holy day is renewed again in memory and in dream, far from known places.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/crLwkZmBXCOMzprH9vkl7XeEQE7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rondò Final","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
