This seems unlikely, given they are both homeless men mired in the bleak landscape of Los Angeles' Skid Row. Moreover, the source of Donald's optimism is a mere $20 bill (called a \"Jackson\") which he bummed off a passing businessman (Steve Guttenberg) earlier that day. But Donald vows that with it, they can do anything, and drags a reluctant Sam off in search of adventure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vdK7UWBz9R2xlKbf8DAGe1UU8FU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152123,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beltek Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":152124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danzel Phonographic Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is going to be the best day of your life.","title":"Jackson","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
