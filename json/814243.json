In an environment of devastated telluric forces (one-hundred-year-old trees from the Fontainebleau forest were uprooted by the storm of 1999 winter). There is a superb officiating priest in a black tuxedo. The film refers to the everlasting cycle of death, the extraction of a corpse by a young nymph remind’s us of Caravaggio’s paintings, this ceremony is full of ablutions and jewellery; a flowy, golden path to a wonderful mirror through which the miracle of resurrection takes place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le rituel de Fontainebleau","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
