Allegory intensified by the vertigo of the transgression, the mysteries of the sacred and the images of Baron Van Gloeden, Jean Genet and Michel Journiac, masters of funerary eroticism and body’s fury.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les amants rouges","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
