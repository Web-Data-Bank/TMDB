It's put to the test by the huge-dicked estate agent, a wild psychiatrist, an ardent motorcyclist and a group of foreign students overseas to study tongues.  How can you resist 14 young Europeans - Czech, German, Swiss, Italian, French? Enthusiasts both of strength and of tenderness - romantics and muscular hard men.  They follow their destinies, take each other, give each other, swap their sensual bodies with vigour, passion and - above all - no limits!  Love has no limit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bMZe43bLm1BNnI1RqnfUkoRJWk6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65668,"logo_path":"/qHpNaCy2IGoTdyQkI2eD972E7Va.png","name":"French Art","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without Limits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
