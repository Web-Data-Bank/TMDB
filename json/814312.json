Eleven years later, she receives an incredible request: one of the men who killed Juan wants to meet with her in the Nanclares de la Oca prison in Araba (Spain), where he is serving his sentence after breaking ties with the terrorist group.  Despite her reservations and her immense pain, Maixabel Lasa agrees to meet face to face with those who ended the life of the person who had been her companion since she was 16 years old. ‘Everyone deserves a second chance’, she said, when asked why she was willing to confront the man who killed her husband.","popularity":6.196,"poster_path":"/7lOcGma9G2yak5qB6ITwg3j0PDm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13287,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kowalski Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":152156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feelgood Media","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maixabel","video":false,"vote_average":7.118,"vote_count":76}
