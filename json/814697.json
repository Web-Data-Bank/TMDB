We tried to capture the Roller Derby culture with grungy 16mm film overlays and an eclectic mix of colors, switching from black and white, back to color. This, combined with the use of stock footage, the Whip It trailer and choice of music really help to sell the vibe and sensibilities of roller derby.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3zgOQuEzjZIFeHH7UwM2Bb6OAga.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imperial Finch Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ROLLER DERBY IN THE LOW COUNTRIES","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
