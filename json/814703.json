We will reveal the details of the next album and broadcast exclusive images of the new short film \"Black Wave\" and the book to be released in late 2021/early 2022!

Post-apocalyptic costumes, a martial metal as dancing as percussive, dancefloor beats where acid and devastating synths are mixed, such are the ingredients which compose the scenic universe of the group.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y4lhjpRy30kSIfcGS876JDYg6I1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Music","title":"Sha창rghot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
