There is certainly no word of a plot or unambiguous content. Influenced by the Italian film maker Michelangelo Antonioni, he draws a picture here of mental and physical oppression. A monitor in an empty room alternately shows the faces of a woman and a man. Their lips are moving, but you cannot hear their voices. Their faces are 'blindfolded', and 'tied up' with a rope which is fastened around the monitor. Then there are images of the woman in the empty room in which she looks at herself on the screen and in a broken mirror. Locked up in this circuit and her own thoughts, she is unable to make contact.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6KLA7HNuJdLsQCWbC4F2AxzgJxl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Traumasyl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
