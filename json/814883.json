Juxtaposing film clips from the 20s through the 80s, HOLLYWOOD HAREMS explores the organization of gender, race, and sexuality in Hollywood's portrayal of the exotic east an indiscriminate fusion of things Arab, Persian, Chinese and Indian.  In abridging cultural plurality and difference, these technicolor fantasies have worked both to shape and reinforce often derogative assumptions about peoples of the east while at the same time reinscribing the moral, spiritual, and cultural supremacy of the Anglo-European west.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1nERMZ8cIsjFTmcXZvMMwJTTLCZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood Harems","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
