But when it opened, it dawned on everyone that the audience itself was the actual work in the iconic performance artist’s landmark exhibition. The audience members were also active participants and co-creators of the social experiment, which - set against the minimalist background of the gallery’s empty space - developed continuously into new, unpredictable directions during the three weeks (or 512 hours) in which the exhibition took place, while Abramović herself took part in the performative ritual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nETqzCu0t7tH6tSurN4hV4HRGbs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"512 Hours","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
