But the two brothers are at very different places in their lives. Popal was granted asylum in Denmark a long time ago and he is a fighter full of dreams for the future. Darmal, on the other hand, has just arrived in Denmark, with a heavy heart and lots of insecurities about his future. When Darmal’s asylum case is rejected, the brothers’ dream of a future together shatters. With a caring pastoral couple, as his closest allies, the ever so resourceful Popal gets hold of a human rights lawyer and goes all in on keeping Darmal above water. But can reality match the brothers’ dream of a future together? And is Darmal still the same brother, he once was so close with? With sibling love as its driving force – and the pastoral couple as mediators when the brothers clash - Kathrine Ravn Kruse’s gripping film is a story about a brother’s struggle not to lose his little brother once again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ldc7XFPYv2E8qogrj7lMVgPPtiq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Follow You Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
