After sixty years of selfless work in a largely hostile environment, something seems to have gone terribly wrong. Habituated to living under the protective wings of the mission, the Ayoreos seem neither to be willing to support themselves and start living on their own, nor able to return to their traditional way of life in the jungle. Dressed in second-hand clothes, they are stranded in the backwoods of Western-style civilization, with no particular way to go.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/odpPAEd2RDHmbxUWqhpXCUDY9xs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jaguar's Corner","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
