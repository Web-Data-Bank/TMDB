Here, they are given the task of staging human rights in a collective performance. First, they must agree on how to interpret the rights, both artistically and politically – and then it suddenly makes a difference if you come from Syria or Denmark, even if you are not aware of it yourself. The director Camille Bildsøe observes with an attentive presence how empathy and tolerance come about during the process. And, not least, how both can make an active difference in the real world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/acynzeLiBzrL0UZMDW67cDdAZlr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Wish The World Was a Paper Plane","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
