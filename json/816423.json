A hedonistic paradise in Ibiza, where tourists and professional dancers live out both a collective and individual fantasy about freedom in an artificial setting. Freja Sofie Kirk and Esben Weile Kjær’s video work analyses the commercial logic deeply embedded in the promise of happiness – and the desire – upon which the entertainment industry is built. Privilege is also a workplace where young employees have clear roles in the machinery. The dancers’ bodies are transformed into scenographic objects, which melt together in a gigantic choreography that includes cranes and a giant inflatable shark. ‘Industries of Freedom’ also looks at nightlife from the inside, with the collective out-of-body experience taking on a transformative and ecstatic aspect – like a take on the great common rituals of our times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ueCohHFGP48kEGC4SZA6f0KzZEr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Industries of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
