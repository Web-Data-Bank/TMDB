With her brown eyes and dark hair, she stood out from the rest of her family, where everyone is blonde – apart from her Iranian father. The only thing is: she has never met him, and until recently, the prospect of doing so has not kept her awake at night. But now, as a 28-year-old, Ida is starting to look for answers to all the unresolved questions about her father – and herself. A trip to Iran is the start of an inner journey, which takes her to unexpected places. She works her way closer and closer to her absent Iranian father with self-effacing humour and sincerity in a personal film about finding oneself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hvf1YD4TxRS8uOd78cTXjk326ek.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iranian Daddy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
