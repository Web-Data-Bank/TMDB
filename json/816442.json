Contemporary television resembles a gigantic farm; the lure of success and fame which it offers is analogous to Pinocchio's experience when he was assured that he would never have to work again (lifelong entertainment) - and was transformed into a donkey! Individuality does not exist; Don Quichotte is not alone in believing in windmills.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Que Sera Sera","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
