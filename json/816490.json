But what was it like to hold Ramadan in a year of restrictions, prohibitions and social distancing? Six young Muslims express their thoughts and feelings about a different kind of year when communal meals and prayer lines were replaced by a quarantine that pulls the individual relationship with God into focus.

And what kind of spirituality do we dare imagine in a society that moves further and further away from believing in God?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/voyPTkm3NWrxdBjpU8UIZOrYl8b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ramdan Muslim - in Quarantine with God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
