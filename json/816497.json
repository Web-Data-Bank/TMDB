Or is her death just another twist in a saga of blood revenge? In the Albanian mountains, the ancient tribal law Kanun rules, and even though the killer is behind bars, the last word in the case has not been spoken. Religious and legal authorities - like the families involved - have their own powerful and conflicting interests in the controversial law, which is a taboo both in church and modern society. The question, however, is if the young woman’s father can find the faith to not only forgive his cousin, but also reconcile himself with him and break the vicious circle once and for all? Marija Zidar’s epic drama was filmed over 5 years in an obstinate patriarchal world, on the threshold of modern times. A mountain western from the old world, from the stuff of antique tragedies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8zN6nKqfEGeEAwPIR79BGdKTSgD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23084,"logo_path":"/9mcikqGo4XjxS5t1w97FIoYeD0C.png","name":"Vertigo","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":1653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film House Bas Celik","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":153636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seagull Entertainment","origin_country":"ME"},{"id":153637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dera Film","origin_country":"XK"},{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"},{"iso_3166_1":"ME","name":"Montenegro"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2022-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reconciliation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
