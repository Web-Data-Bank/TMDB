With his Hi-8 camera, Henricks documents two workers in his interior courtyard. The camerawork has a secretive and furtive feel, treating the male body as an erotic object. This footage forms the basis of a video which attempts to implicate the viewer in processes of exhibitionism and image fetishization. Handy Man is part of a trilogy of works exploring one of the principle metaphors of video: the window.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/moXXfzXHcXNMrFhYUlRRgM6q4N6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handy Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
