A road movie and a immersive report from a Venezuela on the verge of collapse. Inspired by Joseph Conrad’s classic novel ‘Nostromo’, we are led into a twilight world where allegiances change among the travellers under the enormous dome of the sky. Pirates and pilgrims cross tracks, and oil is traded on the black market in the middle of nowhere. Crackling car radios relay an ideological battle of words. Has the oil cast a curse on Venezuela? The country is in the midst of the worst political and humanitarian crisis that South America has experienced in the 21st century. Instead of trying to explain the chaotic situation, Pulpeiro places us in the middle of it. A sensory and cinematic film, where the oil runs like thick, black blood through the arteries of the road network and connects us with some of the people who are trying to make life work beyond law and order.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AmxgxUPk4fcifjPPhZhdhQk5E8F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2021-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Foul a Sky","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
