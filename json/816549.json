Eckersberg! – works on mastering the motifs of nature. It’s not going so well. Therefore, he embarks on an educational journey to the island of Møn, where a transformation begins. Ancient folk tales and figures borrowed freely from Norse mythology meet hypermodern high-tech in a lavishly baroque adventure. Like a spiritual relative of Matthew Barney, he lets its hybrid characters explore the historical past and possible futures at the same time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/16sapHC7ORHRyliJgIQNEZPVbri.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Picturesque Beast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
