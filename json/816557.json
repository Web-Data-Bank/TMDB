But they share a demand for democracy and freedom. They have the will and the courage to fight – and they can see that things are going in the wrong direction in the small island city, which officially has autonomy under China but is now tightening its grip and demanding that ‘troublemakers’ be put away or silenced. Amid the violent protests, we meet a 21-year-old student, a teenage couple and a new father.","popularity":0.939,"poster_path":"/l0NqrWYcSsXGALDfjN1ZVgjl7ml.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enemy Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When a City Rises","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
