To Harrington’s amazement, and in spite of her lapsed religious beliefs, she must admit that her life has been transformed by the event. And when the press gets a hold of the story what ensues is a funny and touching look at what it means to believe and to belong.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nDRVJjKEKKcBqNytOWRmjEXf0j3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blinking Madonna and Other Miracles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
