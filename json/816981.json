The animated sculptures made of pebbles present us with short stories. The soundtrack of the animation - original arrangements of melodies from Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Music Boxes\" - is performed by Gidon Kremer and the musicians of his orchestra Kremerata Baltika.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Images d'Orient","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
