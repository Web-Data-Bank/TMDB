Set in and around a Charleston, SC Baptist church, weaving through this ensemble piece are three main characters - Brea, an introspective pastor's daughter experiencing debilitating doubt, the hyperactive Laura, Brea's best friend and a devout believer, and Tim, the open-hearted son of a single father, confronting his homosexuality for the first time. Tensions and buried feelings abound, as colleges are chosen and adults behave badly, as Brea, Laura and Tim attempt to hang onto what they have, all the while yearning to break free.","popularity":4.221,"poster_path":"/5EiP1mW0yA5kovHOYDoJEWLzbRl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cone Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story of Faith, Sexuality, Love and Friendship.","title":"The Wise Kids","video":false,"vote_average":6.118,"vote_count":38}
