Since ancient times, only Evenks and reindeer herds roamed here. Civilization came here only in the middle of the twentieth century-for the first Soviet uranium, which was extracted by the Borlag prisoners, and for the copper of the unique Udokan deposit... But what brought our contemporaries-the heroes of this film-here? Who are they? What trials, sins, and memories do each of them bear? What do they (and any of us) have?) A mission?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mission","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
