The people who came to work on this steamer became a unique crew in their own way. Many of them worked as a team for a very long time - both ten and fifteen years. This was a rare case in the Sakhalin Shipping Company-with an endless staff turnover. \"Anton Buyukly\" has become for many sailors not just a place of work, but a real home. And the crew members of this ship remained loyal friends for life.","popularity":0.847,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father's Ship","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
