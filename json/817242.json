One person in the frame. A loner in black jeans and a hat. Our contemporary. A man of the beginning of the 21st century. Pausing in his run to talk to himself. And with each of us. About the main thing. About the transience of the passage of time. About the disease of the century-the consumption of everything and everything, near and far. About the loneliness that burns us. About the people who make us who we are. About music as a divine gift. A salutary, timely word to a contemporary who drinks and drinks the cup of poison of the philosophy of infinite pleasure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tree Branches","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
