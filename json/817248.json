Father Kara was showered with honours for regularly exceeding expectations. For his son Boris and his daughter Marina, though, those days are just a memory. Unemployment is now rife in the entire region and worries are drowned with vodka. Marina sets up a small private bakery, baking day and night to ensure the family survives. When debris from a Proton M rocket crash-lands on the mountain pasture, narrowly missing the cabin, Boris and Marina demand a large sum of compensation money from the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Their claims remain unanswered and instead of the much-hoped-for improvement in their lives, the family is beset by more disaster.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
