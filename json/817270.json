But as farmers are conned into buying more and more pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers that they don't need, which demand often ten times more water, the water table is sinking at an alarming rate. Punjab's water has been poisoned by the chemicals, and the farmers poison their bodies with opium, helping them to work longer and harder. Loans from a middleman are taken out, with extortionate interest rates that are impossible to pay back. As a result, hundreds of Punjabi families are left without a father, husband or son as more and more farmers cave in under the pressure and drink their own chemicals to end their lives.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/i0KOOOyt7oiTAdLuFjKgqBwG2ab.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toxification","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
