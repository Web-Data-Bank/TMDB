Then a ferry carrying fifteen boarding students sank in the Ili River. Three drowned. But twelve were saved-thanks to the young driver of the state farm Bisetai Daurenbekovâ€¦ This film is about saved children. More precisely, already adults. About how their fates turned out. Some still live on the banks of the Ili - they will tell about themselves, about others, and about Bisetai.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyssetay Daurenbekov and 12 Fates","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
