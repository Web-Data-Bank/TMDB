For a year and a half, the director of the film took part in all the demonstrations against Merkel's policies. From the author: \"I have lived in Germany for 14 years, and all this time it seemed to me that I lived in one of the most democratic countries in the world. But since September 2015, exactly from the moment when our dear Frau Merkel opened the borders and announced that Germany is ready to accept refugees from Syria, I realized that this is not the case. One of the safest countries in the world is gradually turning into the territory of madness... And there can be no other way where citizens have been taught for decades to live with a sense of guilt for the crimes of their grandfathers and great-grandfathers. So Germany is now destroying itself. To please people with an alien culture who will never become part of German society.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
