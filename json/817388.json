Given up for dead after a rousing chase, he wakes up in a hospital bed next to who but bad-guy goomba Jon. This, Alex thinks, could lead to a rather unpleasant hospital stay. Using the wits which have kept him alive thus far, he begs for help from nurse Heather Hunter, who agrees on the condition that he promises to turn state's evidence and testify against the bad guys. Sexually, things get rolling nicely in the opening Heather-Mr. Marcus pairing, and get hotter from there until Ms. Hunter's concluding coupling with Alex, which is hotter than Vesuvius' magma chamber.
