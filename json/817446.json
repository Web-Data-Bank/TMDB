We see and hear through the eyes and ears of our friends, all people, the entire human race.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We see and hear through the eyes and ears of our friends, all people, the entire human race.","title":"Talking Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
