After the closure of the mine, there were only old barracks, mountains of recycled land and unnecessary people who had lost the meaning of life. Is it possible to survive in such conditions and not sink even lower, when all moral boundaries are erased? Are these people's hopes for happiness destroyed? And is there a place for a holiday, a dream, or love in a hopeless reality? At the festival \"Texture\" in Perm, the tape was awarded the main prize.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z1NnAFs80ZcoEGKpwiUbNoF5T3o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vertov Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2010-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Day of the Coal Miner","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
