Unnecessary, superfluous, idiotic-so unflattering Andrey speaks about himself. However, all 30 years of his life could be the script of a feature film. Having escaped from a mental hospital, in which he was locked up with a lifelong diagnosis of \"incapacity\", he ended up in a large – scale madhouse-the capital. Without documents and a roof over his head, Andrey is looking for ways to regain his right to a free life. Now his route is official offices and endless psychiatric examinations. The goal is to return the legal capacity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wIvCMXyHwh8qShkZDJ2xOQRhUU0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinoteatr.Doc","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idiot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
