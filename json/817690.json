Bill Traylor was born into slavery in 1853 on a cotton plantation in rural Alabama. After the Civil War, Traylor continued to farm the land as a sharecropper until the late 1920s. Aging and alone, he moved to Montgomery and worked odd jobs in the thriving segregated black neighborhood. A decade later, in his late 80s, Traylor became homeless and started to draw and paint, both memories from plantation days and scenes of a radically changing urban culture.  He made well over a thousand drawings and paintings between 1939-1942. This colorful, strikingly modernist work eventually led him to be recognized as one of Americaâ€™s greatest self-taught artists and the subject of a Smithsonian retrospective.","popularity":0.644,"poster_path":"/dQCgdcyZKgbWBXXgjkAgxFXX9N3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
