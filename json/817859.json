From watching RFK’s funeral train pass by as a child with her father, to riding a commuter train to visit her aging mother, each stop brings a collage of memories questioning what is real, imagined or forever forgotten. Fullness and loss appear and disappear along the way, leading her to ask, What is left when memories fade or collide; when the heart sings out and the mind says no? How do we keep memories alive and how do we trust what they were to begin with? Filled with pathos and humor and directed by Padraic Lillis, Julia takes us on a journey of the heart: to discover what it is to love, lose and love again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gO7KgxewjM9B15HeuHTRcNK17x8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143811,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Playhouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was Right Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
