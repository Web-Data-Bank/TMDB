The influence of British documentary tradition - as well as the films of directors like Joris Ivens or Georges Franju - is evident in Fishermen in Jaffa. In a carefully-planned frail structure of narrative, the film progresses from daylight to night. In it Perlov creates at the same time a vast, panoramic view, and an intimate, private one - whether he films a lone cat wandering on the dock, or the glowing faces of the fishermen. This early film already depicts Perlov's unique style.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6hd0ZomWVVuzSIQdEUZq95pbg6I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fisherman In Jaffa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
