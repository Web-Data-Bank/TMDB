He was freed by the warden Angela Magdici. The lovers lived on the run for five weeks - for them \"the most beautiful time in their lives\". Then the Italian police discovered and arrested them in their hideout in northern Italy.  The escape of the duo moved Switzerland: never before had a warden escaped with an inmate. The incident not only caused a great stir throughout the country, but also prompted measures at the Zurich Office of Justice.  The \"DOK\" film provides an exclusive look behind the scenes and shows what those affected say about their story - first and foremost Angela Kiko and her husband. However, their defence lawyers, the head of the Limmattal prison from which the couple had escaped at the time, as well as the director of the correctional facility where Hassan Kiko is serving his sentence, also describe their view of this extraordinary case.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9EKZUbGeJgV2R0AGigbj6I63n9z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78507,"logo_path":"/lVtS5Z6MITcHXlKhgwbM3CNYtuu.png","name":"Peacock Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Guard and the Inmate","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
