The team of Harry, Ryan, Chris and Guido began a project that would see them learn how to paraglide, climb to the roof of Africa (Mt. Kilimanjaro) and attempt to fly from the summit of the world's tallest freestanding mountain in September 2019. Their core purpose was to fundraise $40,000 NZD ($25,000 USD) via Wings of Kilimanjaro for the Emboreet primary school in Simanjiro, Tanzania.
