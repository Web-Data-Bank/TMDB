First held in 1896 and now in its 105th edition, the race is a grueling contest over 160 miles of narrow, cobbled farm roads in the Picardie and Norde-Pas-de-Calais regions of France with a finish in the historic Roubaix velodrome. Road to Roubaix is a visual narrative of an old-school, bare-knuckle clash of the finest athletes in the world with each other and one of the world's most unforgiving sporting environments. The filmmakers tell the story of the riders, the fans, the mechanics, and the unpredictable landscape that is the setting for the Paris-Roubaix.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road to Roubaix","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
