Each February since 1992, the Mr. International Bear Contest has transpired in San Francisco, with the contestants competing against one another for the title of top bear. Former music-video director Marc Klasfeld helms the documentary Bears -- a headfirst plunge straight into the heart of this gay subculture. Klasfeld begins with a glance back at the first such competition, from 1992, then travels to the 2006 competition for a visit with several of the participants and documentary coverage of the event itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uGfeDeczkDcRjU3wqCiwHIJtQRj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bears","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
