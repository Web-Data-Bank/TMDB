The title of the work is taken from the ancient Chinese mythology classic \"Shan Hai Jing\". In addition to studying the interaction of ancient and modern Chinese culture, the \"New Mountain and Sea Classic\" and similar works have a dreamlike effect: the clearly depicted images composed of incredible narrative techniques faithfully present the illusion of the world around people. The work strongly condemns environmental degradation, social collapse, and large-scale urbanization. The connection with reality strengthens its political significance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2006-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Book of Mountains and Seas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
