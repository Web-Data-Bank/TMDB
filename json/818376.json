Changing the appearance of cities is always associated with a change in the model of social relations. Through architecture, you can trace the course of history: victories and defeats, changes in the way of life of people and their key values. This is evidenced by the cities.  Grozny, Volgograd, St. Petersburg, Pskov-absolutely not similar to each other, with different historical fate, however, the author shows in the film the common thing that unites their living space: the temple as an image of the universe. The largest mosque in Europe, Mamayev Kurgan, as a symbol of Victory in the World War, the polytheism of Imperial St. Petersburg, the heavenly city of ancient Pskov. However, any architectural project starts with a master pencil. The architect Andrey Anisimov tells about the exceptional features of these cities.","popularity":0.844,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Beginning Was… The Cube","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
