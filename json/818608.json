Here, he attempts to table a law aimed at upholding the rights of what in Quebec are known as caregivers, and shows us in passing how a law whose need seems patently obvious is put together, debated, voted on and . . . dies on the battleground of French politics. A stirring documentary about social injustice that somehow manages to make us bust a gut laughing as we rage with indignation. And also cry at the beauty of it all, thanks to the director’s humanist sensibility and a deft play between reality and fiction.","popularity":0.815,"poster_path":"/yXBqgBMWq3IbpSIrUtwq9chI7tG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115625,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les 400 clous","origin_country":""},{"id":73552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jour2Fête","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":73555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fakir","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Who Care","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":15}
