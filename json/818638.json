It was also my only experience shooting with rolls of film…What I wanted to film was my encounter with Marcel Pilate…He is the first hero of my films. The film shows the moment he came to set up the beehives I had bought from him. It was with him that, for the first time, I acted [in nature], had an occupation there. It was also the first time that I saw someone work like that: each object, each tool, each gesture, everything was done in a sort of ceremony and ritual.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Vicinal","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
