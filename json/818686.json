He filmed himself gardening – potting plants, preparing cuttings. Cat, dog, donkey, hens are moving about, playing, resting around the table, the goat is prancing on the table top, the whole menagerie is living its life, crossing the frame freely. On these images of perfect insouciance, he edited the sound of a radio news report about the Fukushima disaster. The date is March 2011: here, the garden, the end of winter and the pleasure of plunging one’s hand into the earth, touching the plants, to prepare for spring’s arrival; over there, death, sky and sea contaminated for many years, untouchable. The garden is not at odds with the disaster provided it heeds its echo, albeit unwillingly. The garden table is also the altar where domestic rituals are performed to ward off the horror.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Côté jardin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
