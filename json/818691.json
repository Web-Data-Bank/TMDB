We had decided to create an installation together [with Vincent Barré] in the greenhouse of the Seyssel d’Aix palace: a tribute to Paul Cézanne and his final model, the gardener Vallier….We spoke about the project with one of Vincent’s childhood friends, Christine Toffin, who reminded us that she was related to the painter. Her aunt, the painter’s granddaughter, still lived at Bourron-Marlotte. We decided to go and film Aline Cézanne in her retirement home at Bourron-Marlotte….It was during the sound editing that we thought of making a film using the images we had shot for the sound. The framing is minimal – it’s fine as it is, but it was not set up with a film in mind. A year later, we went back to see Aline.  Her speech had become more confused and we went off with her to the village to find the houses of her childhood.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aline Cézanne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
