Elsewhere, they dance to inaudible music with their friends, each couple keeping to a rhythm of their own. At times, this depiction of the memories we see one Dom Casmurro commit to paper with a flamboyant pen seems to be an interplay of conflicting emotions – particularly when jealousy raises its head.  Adapted from the Brazilian classic novel 'Dom Casmurro' (1899) by Machado de Assis as an ironic/philosophical essay on poetry and jealousy, and featuring fragments of Bressane’s previous works.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cTRJN5741gtMrd3WcTHg2Pfn2jQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51105,"logo_path":null,"name":"TB Produções","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Capitu and the Chapter","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
