The word flows from the tongue naming the pleasure of earthly life and judging it as beautiful, but shallow and useless; vanity is a deadly sin. A female sin. The man painted the woman, put a mirror in his hands and called it vanity. The woman in representation admires herself, but the one who really admires her body is the artist. Whose vanity? In VANITAS, we re-divide the woman in our bodies, showing the depth of what is palpable. If the Father's temple hides after death, clean and perfect, we reject them. We welcome Mother Nature in us, life-death in a perpetual sacred cycle, also honoring her dark face. You may wish to reach heaven, but it is on earth that your knees fall.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zmcKQKIIPj2bIQAiIOCS9sPxPMI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Círculo de Iniciação Teatral da Academia de Coimbra (CITAC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Vanitas vanitatum omnia vanitas","title":"Vanitas","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
