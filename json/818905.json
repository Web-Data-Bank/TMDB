No wonder: these memories are anything but pleasant. Jin was born in the 1990s, during China’s one-child policy. It was normal then for unborn girls to be aborted – right up to the last month of a pregnancy, because boys were preferred. Living babies were also ruthlessly dumped in the garbage, or in the woods. Jin survived for a week in a box on the streets.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6YksljMjycRk3fy0bigQYivFc0O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wang Qiong Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":174,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All About My Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
