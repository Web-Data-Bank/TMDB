We explore the spaces she feels the safest, from the chair of Tee Fergus’ tattoo studio, to strolling the streets of Toronto with her friends. Munera’s journey illustrates that self-discovery is an ongoing process, rather than an ultimate destination. Munera’s high-spirited personality and eclectic style easily captures attention and hearts as she expresses the importance of self-awareness through life’s unforeseeable changes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v5qTIFnmEtwDzBzMQ65tAFI63Uv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A second chance to be free","title":"With Love From Munera","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
