Phoenix literally changes colour as the characters circle one another. A medical student who sometimes rents out a room in his house receives a visit from a young woman he was romantically involved with the previous summer. But he shows little interest in her – mainly because he’s now in love with Harry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ykiF7aoLqOym9jRGH93vD2ljgzv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phoenix","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
