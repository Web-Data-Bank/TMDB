Hundred of students were disappeared. A grotesque tradition - the complete physical obliteration of students organizing for progressive change - was hurled into motion. This film is nearly wordless. In place of words, the enactment of violence against the images themselves, in a stagger towards commensurate aesthetics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Brief History of the Obliteration of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
