As liberal democracy becomes increasingly challenged in the West, we expose the dangerous tactics employed by the radical-left and far-right, alike. In a world where political polarization frames the way in which we live, a new path forward of unity is needed more than ever before. The value of the film lies in its impact, brevity and digestibility - as we confront the philosophical underpinnings of the radical left and their extreme right counterpart.","popularity":1.834,"poster_path":"/6Pegrp28iESN99FLoxVwWAIqMrF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178079,"logo_path":null,"name":"This is 42","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Better Left Unsaid (BLU) is a documentary that offers a nuanced take on political extremism.
