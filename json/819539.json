This is where the mischief started, he explains. His aunt believes it began with his parents—smoking joints was more important to them than their son. Drugs and neglect were givens in his life. But now, after years in institutions and prison, he is free.  Bruce learns, for the first time in his life, to reflect on his habits, behavior, and feelings. He visits his father and travels to his relatives abroad as he attempts to come to terms with them and himself. At the boxing school he gets to vent his frustrations—with the punching bag, and in conversation with his best friend Lamyn.  Reinventing himself isn’t always a smooth process—when he finds it difficult to answer a question, he sometimes feels like he’s going to “freak out” again. But each time, he pulls himself together. He learns to speak a new language, even with his parents. Despite their difficult relationship, he wants to take care of them in their old age.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruce","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
