They often don’t even dare to tell their families, for fear of exclusion and rejection.  The Oum El Banine association in Agadir is there to support them, under the inspiring leadership of 62-year-old feminist Mahjouba Edbouche. She takes the girls and women under her wing, providing shelter, education, and legal assistance. To try and secure them a safe home, she also seeks ways for the young mothers to mend the relationships with their parents.","popularity":0.937,"poster_path":"/8t4OgWkkSlKYFmFji7LniDMv6u5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abel Aflam","origin_country":""},{"id":26607,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sedna Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2020-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mothers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
