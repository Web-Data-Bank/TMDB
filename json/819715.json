Dirty Babette Productions is a sporadic series of cabarets produced by lesbian writer/performer Christy Cameron. The emphasis is on dyke-core reading-rants and media art, transgender performance, pseudo-sex shows, and audience dress-up. The Manifesto is performed by Christy Cameron at “Dirty Babette’s Strange Attractor” (Toronto 1997).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cmnTGXXcNTPhWO6cMUl8rxovXmw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dirty Babette Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Legionella's Manifesto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
