The ice continent is full of life and offers a biodiversity of which only about two percent are known. Much of it is under water and could determine the future of human beings. When the northern lights cover the ice landscape in summer, the animals in the Antarctic are in a paradisiacal state. Whales blow their fountains in the sky, penguins fly like small rockets into the water, seals dive for crabs under the glittering ice floes. From the bay of the Ross Sea to the ice shelf, from the huge penguin colonies to steaming volcanoes, a life in rhythm with the ice. But the consequences of climate change are slowly becoming apparent here too. While some species are dying, others are spreading. They could bring new viruses and bacteria with them, and new dangers for humans too. The structure of nature has gotten off course. How many generations will still be able to experience the magic of Antarctica?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bsUImhQUtTg1Xkdo9rn8CKFAivu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8197,"logo_path":"/viR0A6jRF6fz6zcrET7nRAlHG49.png","name":"Gebrueder Beetz Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":103181,"logo_path":"/aqicjb5pM859n0CLwrLoGnjyecb.png","name":"Greenstone TV","origin_country":"NZ"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2021-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antarctica: The Frozen Time","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
