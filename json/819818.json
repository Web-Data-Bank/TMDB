Maria still cleanses the trophies nowadays, Sepp still washes and prepares the jerseys of the players in the basement, and Rudi is still the bus driver. They are simple people who may have access to the glamourous world of the big stars, but who never wanted to adopt to the ‘modern times’ unconditionally. They have remained side characters and experience their club from a special angle: Being witnesses of the development from a people’s sport to star cult and commercialisation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k3vt8sm3G2xNpQhsJLKmKebVEQJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":8677,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGS Film","origin_country":""},{"id":117445,"logo_path":null,"name":"absolut MEDIEN","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true stars of the record champion: The groundskeeper, the bus driver, the trophy care-taker","title":"Leben Für Den FC Bayern","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
