Surrealistically set in the 1950s, the town of Eden is a place where the air is haunted with silence. Wilma has to choose whether to redeem herself in the eyes of her religiously obsessed brother James, her neurotic chain-smoking Mother, and her opprobrious Father, or escape Eden, a place where one can never feel quite clean enough.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bocVl4EETtw9AxB4yLltchxLuSO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wilma's Sacrifice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
