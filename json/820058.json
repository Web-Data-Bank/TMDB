In this moving follow-up, Lin once again follows Han, who has since founded a shelter institute where autistic children can nurture their talents in painting and music. Because of their inability to effectively communicate their emotions and thoughts, people with autism can often be treated like outsiders. To inspire empathy for them, Lin made this moving documentary that embraces the diversity that these talented individuals and their stirring works of art bring to our lives.","popularity":0.657,"poster_path":"/uWYHXswRpdYSxKWxQuDKC7TeXTS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2021-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Among Us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
