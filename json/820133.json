Inspired by elders including environmentalist and CBC Broadcaster, David Suzuki, whale researchers Alexandra Morton and Paul Spong, totem carver Wayne Alfred, and lifelong resident of the Broughton archipelago Billy Proctor, this film is anchored by Rob Stewart’s invitation to rise up and create the world we dream for ourselves.  Viewers will come to understand the importance of the personal choices we make; it becomes clear that what we do to nature, we do to ourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8ooaSZf99262hPZCAv905ki03ia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What we do to nature, we do to ourselves.","title":"To the Orcas with Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
