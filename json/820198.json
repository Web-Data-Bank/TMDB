He is quickly tied up in a bag and he first experiences a rough ride in a wheelbarrow, after which he is dumped into a bay-mound. He is next suspended in midair at the end of a rope, where he is left to dangle until he is released by his superior officers. After many such painful subjections, he is finally given a note to deliver to the landlady, which upon reading, she begets herself into such a passion that before Bloomer leaves the room, he is a sorrowful looking spectacle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Societ√† Italiana Cines","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1913-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curing A Would-Be Aviator","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
