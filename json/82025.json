In itself quite an achievement in today’s Sweden. The film is about this man getting one last chance as he unexpectedly receives a large amount of money. About his path to reconciliation with the people he thinks he let down thirty years ago. It’s a journey filled with temptation and ambivalence. But also one about an important friendship with a young hitchhiking girl.","popularity":0.766,"poster_path":"/4SoAwLPqlKwOevjMQh4YrlmchWw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2669,"logo_path":"/xuSvgLUZJyrY4IO1jBpmlqpHqyc.png","name":"Filmlance International","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":9372,"logo_path":"/yFDmBNoacfgPWutpvD242xsuKmm.png","name":"Metronome Productions","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":1929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sonet Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":440,"logo_path":"/z10otS2BrUXXlIH5zGBP5dnhTPe.png","name":"Kinoproduction","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2006-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All it Takes is a Miracle","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":4}
