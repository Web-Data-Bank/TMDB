But aside from Eddie, the only other person who seems to have any knowledge of the game is an old timer named Emmett. As his focus deepens and his desire to fix the machine turns into paranoid obsession, he seeks out the help of his sister Liv to uncover the game's secrets. Is this the greatest game ever made?
