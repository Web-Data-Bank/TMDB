In his Tempestaire (2020), Jacques Perconte digitally interprets the meteorological imagery of Jean Epstein's film Le Tempestaire (1947). After capturing images of a storm in Cap Fagnet, Normandy, Perconte translates the atmospheric vibrations of the elements and colours of nature into vibrations of digital images whose pixellized textures and deconstructed take on a pictorial dimension reminiscent of the landscape painting of Romanticism and Impressionism. Perconte's work is a generative video in which images, constantly fed by software, never repeat themselves. The duration of the video is therefore potentially unlimited.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Tempestaire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
