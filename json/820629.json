Following James Wentzy from South Dakota to New York City, the film traces his days from struggling and surviving as an artist to later becoming an AIDS video activist. In showcasing a unique individual through his involvement with the fight against AIDS and his tireless frontline reportage of the crisis, The Books of James is an intimate portrait of a neglected everyman/hero and unearths a time now forgotten.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/korGH3QKrGF3j3hM1f4CmaO517x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frameline","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Books of James: Director's Cut","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
