The hustle and the bustle of that section of the city intrigued me. I used a hectic camera, grainy newsreel film, a 75mm lens and a long matte box to create four intersecting segments…a degraded symphony of the city. Building facades, people and traffic variously interlocking and going their separate ways, across the grid of the Square.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dLlJ1IwDvDCnhfGcQGsRhydyRpi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taylor Square","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
