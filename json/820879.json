It is set in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo (the Chinese province of Manchuria) during the closing days of Word War II. Life for the Japanese colonists is tranquil, with none of the hazards and shortages occurring in the Japanese homeland. Then, on August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union, fulfilling its obligations to the Western Allies, declares war and invades. The local Kwantung Army folds up like a house of cards, leaving the Japanese colonists exposed to the invading Russians and Chinese.","popularity":0.628,"poster_path":"/iV97p0HzWdRrPUNxlYjSF09rkli.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5141,"logo_path":"/fK2QKfHdSdw42Xx4MiD7KhDufBV.png","name":"Shin-Ei Animation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiku and the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
