The film shows an emergence of the Pink Fairy. Part femme, part tomboy, part fairy, the characters come together to subvert the idea of a fixed identity. Luminescent imagery is imprinted by hand using hand-processed colour footage, optically printing Super 8 to 16mm, 16mm to 16mm, negative to positive, video to film, and repeating motifs, to explore the intricacies of the celluloid medium. Audio emotes through random manipulations in a Brion Gysin-like cut-up technique.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vFxdojO2hV6l8hzwwPDnXnijbc8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Fairy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
