In the shadow of the civil rights movement and the Troubles, the club managed to keep playing - until the team bus of Ballymena United was caught up in the violence, taken away and burned. Derry City FC was banned from playing at home and eventually went out of business.  In 1984, the city needed a saviour. Tony Oâ€™Doherty was a Northern Ireland international who had played against England at Wembley. He teamed up with another international, Terry Harkin, and two other professionals Eddie Mahon and Eamonn McLaughlin, to become the Gang of Four who challenged the status quo. They made it their goal to get senior football back in their hometown.  This film charts the emotional journey of how in 1985, after 13 years in the wilderness, football returned to the Brandywell. The club would go on to lift both silverware and the spirits of the city, unleashing a carnival of hope, pride and optimism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ooq5VEWKKGMDjYwnvHo9mKQQiXi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Different League: The Derry City Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
