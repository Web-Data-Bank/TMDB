It started surprisingly, because Malika was supposed to get together with a different young man she’d met online. But it’s all for the best, because the two students feel an instant connection. They wind up on Nemo’s sofa, sharing their most candid musings on life, death, what other people think, the pressure to be monogamous. Jérémie Picard’s Small Talk is a charming bottle film – a no-frills portrait of budding love in the time of COVID.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pMY8AWtuTkJDefCJpwQvndZCAQQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153098,"logo_path":null,"name":"Purple Skies Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Talk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
