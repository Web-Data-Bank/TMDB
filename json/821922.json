Cantonese opera star Sun Ma Si-tsang plays a country boy who looks exactly like Sun Ma and is asked by a rich girl to impersonate the star, to help her stage an opera. The self-reflexive humour generated by the absurd situation not only provides delicious parody of celebrity culture but also comments subtly on class inequality and the perils of urbanisation. Sun Ma, who also appears as himself in a stage performance, is complemented beautifully by the brilliant comedian Yee Chau-shui as his sidekick and Hung Sin Nui, another opera superstar, as the spoiled and precocious rich girl.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":153116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evergreen Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wrongly Accused Lover","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
