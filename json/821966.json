Love. Betrayal. Flight. Weaving together ancient myth and indie rock, Weightless tells the tale of two deeply devoted sisters, Procne and Philomela, separated by circumstance, who must travel across worlds and make devastating sacrifices in order to reunite, and the god who shapes and is shaped by that journey. Inspired by a tale from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Weightless is a visual concept album—the band and the cast are one and the same—blurring the line between actors and musicians, between musical theater, video art, and rock concert, and between the virtual world and a world in which we can all hold and feel one another again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pLZB2rcpwbwrZOb62NQ9eLb48f7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153134,"logo_path":null,"name":"WP Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weightless","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
