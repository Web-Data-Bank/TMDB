The village and family life, which he longed to remember throughout his life, ends with the massacre they endured in 1918. During his long road to Erivan, Armenia, he lost all his family members. Left all alone, Casim was placed into an orphanage and was forced to change his name. To remember who he was and where he came from, every morning he repeated the mantra “Navê min Casim e, Ez kurê Celîlim, Ez ji gundê Qizilquleyê Dîgorê me, Ez Kurdim, Kurdê Êzîdî me”, which translates to: “My name is Casim, I am the son of Celîl, I come from the village of Kızılkule in Digor, I am a Kurd, and I am Yezidi”. He clings to every piece of his culture he can find, reads, and saves whatever Kurdish literature or art he comes across. As the year’s pass, Casim finds himself with an impressive collection of Kurdish culture and history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iwPfuhVgHiKAjY7e3W7htEZGevR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2021-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To remember who he was and where he came from, every morning he repeated the mantra  \"My name is Casim, I am the son of Celîl, I come from the village of Kızılkule in Digor, I am a Kurd, and I am Yezidi\"","title":"Jiyana Rewsenbireki Kurd: Casimê Celîl","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
