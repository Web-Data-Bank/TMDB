With amazing access, the film reveals Rocky’s experience with the inequities of the Swedish judicial system and the dangers of stardom and scapegoating through a series of twists and turns, ultimately paralleling the need for prison reform in our own backyard. Directed by The Architects, the film blends archival footage with contemporary interviews, animation, and electrifying live concert footage to tell the astonishing story of how one of rap’s biggest superstars became embroiled in an international incident, leading to an unexpected political awakening.","popularity":1.236,"poster_path":"/x2qFQ2MtVG3dND8Gjy7buK4A6b0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stockholm Syndrome","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
