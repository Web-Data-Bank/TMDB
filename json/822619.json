Toritaro and Sachiko live modestly. Every year, when \"that day\" comes, the two, who do not have a grave, throw a handmade lantern with the girl Chitose into a nearby river to commemorate the dead.

It grew bigger and bigger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qYUlrL8ne8akZ4pc1V526EuP68.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karagara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
