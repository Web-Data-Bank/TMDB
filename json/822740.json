It must be said that Cyrano's prominent nasal appendage attracts him constant mockery, which often forces him to defend his honor with weapons. When Roxane reveals to him that she loves the handsome Christian, a cadet of Gascony like Cyrano, the latter undertakes to take him under his protection. But the young man is cruelly lacking in spirit. It is therefore Cyrano who writes love letters to Roxane in her name, in which he expresses the ardent flame he also feels for his cousin. He even helps Christian to marry his beloved in secret. It is only years later and after having been the victim of an attack that Cyrano, on the verge of death, will finally declare his passion for her.","popularity":0.996,"poster_path":"/uVq5nAqFs849RRJsOZZoWJAlnvO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cerito Films","origin_country":""},{"id":106517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Annabel Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cyrano de Bergerac","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
