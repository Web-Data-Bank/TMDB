We watch romantic, artistic and social adventures and misadventures of a generations profoundly inept against another that simply gave up on being. A comedy about the fear of rejection with double edged swords and the tale of the knight of underachievement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p5ixaVsSl7MNGgSMi3RmYnDwYAf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caos Calmo Filmes","origin_country":""},{"id":153275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palco 13","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Protagonista","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
