Navigating through a multitude of spaces from the natural world to man-made environments as well as virtual planes, traditional relationships between the creator, the tool, and the subject are questioned, shattered and reconstructed. Reflecting on my own practice as a filmmaker working in non-fiction, the film takes a collage-like approach to examining issues around representation, verisimilitude, the ethnographic image, and the limitations of the form itself. Shot on seven different cameras (and a video synthesizer) on both film and video over the course of a decade in Sri Lanka, China, and the United States, I delve into some of my fundamental curiosities as a filmmaker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eWKmrRlrzpzdByrfiVZFKsLOPAd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","name":"Sri Lanka"}],"release_date":"2021-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Show Me Other Places","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
