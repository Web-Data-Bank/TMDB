Here in Australia real estate is very strong, and ‘brick and tile’ is what we call a solid house. In this film I experimented with optical printing for the first time [i.e. re-combining images after shooting, rather than in-camera]... pretty much purely for my own aesthetic pleasure. I showed the film at a documentary festival in Germany but the audience were less than impressed when I explained that the film would hopefully assist potential home builders to select their desired brick and tile combination.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ist0ycqxZ7W2aXTsQyoXUTYs0Yd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brick and Tile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
