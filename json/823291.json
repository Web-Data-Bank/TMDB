When a pious young nun pleads for the life of her condemned brother, Angelo’s response reveals a web of desire, deception and hypocrisy that infects every corner of society. Robert Falls’ daring production takes us into the heart of Shakespeare’s dark comedy, in which virtue and vice collide—and lust and the law are inextricably entwined.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A2k9aQeoHNcKVVad5VfxF4j330q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131995,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goodman Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Measure for Measure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
