Recently, there has been a rise in the restoration and preservation of these forgotten sites by those who have a personal connection with the deceased or an appreciation of their historical significance.  But there is much work to be done in order to preserve this part of Americaâ€™s history. Unmarked not only explores these untold stories of the past but also the efforts underway to preserve them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A8TuW9udK27qmqPtA8G3DR1DGwl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If we don't save our past, we'll lose it","title":"Unmarked","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
