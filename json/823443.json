In a town of only 3,000 people, coffee shops are limited, and most folks meet to chat and enjoy their morning brew in the middle of a busy drive-through restaurant. One of those locals is Philip Snider. Philip and his wife, Roberta, were longtime Hartville residents, until his wifes sudden disappearance. Rumors swell that Philip had something to do with it, but no one knows for sure. One day, a new resident of the town, Missy, walks into the restaurant, and things are never the same. She strikes up an unusual friendship with Philip, and the town holds its breath from afar. What starts out as a meet-cute then swirls into a cycle of surprising and sinister twists that viewers wont see coming.","popularity":0.696,"poster_path":"/9fXS4KjHlGZ5BkXGvIj3GlwekR0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Philip Met Missy","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
