Together for years, Angela longs for Paul to pop the question but Paul doesn't believe in marriage. Angela persuades herself he doesn't believe in them and leaves him. In his drunken quest for solace, Paul begins a journey of self-discovery - with a little help from two talking mannequins and a relationship-counselling panda - to try to overcome his fear of commitment. Question is: will it be in time? Shot on 35mm anamorphic on location in Swansea and the Gower Peninsula in the spring of 2007 by Welsh director Hefin Rees and producer Ben Pickering, BEACHED screened at the Cannes Short Film Corner and the Strasbourg International Film Festival in 2009. It features the final screen appearance of the late Welsh rugby legend Ray Gravell.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9bKMs6E0Q4UHbj8qGYyhXASJ0XG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Impasse Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-06-05","revenue":41703,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A quirky and at times surreal tale of love and commitment in the 21st Century.","title":"Beached","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
