His reporter contact is missing and nobody's looking for him; his first assignment is to meet with priest Pupo, so fevered with the advent of Satan that he clobbers an altar boy he fears is possessed; but there's also love, in the form of nurse Arloa Reston but who is she meeting in the jungle? Cosmic discussions of good and evil, with Pupo and a nihilistic colleague, turn into a battle for survival with the still-lurking forces of repression.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u0rddlsaEUUVbDqoFBa6jYDq4mO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible Evidence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
