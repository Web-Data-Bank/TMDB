Bruno can never have children .He says nothing about this diagnosis to Anne, his beloved wife. Nor does he tell her about a large debt he has taken out. It is as if Bruno were a man without any qualities or talents. A mediocre man who has lost all pride. Though now everything appears hazy in his memory. Like a river that flows peacefully, showing no signs of the hidden currents at work below. But at times those currents can return to the surface. Without warning.","popularity":1.525,"poster_path":"/q6kPPNSzzBwTkv7vRccCOBSO6QK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7705,"logo_path":"/kFwgAgSN5bvyzfq6RXt4OkXLQ31.png","name":"ITC Movie","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":27559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bianca Film","origin_country":""},{"id":10358,"logo_path":"/pvgiWovEFHYoOO49V7arAhitWTM.png","name":"Ventura Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":11228,"logo_path":"/tLdn4pStInhdPQxNyxHFuQQLT50.png","name":"RTI - Reti Televisive Italiane","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2008-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fallen Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":9}
