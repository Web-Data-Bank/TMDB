Following their leader’s promise of a better life, the tribe take their chances and embark on a perilous quest across unknown and treacherous terrains. But when they suspect a malevolent, potentially mystical, being is hunting them down, the terrified clan are forced to confront a danger they never envisaged. Shot in an isolation bubble in the Scottish Highlands during the pandemic, Andrew Cumming’s visionary survival horror is a masterclass in expansive world-building that belies its humble origins. With committed performances from its cast, who speak in a fictional prehistoric language (don’t worry, there are subtitles), this is genre filmmaking at its most breathtakingly ambitious. And it’s bloody scary too.","popularity":0.828,"poster_path":"/cqTbNZHY7jIFpkiY4SASa4Zweug.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Escape Plan Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16877,"logo_path":"/pR2SnHFl7BvRIUuauFJrxXFYjeU.png","name":"BFI Film Fund","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8087,"logo_path":"/54EcBNvIolJDr4OHFACvTHJK2Q0.png","name":"Creative Scotland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":113219,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freeway CAM B.V.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Origin","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
