The angle of inclination of the Earth in this last movement also marks the climatic seasons. From the need for greater accuracy in measuring time, gnomons and solar quadrants arose, for whose reading the duodecimal numbering is used. Based on this numbering, time zones and mechanical measuring devices were established, illustrated by the clock mechanism with a church bell. The evolution of astronomy determines the creation of more accurate electronic devices for the evaluation of time, such as the meridian telescope, the Markowitz chamber, the electronic oscillators and the telescope, with which astronomers work at the National Observatory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yiYguPL8Avs0kgQEf6y66d9fg5K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100338,"logo_path":null,"name":"INCE - Instituto Nacional de Cinema Educativo","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1958-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Medida do Tempo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
