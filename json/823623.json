Paradoxically, the most severe ordeal in the last 20 years has brought people together, while dividing them. Loneliness became a catalyst for internal changes for the six Russian-speaking characters of the film from different countries. Distanced from the usual life, for a month they filmed video diaries and learned to interact with the world in the new conditions of strict restrictions. Everything that is shown on the screen is pure improvisation, non-stop life, sincere feelings without censorship. The truthfulness of what is happening is emphasized by one of the most innovative technological formats — screenlife.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rVR0URgvRar5h9HYydTz1m1JkCp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170204,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At a Distance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
