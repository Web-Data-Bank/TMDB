Through her own innocence, Ruth withstands their advances, but she falls victim to the dashing Jefferson Kane, who suggests that she visit him at his home. Suspicious, Sylvia follows her daughter to Jefferson's estate, where she finds Ruth struggling with the villain, and after denouncing him, Sylvia takes the girl home. Sylvia lovingly embraces Ruth, and as she is discussing the shallowness of society life, Richard and Bobby Woodward, Ruth's old sweetheart, arrive demanding Ruth's return. Eventually, however, Sylvia regains Richard's love, and Ruth is united with Bobby.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tinsel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
