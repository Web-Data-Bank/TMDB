One way to think about the film is of a camera gathering small fragments of time from a forest that exists in larger periods of time, and stretching these moments into something more appropriate to what the trees would experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qhlPPVKo0yRnNMuVcx5gMfE69Gu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Is Something Invisible","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
