Ichibei, who plays Tomisaburo Wakayama, is in a series of pinches, such as being seriously injured to the spear and being caught by the Oniwaban and tortured. The action scene in the snow, which reversely utilizes the fact that it was snowing in Kyoto at the time of shooting, is also very powerful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mj3UiM6BwKHmCOItEQqzTGIfV01.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1983-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gokinzo Yaburi Ieyasu no Kubi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
