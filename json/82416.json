Several events convinced Marion that God was leading her to a cure for Craig and that the get-well cards he was receiving had the power to keep him alive, so she launched a worldwide campaign to break the Guinness record for receiving the most get-well cards. At the time, the world record seemed an impossible 1,000,265, but Craig received over 350 million cards from all over the world. Against the advice of her doctors, Marion followed one of those cards to America for Craig's miraculous cure.","popularity":2.586,"poster_path":"/tW7lbnT1cUu4ygeZ8Z6ywn10NHa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12077,"logo_path":"/s6p5INYKlo6gD6RFXlm9ACA2VVj.png","name":"Viacom Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4369,"logo_path":"/9IOys9AslGUqSDk7SJhWkdEgTlX.png","name":"Legacy Filmworks","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can the whole world's prayers work a miracle?","title":"The Miracle of the Cards","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":10}
