We are all haunted by temporal distortion, perhaps no more than when we attempt to remember what the future looked like to our younger selves. As the mist of time devours our memories, the future recedes; each of us burdened by the gaping mouth of entropy. Yet, emerging technology provides a glimmer of hope; transhumanism promises a future free from mortality, disease and pain. Does our salvation lie in digital simulacra? We're here to sell you the answer to that question, for the low, low price of four hundred and seventy seconds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a5DE4owZPRePeBQVCygRzmwPtvM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Selling images of a future free from mortality.","title":"welcome_home.exe","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
