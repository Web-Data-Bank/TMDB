With his party-animal sister Alyssa, and her latest boyfriend Dante, he retreats to a rural outback where he obsessively pursues the unorthodox research that led his colleagues to shun him. Here, he makes a mind-blowing discovery that may rescue his career. Trapped in isolation, four flawed characters grapple with their awesome responsibilities and the delusional idea that we humans are the master species.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tcs2AtgToNxBo1kRBPBArYcmqvV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shopfloor Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Leave me alone.","title":"2.0 Lucy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
