The film shows the arduous and surreal labor of adults and teenagers extracting coltan, tungsten and black tourmaline. Our camera captures their repeated movements, their picks, their sweat, fatigue, their faces tense by the effort, their breathing. Their tirelessly repeated gestures compose a kind of bitter-sweet symphony. We enter makeshift tunnels and follow the men who have to arch their backs to advance to the deposits. Our camera is in no hurry to allow the spectators to live and feel this difficult work. The light falls and the workers leave the mining site little by little towards the evening refreshments, before returning to the same routine at dawn.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j6k20PoHkOnyB828L00hJql3CSo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Diggers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
