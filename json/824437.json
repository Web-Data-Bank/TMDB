History, place, time...and how we feel compelled to endlessly photograph one another. We’re all in a way little ham actors...a wave, a smile, doing a little dance...performing for the camera in front of landscapes and monuments. I worked with some old 16mm home-movie footage I’d been given, shot in the Blue Mountains [a favourite tourist destination and wilderness area close to Sydney]. Through optical printing and camerawork in the field I managed to combine the feel of then and now. [...] I used a prism in front of the lens, which chased the images (including some of me, photographing) ‘round and ‘round...mirroring the way history endlessly repeats itself.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rCjX2qgXngpthJx1lgpbj5afPAM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
