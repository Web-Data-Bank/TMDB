I’d always been intrigued by the intricate natural and artificial shapes of the city’s Eastern harbour (eg the Woolloomooloo Finger Wharf and Pyrmont) and its ocean headlands and beaches. I cut out shapes from the Gregory’s Street Directory as mattes, and different filters to heighten and highlight Sydney’s extraordinary beauty. I used a hacksaw blade on the edge of a cymbal as a soundtrack...a kind of metallic sound to connect with the watery surfaces...I literally composed the film as it was running in the projector.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2vAmdKRCLPD4Zh6SrPq7EAoUb36.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elevated Shores","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
