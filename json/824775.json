He personifies the nihilistic philosophy of Albert Marcuse and tries to manipulate her. Her dependence on him forces her to reassess all the values of her art and life. We observe these events at three levels; a woman writer uses them as the basis of a play and in the process reveals parallels in her own experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1253,"logo_path":"/6f0A0AqIPHYheRb90tVMutuzSnP.png","name":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Marcuse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
