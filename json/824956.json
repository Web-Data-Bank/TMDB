I was motivated mostly by a longing for decent coffee. I wanted to become healthy after eating an unhealthy but fabulous tasting meal. I succeeded in walking over 100 blocks to Tims, taking the back roads, all on foot, with no Segways or bicycles used. Hourly, I put stretches of pot-holes behind me. I saw many beautiful landscapes, met friendly people, socialist workers, and here and there the occasional milksop whiner. I got along well with all of them, and had good conversations. I must say that people in this city are generally pretty strange.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking from Sals to Tims","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
