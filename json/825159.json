A 1998 vision of \"Minets Sauvages\".  It's hard to live in a hot city when you love boys!  His older, bisexual brother is an enemy, his parents a threat; neighbours, stairs, cellars, car parks, a daily trap where the law of nature rules.  Difficulties to assume his difference, rapes, dominations, and sometimes tenderness are a part of life. Regularly harassed, he runs away and takes refuge with a lover who cynically makes use of his distress and demands a \"right of entry\".  He doesn't stay for long. Rodolphe gets in the way and is thrown out. Back at his parents' many conflicts await him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d3UFHv67xTZwxg8z6iQbyk6epCj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65668,"logo_path":"/qHpNaCy2IGoTdyQkI2eD972E7Va.png","name":"French Art","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":65669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cadinot","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emergency Exit","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
