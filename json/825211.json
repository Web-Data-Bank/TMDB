By video recycling trash shots into video art using the latest algorithm technology, visual art may help to understand our limited resources on earth and how to use them in a respectful manner. Every day we produce millions of clips sharing them on social media without even noticing anymore how much pixel garbage we create. At the same time, we produce every day millions of tons of plastic waste, polluting our environment without even noticing it anymore. SPEED wants to be a symbol of change as we are running out of time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/62KblL5WZGm9JLiae9TXT1iyd96.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artoldo Pictures","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speed","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
