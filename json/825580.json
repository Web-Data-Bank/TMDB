A group of lumberjacks working on a job come across the body of a man suspended in the air by a rope system, as if it were a sort of disarticulated puppet. In charge of the investigation, Justine Verard is forced to collaborate with Mehdi Djaoud, whom she holds responsible for the death of her husband, himself a detective, during a mission that went wrong five years earlier. Despite this tragic past, the two agents will have to join forces to solve this first murder together in the face of a mystery that will get thicker as the investigation proceeds. Between a complicated personal life and her investigation, Justine will be caught in a vice-like grip until the final countdown under high tension.","popularity":0.79,"poster_path":"/lnthT01fnEMZWazyg1wJGJe9ofL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Bois maudits","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5}
