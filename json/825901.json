I owe my courage to the restless adolescence that compels me to tear away any existing rules which block the way to our inner reality. Imbalance is an experience naked to us, an experience that might not be popular among Chinese college student today. It restricts us, transforms us, and forces us to expand and to change. It is the formula of a chain of events, the decease of adolescence, the edge of personal relationship, and the intermedium between bliss and despair.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e5Tu3j3hShNEg8bniyvFHx1jycK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imbalance 257","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
