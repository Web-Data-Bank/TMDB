It follows a result close to phasing, the technique developed by Steve Reich. Reich used tape recorders to repeat the same portion of sound with a time lag between the two parts, the classic cannon technique. In the canon, different voices interpret the same melodic line, but in a different way: this shift produces a superposition of melodies, that is to say, a counterpoint. Counterpoint is a discipline of musical writing whose object is the organized superposition of distinct melodic lines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Libertine X 6","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
