This depressed white soldier profits monetarily by the continuation of the war, and therefore ensures the battle endures through his power over the water and news. Inadvertently, he causes all the soldiers on both sides to perish, and thus the war ends. He then, through his media control, presents himself as the hero of the conflict and the savior of the United States.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l1qwWMc7lJF8rvxdRDiv6802djB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War Game","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
