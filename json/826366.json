Against overwhelming odds, she became the driving force behind Social Security, the 40-hour work week, the eight-hour day, minimum wage and unemployment compensation. Summoned: Frances Perkins and the General Welfare features compelling interviews with David Brooks, Nancy Pelosi, Amy Klobuchar, Lawrence O’Donnell and others while telling Perkin’s heroic story which explores the history of women in politics, Social Security, our attitudes toward immigration, poverty, Socialism, and the role of government. Without this context our current dialogue is ill-informed and diminished.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/azrtfoMIWdC3eOTMCms7ebMLXGJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summoned: Frances Perkins and the General Welfare","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
