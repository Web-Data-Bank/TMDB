And wouldn’t you just know it, Hippolyte is the son of Phèdre's husband Thésée.  Rameau tells his story with an expressive force that earned him the reputation of a revolutionary at the premiere in 1733. The richness of his harmonies, rhythms and melodies spans an entire cosmos from the underworld to the heavens, which stage director Lorenzo Fioroni, together with baroque specialist Bernhard Forck, captures in spectacular images fusing music, text, film and dance into a new unity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gijhZ6ah4I0UdEKmILXaluLEz8N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hippolyte et Aricie - Rameau","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
