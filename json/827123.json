Despite the many high-pitched arguments, Sonya takes the time to show affection and love to her boys, always ready to listen to Sean's recommended technology upgrades and Luke's school woes. A coming-of-age story that takes the time to connect to place, identity and tradition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6kj17N1wOfUpRbLQsdQmgTQDlUH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dropstones","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
