Former college friends Raylene, Nina and Helly reconnect at now-famous movie star Helly`s book-signing. As they reminisce over lunch, the three ladies discover they`ve all been dumped by cheating husbands in favor of young, hot bimbos. While passive doormat Nina keeps her faith that husband Jay will return, Raylene and Helly decide to even the score with cheating exes Mark and Evan. A fun, sexy tale that explores the powerful fantasy of older/young sex.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cpEm5tKvO0ktRYnOU5g3D4yZrip.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sweet Sinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wives Club","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
