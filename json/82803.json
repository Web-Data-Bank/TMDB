Seriously, who?  Because we’re looking for those people.  We’re looking for the people who think shouting is annoying, counterproductive, and terrible for your throat; who feel that the loudest voices shouldn’t be the only ones that get heard; and who believe that the only time it’s appropriate to draw a Hitler mustache on someone is when that person is actually Hitler. Or Charlie Chaplin in certain roles.","popularity":1.538,"poster_path":"/7KEDcaF4WVYkpCdXMfsgEDrTBfM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Busboy Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":6}
