Hu Jie filmed a mobile theater troupe's performance and as well their backstage drama. This is a Henan opera troupe; they perform in rural areas of Henan and Shandong. They contact village officials in advance, negotiate a price, and then come to perform. Such performances are welcomed by the villagers. The troupe is a closed small society. There is a strict hierarchical system inside: The protagonist of the troupe is usually invited from the state-run troupe to support the scene. These people eat delicious and spicy food, and the boss treats them indifferently. But child actors are like child labor in the troupe. Children are called apprentices, but are actually exploited and used like slaves. Children slowly grow into actors, and then find a partner in the troupe and get married. Women similarly are not treated well — they shine on the stage, but off-stage they're abused.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theater Troupe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
