While there is no official information to be found about this DVD, the elaborate menu graphics and wildly varied original sound design point to this DVD as potentially a form of portfolio, allowing the artist to showcase their early work alongside original digital manipulations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pL7gSrGOYoT6ayAN82LklNTnEp4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belly's","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
