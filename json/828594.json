Are we really as mean, parochial and up for a fight as the movies often make us out to be? Sanjeev examines which Scottish stereotypes have a whiff of truth and which ones should be fed to the Loch Ness Monster. Packed with great film clips from both famous classics and lesser-known cult gems, the programme features contributions from an impressive supporting cast list, including actors Kate Dickie, Clare Grogan, Gary Lewis, Denis Lawson, Alex Norton and Tam Dean Burn.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wha's Like Us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
