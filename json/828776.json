The film explores just that: what it means to talk about love, to find love in unexpected places and to let love change you in ways you would never predict it could. The film follows three people as they search for answers about themselves, the world around them and each other. It's a portrait of self-knowledge, love and independence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Don't You Dance?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
