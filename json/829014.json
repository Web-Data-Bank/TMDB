Then the 8mm camera increased participation in the very events it recorded, drawing out the facts of who we are or play at being. In this film, Americans – across stages of life, across decades, in backyards, at a graduation picnic, on a beach and in other ordinary places – reveal silly, happy, intense and sad things about themselves, mostly with exuberance and dignity. The film is arranged without internal editing of the found sequences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People Near Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
