Self-described as the toughest film he ever made, Excalibur told the tale of King Arthur and the Sword in the Stone and helped start the careers of actors Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, Helen Mirren and Patrick Stewart. In this one hour film, they join other cast and crew to share their memories from the filming of this Arthurian masterpiece. Documentary originally released in 2013 with the title Behind The Sword In The Stone; a later, renamed version with updated biographical information on the actors involved was then released in 2016. The 2016 version has since been shown on various on-demand channels.","popularity":0.943,"poster_path":"/60SnW3wjXEW3f7mR8TNkM1ofBtD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mossy Hare Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2013-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Excalibur: Behind the Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
