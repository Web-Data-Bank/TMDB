Meanwhile, the rich man's daughter who had just gotten married was the biological child of the wild girl's mother, who was a prostitute. The two were exchanged when their newborns were in the hospital.  This melodrama is the first film in the Malaysia-Indonesia joint venture 'Bayi' Trilogy, before BAYI TABUNG (1988) and DIA BUKAN BAYIKU (1988).  It is the first film under a special project, FILEM USAHASAMA MALAYSIA-INDONESIA initiative of FINAS (Malaysia) and P. T. Perfin (Indonesia) which started in the mid-1980s to the early 1990s-an effort that has produced a number of films of various genres. This project was born out of the failure of the Film Exchange Scheme project between FINAS and P. T. Perfin to screen Malaysian films in Indonesia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qg4f5Sia1G7Na09Zpj25tZ8Jroa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gadis Hitam Putih","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
