Like everything else about the man, he did things his own way - when he was damn good and ready. Maybe it had something to do with that other Texas singer, that Red-Headed Stranger who shook things up in Austin and country music in general. Waylon wasn't sure what the fuss was all about (as he sang, It don t matter who is in Austin, Bob Wills is STILL the King! ). This special package contains both a CD and DVD of Waylon Jenning s FIRST Austin City Limit s performance, recorded in August 1984.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lewhsihnFOmF7lWo23D81ypUGtk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36238,"logo_path":null,"name":"KLRU Austin","origin_country":""},{"id":28894,"logo_path":null,"name":"KLRU-TV","origin_country":""},{"id":28897,"logo_path":null,"name":"New West Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waylon Jennings: Live from Austin, TX '84","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
