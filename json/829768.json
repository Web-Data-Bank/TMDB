Campbell shot 70,000 feet of film, but only a fraction of his material was edited into the lecture presentation that preceded Fossey's Gorillas in the Mist. This program compiles highlights from the previously unreleased footage, offering an unforgettable glimpse into the gorilla community and Fossey's relationship with it. Her methods may not entirely jibe with those of modern conservationists, but there is no denying the profound impact of her work on current research and eco-activism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/anmuZFvrkW3VSyN1jUgB090L6z5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Twenty five years after her brutal murder in Rwanda, she is still a conservation icon.","title":"The Lost Film of Dian Fossey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
