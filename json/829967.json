But the optimistic Bong-tshio always just laughed it off. Until one day, she got lost and wandered into a police station, and then accidentally won the top prize of the lottery. Her children began to look for her desperately, rushing back to their old place in the countryside, and kicked off a ridiculous competition of filial piety.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sOFa4tKqrdrRRNBHGfNJobQFFL0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2016-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laugh for 24 Hours","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
