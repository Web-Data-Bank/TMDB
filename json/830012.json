But nothing back home could have prepared this pretty young songwriter for the sordid adventure she would find in Hollywood. Nestor Lewis is the record industry's most prominent producer (and the biggest dick). But nothing in his career could have prepared HIM for Mikki Finn! Mikki has written a song for recording star Ecstasy, rock's hottest nympho. Lewis steals Mikki's song and plans to use it on Ecstasy's next album.
