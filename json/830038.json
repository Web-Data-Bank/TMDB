Preparing for a touring exhibition to premiere in Washington DC, he now heads back on an expedition to complete his vision. But much has changed since he first went North. Shrinking sea ice is opening the door to a world hungry for its resources. Remoteness can no longer protect this land or its people from the coming impacts. For 9 weeks and 25,000 kilometres, Cory immerses himself into the Arctic. Explores with Inuit elders. Paddles the most northerly canoe route in North America. Walks in the footsteps of early explorers John Rae and John Franklin. Voyages through the Northwest Passage. And deeply connects with a changing land, to bring it to the eyes of those who may never see it. With the future of the North at a crossroads, can a simple stick and some bristle paint the Arctic into the hearts and minds of others, so far away?","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/q8KbsrNExGasaBlb1c2hfEmzKMO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Campside Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into the Artic: Awakening","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
