Drawing on Moravian folklore, Janáček faithfully and deeply conveyed the drama of a peasant girl. The composer followed the path of Mussorgsky, revealing the spiritual life of people through the recreation of intonations of living speech. The libretto is based on a drama written in a naturalistic manner. Free from naturalism, Janáček's music has powerful emotional strength and psychological truth. It was written during a difficult period in the composer's life (illness and death of his daughter).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g0JVJD8LAInoOEz6L1d3VJ1XkSH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Leos Janáček's Jenůfa performed at the Teatro Real, Madrid","title":"Janacek: Jenufa","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
