The free entry and exit of time and space is close to the expression style of the stream of consciousness, and he expresses his life background, social movement, literary philosophy and growth background concisely and neatly. Of course, the technique of screen transition and fade-in is also extremely smooth and vivid. There is a sense of reality of video reporting, and the revolutionary character of social movement in pursuit of truth is also hidden in the editing features.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/38SC3f6PZzfIGxSfJ8A2ubTEMCP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154424,"logo_path":null,"name":"He Chunmu Culture and Education Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes from Taiwanese Writers: Lin Shuangbu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
