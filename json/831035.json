Is it merely a word? A name of a person denotes his/her external identity. It is related to each and every social action and reaction of a person with other persons. The film deals with the plight of the protagonist whose name has changed overnight. The problem aggravates when the changed name connotes religious and cultural differences when Shymal (a Hindu name) or Salim (a Muslim name), the protagonist becomes Salim or Shyamal. The film brings into focus the crisis in his life and the pain of being ostracized and alienated by everyone that matters to him. In such a situation of loneliness, Shyamal identifies with his next-door neighbor who has also been alienated and is fighting his lonely existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lvpLcoVe597otSLgEBsPfAYc3mO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154476,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tara Muzik","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2006-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You May Not Believe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
