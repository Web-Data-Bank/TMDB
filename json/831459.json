He is revered by animation creators across the globe, most notably Japanese masters Osamu Tezuka, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. Forty years ago, Norshteyn began work on an ambitious adaptation of Nikolai Gogol’s The Overcoat, but after completing 25 minutes of the film, the project stalled and has been shelved for many years. A crew visits Norshteyn’s studio and finds there mountains of sketches, character studies and a shooting table covered with dust. Norshteyn himself talks about its current status and the anguish and passion that has gone into its creation.","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/mz8P2ZjNx4mjzbzssDT2EqF1Cy5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laputa Art Animation School (JP)","origin_country":""},{"id":108204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fusion Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yuriy Norshteyn: Making the Overcoat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
