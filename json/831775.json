Its usually vibrant and lasting colours quickly fade, and it suddenly withers and crumbles. Five envoys, from five diverse lands, are dispatched to find out what has happened. The envoys travel to a distant land, quietly guided by tiny spirits. Each envoy has its own strengths and vulnerabilities. They compete and support each other as they draw closer to their destination, facing treacherous terrain and difficult conditions. Through athletic challenges and the uniting power of sport, they discover the positive fundamental values that come with playful competition. Together, the envoys approach near the source of the message leaf. Can they restore life to a future in peril?","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/aED1Nyd82Flo74CaxKi59YONOqq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84493,"logo_path":"/c0NLXe9hd1lZdMYHDcx0qEZRw5k.png","name":"STUDIO PONOC","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":157385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A letter from tomorrow, in your hands","title":"Tomorrow's Leaves","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
