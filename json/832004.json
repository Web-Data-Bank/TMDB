However one door in her flat remains closed at all times. Behind that door lives her 21 years old son, Timo. Three years ago he decided to separate himself from the outside world. The only thing left for Brigitte is to wait. To wait for the next Whatsapp message. To wait for a court order that could be an inducement for change. She is waiting for the day the door will finally be opened. Whether that would be for better or for worse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bLeVbhW4Js0F3T0NKMA6LeTxN8P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76073,"logo_path":null,"name":"HFF München","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comfort Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
