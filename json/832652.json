The story begins and we move underground to meet the two protagonists: a pangolin couple. The two lovers are living a tranquil life in their hidden city beneath, when their quiet is upset by sudden earth shakes provoked by the drilling of a construction site above. Separated by the cracks in the soil, they begin an adventurous journey to find each other, taking the viewer deeper into the causes of the loss of connection between humans and the earth beneath and ultimately, of the pandemic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aPVQvKlVWSfClwjywKkTCl6R28S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scratch First Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Card","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
