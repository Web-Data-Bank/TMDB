It’s the fun of watching while they open one of Andy’s time-capsule boxes at the Warhol Museum. It’s shopping along East Ohio Street. It’s finding out why kids like to go to the Old Post Office building. And it’s marveling at the cosmic impact that stars and telescopes have had on this part of town.
