This program takes a look at several of the most interesting diners in Pennsylvania, and also considers a few other roadside restaurants (like Midway Plaza on the Pennsylvania Turnpike) that have interesting histories and reputations for good “home-cooked” food. So get a cup of coffee. Have a seat. And come along as we visit great little restaurants from Wellsboro to Downingtown, from Milford to Conneaut Lake. Let’s go to Potato City, to the Melrose in Philly and to unforgettable little places from Pittsburgh to Poconos. Whether it’s the middle of the night in State College or lunchtime in Smethport, this documentary gives you an unusual taste of Pennsylvania and some of its quirkier cuisine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vxK5ADVLaU09SkSXkKP4eIGJkuA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pennsylvania Diners and Other Roadside Restaurants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":1}
