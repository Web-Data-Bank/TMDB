Caesar, Attila and Napoleon were some of its owners. With the death of its last owner, the mad monk Rasputin, nobody knows where is it. The last clue is in Russia. Since then, governments and individuals have sought in vain, with no reliable clues that lead to it. The situation changes when in a Spanish prison, the prisoner Jacinto is identified by the Russian mafia as a carrier of a genetic abnormality associated with the dagger. His cellmates, Paper and Spider, will accompany him on a crazy adventure full of leaks and persecutions that lead them in search of treasure, to the deep heart of Russia.","popularity":1.659,"poster_path":"/lXYkZX0ONLTLhB8MTzdRVUmCGVd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enrique Cerezo","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":1182,"logo_path":"/bkgwJWvqqLuzsXV2Qv3Mg3wfcNZ.png","name":"Telecinco Cinema","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La daga de Rasputín","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":18}
