Tired of not getting better, she decides to self-prescribe an unconventional therapy: together with her dad and her teenage daughter, she travels to a house her family owns in a small volcanic island.  During this time of coexistence, each of them tries to protect their own privacy, and to safeguard their secrets. But all this secrecy triggers Fabiola’s paranoia.
