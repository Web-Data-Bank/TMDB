The Shasei-cho was copied by various other artists and became a fundamental reference for how Japanese perceive and record the natural world. 蝶 Butterfly was created by photographing actual butterflies in super-slow motion with reference to the composition and drawing style of the Shasei-cho. Each movement is a reflection of the butterfly's behavior, characteristics and personality at the time. This work is a modern-day Shasei-cho that I observed and recorded based on the techniques of the great painters of the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4ieaLJUVfaeMuXOqyZU5n8fmIPL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
