It is also a feeling of trust, being within your family. This feeling is transferred from generation to generation. This film follows a little boy losing his home through mourning and relocation, and questions if it is possible to recapture the feeling in another place. A central theme in the film is the nature of connections between generations. Differences, similarities, and behaviour patterns that are transferred between the old and the new worlds. They tie together individuals and generations in a family the same way as fine silk threads interlace within the cloth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rovfJvZHdHZSReIOSMe5U8siwux.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2021-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
