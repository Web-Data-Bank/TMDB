Moved and broken by the situation in our country, we, a group of students from the Animation Department of Lodz Film School have decided to act. We strongly oppose the recent events in our country and itâ€™s shameful that such a ruling has been pushed through during this extremely difficult time of pandemic. The Constitutional court has issued a ruling that will end legal termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. Many of us are afraid right now, this is why we want to express unity in a just cause.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jwhu2kjPWupzTBIY7CAJOP0Pa8i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2020-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"#polish_women_resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
