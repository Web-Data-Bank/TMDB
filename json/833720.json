Their decisions are incontestable and irrevocable. But when a local dog receives a death sentence, it may turn out that this time the thugs are trying to bite off more than they can chew. Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs is an innocent child’s play as compared with this perverse gangster cinema with a remarkable awareness of the convention, sense of humour and distance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aggkEPeDK1blgFTM2wdkUYJ9dZx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rough","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
