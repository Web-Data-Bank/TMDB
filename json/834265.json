She chooses the Abruzzo region, which meets her expectations above all from a naturalistic point of view, but during an excursion she ends up getting lost in the woods of the Majella. From here starts the story of how you try to survive, completely alone, until the experience becomes something else for her, a moment of transformation and catharsis, triggered by the mythical and spiritual inspiration of the nature she is encountering, and it will forever change the way you perceive yourself and the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3YMkPcumuAqVXIcKDrTVrfA5I0y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondazione Pescarabruzzo","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":154974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nohaybanda","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mani Nude","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
