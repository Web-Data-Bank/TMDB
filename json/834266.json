Not keen on their lifestyle, the old man tries hard to accept all the eccentricities of the young and liberal. Fortunately for him, a warm-hearted friend of Arvīds’ ex-daughter-in-law is always around to help and he seems to be a natural when it comes to children and other stubborn people. When Arvīds finds out that the young man is gay, he decides he has had enough.  Often, life is not that much about finding your place, as about learning how to share that place with others. This short film is a light and playful experience, looking into the definition of “normal” that varies so strongly from generation to generation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kccBDHkYilWwACJnefxwQmH5FPJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baltic Film and Media School","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":22246,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cardinal Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2015-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ordinary People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
