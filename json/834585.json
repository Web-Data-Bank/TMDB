This is a very different interview from London & Kendrick's Excellent Adventures. We go much deeper into the psyche of both guys and get their thoughts on the business in far greater depth than before. The boys are just as honest as ever but this time they are clear minded, insightful and thought provoking.Nobody tells it like it is quite like Paul London and Brian Kendrick and it makes some people in the business uncomfortable to know that more of their dirt and their truths are going to come out with the release of Volume Two.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pdMR73JuKn0qjkqbcfb54J8XCPo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London & Kendrick's Bogus Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
