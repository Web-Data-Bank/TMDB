Film director Helena Włodarczyk took the artist's sculptures hailing from various stages of her work to a metropolitan avenue. Even in highly urbanised surroundings, the works by Szapocznikow still seem imbued with the physical. An important role is played by formal experiments of the artist (e.g. sculptures of polyester). “I like to work with materials in which every touch leaves a trace. This physical contact with the matter gives me the sense of handing myself over to the sculpture”, as Szapocznikow explained. The title of the film refers to that very statement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
