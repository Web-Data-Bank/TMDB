The team joins bigfoot researchers like Steve Kulls (\"Monsterquest\") and Paul Bartholomew (Finding Bigfoot, Beast of Whitehall) who lead them on the search for their quarry. The Journey takes a deep look into the subject of bigfoot, but also what spurs people to spend their lives searching for a creature many believe doesn't exist. Along the way, the crew makes a stop in Whitehall, NY, home to an incident involving multiple members of law enforcement claiming to see a bigfoot in a field off a rural road. The crew has multiple unusual experiences during their various night investigations near Lake George, Whitehall, and Western Massachusetts. The Journey unveils some of that evidence.","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":"/jkdG3VgSKhVxJH6ci9Knf04i29g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100671,"logo_path":"/zU6uHxAsB6vlxwwvY8Il6FpbCds.png","name":"Small Town Monsters","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Trail of Bigfoot: The Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
