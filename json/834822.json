Inside the Zone every instrument instantly ceases to function and  every attempt to solve the mysteries has failed miserably. No  technological and biological creature has been able to find out what  lies within it.  On this important anniversary, 4 people unknown to each  other are about to access to the Zone, accompanied by a guide  able to circumvent the security systems.","popularity":1.15,"poster_path":"/uYoNPCEiwYGbsEvzwJPh0tLA0Nr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Villa Danelli Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Zone","title":"The Zone","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
