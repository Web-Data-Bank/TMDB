In a feature-length unique approach to historical analysis of these creatures, we don't focus on the latest technology or the most controversial theory. Instead, we look chronologically at what we've gotten wrong about dinosaurs throughout the short history of scientific study of these magnificent, misunderstood creatures, and see where paleontologists are digging today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greystone Communications","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dinosaur Secrets Revealed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
