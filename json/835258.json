In their collective movements as well as individual moments of concentration, anticipation and occasional forlornness, the adrenalin-fuelled adolescent protagonists seem to embody the frailty of the human condition awaiting an environmental change, much like an unexpectedly forceful current in a river.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/av1zHoBtCoadFhEUvqdmoPUJnUm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vidourle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
