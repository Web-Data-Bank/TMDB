In the film we follow Oringers, the inhabitants of Odoorn, through the winter. The Oringers all experience IJswee in their own way. You will also see the Icecounter (Rafael van der Ziel), who builds ice sculptures and drinks frozen milk. You see the Drenthe countryside changing with the weather. You see animations, archive material and you hear the mysterious sounds of IJswee in the music of Wietse de Haan. And there are two trumpet players, who welcome winter with their music and say goodbye to it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6bP3NESXZzID7WZhmFabCJPrUkL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IJswee","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
