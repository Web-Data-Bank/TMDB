Just six months ago, no one knew about \"Help\" and how easy it really is to help. But thanks to a group of people who have decided that they will talk about helping others in the language of technology and modern media, we are increasingly seeing a circle held by two brackets in different cities of the country. This film contains a brief history of \"Help\" for those who do not know anything about it, an introduction to the team that is mad in its bravery, as well as the cycle of events that is happening with \"Help\" now. A trip to Sasha Gudkov's hometown, a trip and a performance of the team at the Avaz festival in Kazan, where they work in a car, on a boat, walking around the city, coming to concerts and talk a lot about \"Help\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mqnSgqwMwdbR97ur6wcbHfHO4iU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Help Doc","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
