He lived a double life: his wholesome appearance and cooperative nature eluded cops for years while he engaged in a hedonistic lifestyle filled with violent sex that often went too far. Through exclusive interviews with McArthur's close friends and the homicide investigators who cracked the case and expert analyses by leading criminologists and forensic psychologists, this two-hour special uncovers how McArthur targeted, terrorized and murdered members of Toronto's LGBTQ+ community, The Village, for nearly a decade before getting caught.","popularity":0.733,"poster_path":"/r2IPcWNoP2t6MildN87HNYuiep6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catching a Serial Killer: Bruce McArthur","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
