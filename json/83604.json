Her cheeky hits (\"Genie in a Bottle,\" \"Come On Over, Baby,\" \"What a Girl Wants\") are followed by songs from Mi Reflejo, her Spanish-language album, and My Kind of Christmas, her holiday release. She has sweet duets with R&B legend Dr. John on \"Merry Christmas, Baby\" and balladeer Brian McKnight on \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\" and shares the stage with rapper Lil' Bow Wow (weird, but it works) on \"So Emotional\" and \"Christmas Time.\"","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":"/6xZ1fsPOYeqkgO6jV1laeYysnhc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christina Aguilera: My Reflection","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
