The forces of nature colliding under the Carpathian Mountains and time itself shaped its hydrography. The wildlife that evolved here fights a daily fight with the elements and human activity. In this country, where rivers forced their way wildly, creeks showered onto fabulous forests, thermal springs and changeful moors vary the environment, the wildlife is more diverse than anywhere else in Europe. This is the story of Hungary's wild waters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7pZZmPp6xgMtUU5szO2Ei4j5qn1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vad Víz Stúdió","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2021-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vad víz – Aqua Hungarica","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
