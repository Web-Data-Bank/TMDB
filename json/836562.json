Yeah we couldn't find anyone else at the moment to host this show so Dan was hanging out and we needed someone. Again we apologize.  Either way it's a really great show featuring two of the best wrestlers in the world, Solo Darling and Viper. It's just three gals...I mean two gals and Dan talking about  wrestling and haggis. Trust us... you might enjoy it!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eDEk2ClwBPIqk5uX4dD8tQMDx8K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorry You're Watching This: Viper & Solo Darling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
