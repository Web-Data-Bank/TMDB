A flood of colours emanating from video feedback, warring tribes displayed through a modified oscilloscope, and a flurry of gun violence repeated via luminance keying dominate stations one by one. Abstract imagery through analog video glitch techniques forewarn the passive television viewer that the far-right American political system to come will not be the result of a sudden shift. Instead we will see a rise of increasingly conservative policies followed by a moulding of public perception by broadcast television.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/id42tLDA0nnzkyYFxhFCg5H1Fwu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cable Box","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
