Jesús, an amateur thief, holds prisoner a group of clients. But nothing is what it seems. Behind the gates of the drugstore the story will unfold in two times.

And on the other side, to the past, unveiling how Jesús got caught in this situation, where the hostages are not the real victims, but something more sinister.
