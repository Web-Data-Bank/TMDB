In such a world, women's variability and the ability to instantly change their decision to the exact opposite is no longer a disadvantage, but an advantage. According to the authors of the almanac, it is the ability to change your mind that makes a woman a heroine of today. Because in a world that has gone completely mad, there is no place for final decisions.","popularity":0.975,"poster_path":"/ptL46IsqaCbVRPW1itMieBuDFk2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I changed my mind","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
