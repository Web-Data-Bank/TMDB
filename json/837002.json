Filmed against a scene of glossy anthuriums and fluorescent birds of paradise, a vibrant bouquet dissolves, revealing a portrait of an African body wreathed on a steel pole, in various states of limbo: an analogy for queerness itself. In a state of nature, pole dance – like queerness – is innocent. However, stigma attaches a perceived and misconceived immorality. Through a system of prisms and mirrors, attention is first drawn to an anthurium’s spike-shaped inflorescence, which bears small flowers with perfect male and female parts. Focus then shifts to a pole in perspective, superimposed against the lingering red silhouette of an anthurium’s queer premise, the desire to be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
