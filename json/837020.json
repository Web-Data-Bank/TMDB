Six years later, a new story emerges, one filled with hope, love and beauty. Through interviews from community members, including Dorian Johnson, who was with him that day, and Michael Brown’s father, this documentary illuminates the stories from within the city since that time, including the dreams and desires of its citizens to move beyond the limited and all-too-common narratives of racism and division in the media. The film reveals the humanity within the people of Ferguson, who represent all of us, and the communities in which we live.","popularity":1.632,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":65927,"logo_path":"/6rf8qmo7Q4SP3qhxZHAwaE4AKv6.png","name":"Yoruba Saxon Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ferguson Rises","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
