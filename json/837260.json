By staging the most spectacular and lunatic stunt ever. The Rock 'Til You Drop extravaganza took place on the 21st September 1991 across 4 venues; Sheffield Arena, Glasgow SECC, Birmingham NEC and finishing it off in Wembley Arena. The band started at the BBC TV centre doing a playback performance on 'Going Live' to kick off the day... They kicked off in Sheffield on stage around 2pm, then headed down to Glasgow were they arrived on stage 2 minutes late (4:32pm), 30 minutes late on stage in Birmingham (7:30pm) and when the band arrived at Wembley they was 50 minutes late! But that didn't stop the band from making a record of their own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96400,"logo_path":"/lTzSvArTDdffkHuXLEfy9IX1PLE.png","name":"Polygram Music Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1991-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Live Event","title":"Status Quo - Rock 'Til You Drop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
