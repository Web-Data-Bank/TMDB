Many people because of this, will stop thinking and lose their imaginations.  The values that people have are saturated by the many things that are seen as if they are necessary that really aren't, only to keep some people existing.  Therefore, this is the definition of the rules and the reason for making them spend and waste.  Intentionally or not, people don't realise the values that have been forced upon them and they just go along with the rest.  Although being caught in the past, they question the shadows of the time people have sought prosperity of richness.  When they seek new thoughts, they become unsure as there is nothing there.  Even in a uncertain time as such, it is hoped that people can look into a whole new world with a new vision.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mRfOkQNiXVCICBh4HQEs593JAQ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caterpillar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
