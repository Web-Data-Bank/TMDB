An unknown place and time. An anonymous, timeless man slides into a devastated industrial building. He is enclosed by ruins and rust, witnesses of time.

A solitary figure fluctuates on an abyss.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/baHHNfPqXxZiJo37tnOLH7cnm93.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51654,"logo_path":"/qTkVCfQFiM0q9sYn9pXKOsZdH2B.png","name":"Momento Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rust","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
