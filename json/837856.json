From ancient times this was the time of year when the Sami people hunted reindeer. A Sami boy dreams about this hunt in the beginning of the film. Suddenly he hears singing, he has never heard before – it is called joik. He falls in love with the joiker: the Daughter of the Sun. To keep her, he needs to hide her for three days and three nights without lighting a campfire inside his tent. In a cloudy night though he takes a chance, but the star, which is her father, sees her through the cracks in the clouds and takes her home. The boy looses the Daughter of the Sun but has learned to master the power of the joik. He gets a large herd of rein deer, and experiences the greatest love of all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hhao4cSsrBbObJbA8dXrwoFSxum.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trollfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Northern Sami","iso_639_1":"se","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daughter of the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
