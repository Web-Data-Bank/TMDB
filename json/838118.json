A house is sinking, the river has overflowed, no one will stay. The river carries them all away. On the roof, Lakis Lazopoulos, as a modern Odysseus, sinks like our life sinks today. The past begins to knock on the door and asks to take a stand. The history of the modern Greek from 1960 until today, the dissolution of us, the rise of the ego, the descent of emotions, the transition to corruption, the ridicule of the Greek in history. Chryssa Ropa, as a modern Penelope, tries to keep the house, the child, the life that is lost. But love and affection are crushed in the years of infidelity and greed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gu4giynEgIK45lUulZZGbKmWzcx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2010-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":178,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O viopalaistis sti stegi!","video":true,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
