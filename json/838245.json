Spaces of association unfold, a train of thoughts. The boundaries between factual and memory blur. How much of personal history can be read more globally? Visual portraits of Europe’s remote places away from the typical tourist hotspots set the stage for this film. Landscapes in flux, images of movement that visually evoke long journeys on trains, ferries and public transportation. The underlying sound compositions by Dutch musician Machinefabriek evoke isolation and alienation, yet are conciliatory and warm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Another Europe is an essay film rooted in experimental cinema and queer storytelling.","title":"Another Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
