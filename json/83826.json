But that s not the only thing that makes Pingo unique. He also happens to be raised by a most unlikely duo, Lou and Buddy, two birds of prey who initially set out to make a meal out of Pingo and end up taking him in as their own. Pingos toe tapping skills not only catch the eye of a darling young female penguin, Bella, but they could be the key to stopping the vile hermit crab, Gabby, and his dimwitted sea lion sidekick, Thrasher, from destroying a colony of penguins that are home to Pingos long lost parents.","popularity":1.613,"poster_path":"/8L4hZUkAbLvV47dwKsQim8XTjaR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19540,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaiam Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":4422,"logo_path":"/1XUBlFEBEVM6gnv8vJ8BfQ879z8.png","name":"Renegade Animation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's just winging it!","title":"Tappy Toes","video":false,"vote_average":3.3,"vote_count":3}
