What I want to express with this series is disassembling and restructuring the human sense. When we focus to one object, we can't feel other objects. I try to express this feeling with many still images taken from many little different positions. The many pictures vibrating randomly converge into one average image. This method is an imitation of depth of field of optical lens. Please feel the comparison between the human looking and the camera focusing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncertain Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
