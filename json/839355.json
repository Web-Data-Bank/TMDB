The factory manager exploits the workers’ rising discontent by colluding with a traitor within the workers’ ranks to instigate a strike in the factory, part of a devious ploy to take over the factory from the benevolent but incapacitated factory owner/boss. The colluders create dismal working conditions and make use of every opportunity and incident to raise the call for a strike, to sour industrial relations in a bid to close the factory down so that they can coerce the boss to hand over ownership.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pNG7lfoIJx2Bl82FFcikx2reEnR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malay Film Productions Ltd.","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1957-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mogok","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
