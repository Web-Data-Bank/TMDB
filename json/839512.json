Now, to save her home in Malawi from extreme weather, she faces her greatest challenge: persuading Americans that climate change is real. Traveling from Malawi to California to the White House, she meets climate sceptics and despairing farmers. Her journey takes her across all the divisions that shape the USA: from the rural-urban divide, to schisms of race, class and gender, and to the American exceptionalism that remains a part of the culture. It will take all her skill and experience to help Americans recognise, and free themselves from, a logic that is already destroying the Earth.","popularity":2.509,"poster_path":"/bwIo7GVX7codr2IQU7RpZMMvGrz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MW","name":"Malawi"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Chichewa; Nyanja","iso_639_1":"ny","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ants and the Grasshopper","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
