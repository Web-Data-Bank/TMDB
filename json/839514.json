Founding band-member Dunstan Bruce is 59, and he is struggling with the fact that the world seems to be going to hell in a handcart. Twenty years after his fall from grace, Bruce is angry and frustrated, but how does a retired middle-aged radical get back up again? In this punk version of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, Dunstan is visited by the antagonistic ghost of his anarchist past – his alter ego, ‘Babyhead’ – who forces him to question his own life, sending him on a search for his long-lost anarchist mojo. Following Bruce’s personal voyage of rediscovery, redemption, and reawakening, I Get Knocked Down acts as a call to arms to those who think activism is best undertaken by someone else.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/eK9fxgdWPmcp71CWC7137fXh8k5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Get Knocked Down","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
