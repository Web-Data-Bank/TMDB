When Father Romeo looks at young Marcus he can tell, much like himself, that the boy is drawn to the church as a means to hide his true nature. Marcus knows that being selected as an Altar Boy is an honor so when Father Oaks commands the boy to undress him, there is no hesitation. Dakota, while enjoying his encounters with the Priests, is confused by the conflicting messages and in the secrecy of the confession booth, he raises his concerns with Father Fiore.","popularity":0.986,"poster_path":"/psx6YQdpVIw67QWRJOIB5RpkhRg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bareback Network","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yes Father 2: Blessed Sacrament","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
