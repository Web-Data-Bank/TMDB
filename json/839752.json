This film was a revelation for Boris Moiseev and Maria Arbatova. The acting of the recognized Runet stars leaves no chance for critics to find in this masterpiece at least a hint of nonsense and farce - each frame has been hard-won and repeatedly directed.  The hardest cynic is forced to make him cry like the hardest cynic to suck.  Of course, everyone should watch this film and get something of their own from it. Something that will make every viewer more human and petty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pSVTZFWoRWlKdq4Eak4PKoxqgdQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albert and Suren in the gay capital of Russia - Izhevsk","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
