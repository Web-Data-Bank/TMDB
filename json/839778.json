The gig was the culmination of a months retrospective celebrating the music, films and words of Skids front-man Richard Jobson. A sold out gig was caught on film by the team Jobson uses to shoot his movies. The result is a high energy performance that captures everything that was great about one of the best loved bands to come out of the Punk/New wave era. The film is inter-cut with an interview with Jobson on stage by crime novelist Ian Rankin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f7fnn3AjaB2MZZQxE4lbaPnJdVA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skids Live 2010","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
