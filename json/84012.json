The film CYCLING THE FRAME is now an unusual document.  21 years later, in June 2009, Beatt &amp; Swinton re-traced the line of the Wall that once isolated West Berlin. THE INVISIBLE FRAME depicts this poetic passage through varied landscapes, this time on both sides of the former Wall.","popularity":1.074,"poster_path":"/8DfrDiS8fhuyRdcLM8zwcwUjOB7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17177,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ausw√§rtiges Amt","origin_country":""},{"id":17178,"logo_path":"/eXbcwmrHmVmgmRFPoYZfbLkt884.png","name":"Filmgalerie 451","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goethe Institut","origin_country":""},{"id":161584,"logo_path":"/sPdlHrkSpsIKkm5burGL5QB7PbX.png","name":"ZDF/3Sat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invisible Frame","video":false,"vote_average":7.143,"vote_count":14}
