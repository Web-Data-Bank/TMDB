Life got cancelled. People were struggling. Hereâ€™s an emotional and entertaining true story shot live, during the pandemic, about courageous people who came together, despite the risk, to share their love with one another.  The film opens in Times Square on NYE 2020. Everything seemed right with the World. Fast-forward six months into the pandemic, hundreds of artists from all different performance art genres are invited to come together over the course of several consecutive days, culminating in a group costume parade event on 10/10/2020 to witness the only live performances happening ANYWHERE. The goal was to lift each other's spirits during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. There were over a dozen genres represented including acrobatics, live music, magic, dance, and even a wedding. Dozens of unscripted live interviews were recorded and the event proved a huge success. The film captures the rawness of what it was like living during this unprecedented time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k2SjM15rBC15EqEzjo7kl5lTUx4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bruckman Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"'Non-essential' performing artists proving otherwise.","title":"Coalesce","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
