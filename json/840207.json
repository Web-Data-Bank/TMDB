Prior to filming the SOUND OF ONE, Bartlett studied dance as a student enrolled at the Inner Research Institute. His teacher was Martin Inn. This student-teacher relationship evolved into a collaboration in which Barlett and Inn scripted a summer workshop course entitled The Application of T'si Chi Ch'uan to the Art of Filmmaking. SOUND OF ONE is the fruit of that program, a melding of the two disciplines. SOUND OF ONE records the short form of the T'ai Chi dance as a solo figure moves through changing landscapes – oceanside to forest to volcano peak – to represent the five elements: water, wood, fire, air and metal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Ap02hXx8yUjAlbAQRniLffSpUol.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sound of One","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
