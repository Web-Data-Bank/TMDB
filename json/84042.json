With his companion Samplan, he finds himself at the head of a handful of soldiers dissatisfied with their fate and a band of brigands. They steal money from the rich to give it to the poor, like highwaymen, vindicators with a big heart. In their eyes, things cannot go on like this, in this country which seems given over to the decadence of the nobility and the whims of an indolent king. Gaspard and his troupe are responsible for making it known.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/bGWTWqIS7sn5RDwDmlogUJQ7GxA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions André Hugon","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1935-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn Over France","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
