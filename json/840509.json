Thousands of birds, both native to Australia and from around the world, find sanctuary in the billabongs of Arnhem Land, feeding on the fish, insects and flowers that flourish there. Apart from their beauty, the birds serve the useful purpose of helping to keep the balance of nature in the wilderness areas of Australia’s far north. Close photography makes it possible for some of the more interesting birds to be carefully studied. The film’s soundtrack is perhaps the most unique ever recorded, bringing us the thrilling sound of the voices of thousands of birds breaking the quiet of the virgin bush.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jnhyx5Q1uVuNYdlIucbgMW60naS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian National Film Board","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birds and Billabongs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
