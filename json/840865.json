One of them is wearing gákti, the Sámi traditional costume, to attract Norwegian women. The second one believes it unethical to do this, and the third is bitter that he doesn't attract women when he wears the gákti. Indigenous Police is a Sámi short film told with humor and political sting. It is an identity satire about how people, both the Sámi and the majority population, consciously and unconsciously define what is the right way to be Sámi.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n8oTPZUSyEMxZpM6zu6osjxjKsz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130621,"logo_path":"/1gKc229FHl8euaG10n0CQS5p4iY.png","name":"Rein Film","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2021-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Northern Sami","iso_639_1":"se","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indigenous Police","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
