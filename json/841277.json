The qualities of light and time are used to heighten the properties simple acts and objects may take on when mediated by these two elements. The primary subject of the film, then, is not an event, nor a story, but a sense of an artist's process and her relation to the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pauline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
