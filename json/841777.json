This project is a film/video re-imaging of my 16mm film s o f t s h o e from 1987, made via optical printer from S8 film imagery shot ten years earlier on an east-west trip across Europe; using home-movies as the original source, this work is a cross/weave, or perhaps more a chance-encounter, with images from rural Romania, traces from the contemporary art exhibit documenta 6, Kassel, Germany, and a ride on the iconic escalator of the Centre Pompidou, Paris. Three decades later and with the advent of multi-track video I revisited this film, using it now as template –– for the lush, layered, and intentionally subversive collage of still and motion that is softshoe for bartok.” –Holly Fisher","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eCS6v8GlnlHCKfnUry0t7NjSkp4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Softshoe for Bartok","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
