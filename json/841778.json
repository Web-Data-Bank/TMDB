The result is a highly personal, open-ended meditation on the passage of time, historical trauma, and liminal physical and emotional spaces that embodies Fisher’s radically multilayered approach: she juxtaposes multiple layers of visual and aural materials not only to create a rich visual experience, but to bring into play a dizzying and cross-pollinating array of ideas. The soundtrack features composer Lois V Vierk’s long-form piece, “Words Fail Me,” a work inspired by Vierk’s experience as an eyewitness to the fall of the World Trade Center, twenty years ago.","popularity":1.116,"poster_path":"/5GyilWQCu2diC8L2UI08NVk35Pw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of the Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
