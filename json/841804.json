With footage from several important temples in Kyoto and Tokyo, as well as interviews with practitioners of Noh and Butoh, Old Japan Now seeks to explain some of the historical significance that descends from the Shinto religion and early animism.  More poetic than clinical, the film is part diary and part haiku, considering the spiral path of ritual (KJ Mohr).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xGbRLDNA9qTfnS9BKOFJgIJFYRk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Japan Now","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
