Potent forces fight to maintain the status quo in a medical industry created for quick fixes, rather than prevention; for profit-driven, rather than patient-driven, care. Healthcare is at the center of an intense political firestorm in our nation's capital. But the current battle over cost and access does not ultimately address the root of the problem: we have a disease-care system, not a health-care one. After decades of opposition, a movement to introduce innovative high-touch, low-cost methods of prevention and healing is finally gaining ground.","popularity":1.013,"poster_path":"/cV6ALT3WUYrfm8D5YsrKhhsEEhM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How can we save our badly broken healthcare system?","title":"Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":11}
