Tamako, a popular fortune teller, has been living there alone with her son, Tadao, for years. Because he has intellectual disability and autism, their neighbors often complain about his unpredictable behaviors. One day, Tamako is informed that a room is available in a group home owned by a company that runs the community workshop Tadao works at. Residents there all have intellectual disability but are living together to be independent from their families. Tamako decides to let Tadao move into the group home, but the sudden change of environment confuses him.","popularity":1.123,"poster_path":"/bqeciod0mDR4yqugXWY1iIqXk6M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168206,"logo_path":"/AmGd7pnZZ8VWTrOtlVZAm3siR4C.png","name":"Happinet Phantom Studios","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lone Ume Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
