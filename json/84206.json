Narrated by Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons, \"The Hittites\" brings the fascinating history of this mighty empire to life with expert interviews, stunning cinematography, dramatic reenactments, and visual effects. Highlights include a breathtaking recreation of the controversial battle of Kadesh that decimated the armies of Egypt's Pharaoh Ramesses II. Based on the actual words of the Hittites, deciphered from ancient clay tablets excavated in the 20th century, their story unfolds as beautifully as it written almost 3500 years earlier.","popularity":1.274,"poster_path":"/mJP8f2DmSJVigOeo1NfCxR40fOy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hittites - A Civilization that Changed the World","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
