Interviews with Swapna and Shucheta’s families and neighbours are interspersed with the stories of ordinary Indian queer and trans people, as well as activists and advocates, all of whom are dealing with their own experiences of the label “unclaimed”, while fiercely fighting for their rights to live and love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uTBVEpEO3VGqRnrjnINBZEPKhV4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156044,"logo_path":"/kO8GI2uSACNl8BvFT9rCee3O107.png","name":"Sappho for Equality","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2013-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And the Unclaimed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
