Long-time collaborator Danny Cohen’s feature documentary reveals a woman who finds power in sharing her vulnerability. Recording her innermost thoughts on a Dictaphone over a period of three years, Courtney begins her slow acceptance of Danny Cohen’s camera. This unique filming process mirrors Courtney’s gradual search for purpose and emergence as an artist embracing her place in the world.","popularity":0.983,"poster_path":"/8ZRJ7F4xx6O2b4vsm3O5tCmYIwn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98157,"logo_path":"/fLczneIGOqD0rbbN3oAw74Abh97.png","name":"Film Camp","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anonymous Club","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
