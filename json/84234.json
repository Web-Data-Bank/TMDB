After medical student Ted Allison becomes a guinea pig for Morris, the professor imagines that Allison's fianc√©e, a beautiful concert singer Isabel Lewis, wants to break off the engagement because she prefers the professor as a more \"mature\" lover but in reality loves Eric, her accompanist. In order to bring Ted back from his trance-like states, Morris commands him to perform a cardiectomy on recently deceased or living bodies in order to use serum from their hearts as a temporary antidote. When the serial murders seem to coincide with Isabel's touring schedule, ace reporter \"Scoop\" McClure gets on the mad scientist's trail.","popularity":3.412,"poster_path":"/wq5vrKcGYf7Iv4jiy286rDYmDJu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Sensation in Horror!","title":"The Mad Ghoul","video":false,"vote_average":6.167,"vote_count":24}
