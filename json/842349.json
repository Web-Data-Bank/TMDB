Like her, a generation is rising up to fix the world. Everywhere, teenagers and young adults are fighting for human rights, the climate, freedom of expression, social justice, access to education or food. Dignity. Alone against all odds, sometimes risking their lives and safety, they protect, denounce and care for others. The earth. And they change everything. Melati goes to meet them across the globe. At a time when everything seems to be or has been falling apart, these young people show us how to live. And what it means to be in the world today.","popularity":1.704,"poster_path":"/tRknHtQVKpd6EQGOwDFKrP8HSCP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":836,"logo_path":"/93zzVd8ijSExx6DhVI4Xqj8WmOJ.png","name":"Elzévir Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":181255,"logo_path":null,"name":"All You Need is Prod","origin_country":""},{"id":181256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Mother Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Chichewa; Nyanja","iso_639_1":"ny","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bigger Than Us","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":12}
