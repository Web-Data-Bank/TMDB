John the Baptist condemns this union and is imprisoned by Herod, who nevertheless fears eliminating him given the reputation of the prophet. At a banquet that Herod offered to his hosts, Salome performs a dance that exalts the generosity of Herod ready to perform under word in front of his hosts, a wish to Salome. Herodias advises him to ask for the head of John the Baptist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tQrSQ3xCSf9goKbOcpRQuX2qiYL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In memoriam Téo Hernández","title":"Salomé","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
