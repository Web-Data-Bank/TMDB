It became the song of democracy, the people's requiem, and the horn of freedom.  For decades, WU Le-tian narrated the famous story of Taiwan’s very own virtuous thief – Taiwan’s Robin Hood – \"LIAO Tian-ding\". In the era of martial law, he used fantastic stories as a cover for arousing rebellion, and a guerrilla-style strategy to disrupt the state media. With an audience of millions, the common people was viewed WU as their very own Robin Hood!  Surviving prison, escaping the jaws of death and disappearing without a trace for a decade, rumours have unceasingly circulated about the reappearance of the legendary virtuous thief.Today, in the raging storms of social unrest and rebellion, the legend has indeed quietly reappeared. The hero is alive!
