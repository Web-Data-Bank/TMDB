It is here, where our identities converge rather than diverge, where the line between gay and straight begins to blur, that the conversation of the next generation is already taking place. What does it mean to be a man? What does it mean if you're not? 'I'm Not Gay' utilises a fusion of documentary and fictional story telling, dance sequences, and science, to tell a new story of masculinity - and the toll it takes on those who defy it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9o7oNu4NMiGzsH7z8ONrVLdfJqq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm Not Gay","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
