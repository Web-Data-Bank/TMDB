He became famous for his relationship with the Philadelphia Orchestra, which he served as Musical Director from 1936 until 1980. Under his direction, the orchestra developed its legendary warm, textured, romantic “Philadelphia” or “Ormandy” Sound. Claude Debussy (1862–1918) and Gustav Holst (1874–1934) belonged to a generation of composers that influenced the musical output of the early champions of modernism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ormandy Conducts Holst and Debussy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
