Without any special effects, Miguel √Ångel Rios filmed these astonishing scenes on location in Mexico's state of Morales over several months to compile hundreds of shots, some only a few seconds in length. Art in America called this artwork \"a cinematic tour de force\".  Each handmade orb is roughly the size of a grapefruit. In groups, their movement evokes a migration or an invasion--ambiguous behaviors that Rios offers as symbols of the historic intermingling of cultures across the Americas.  Rios asks, \"Are we witnessing some kind of game, or is it a catastrophe in the making? The viewer is placed in an all too familiar situation: that of witnessing the rapid unfolding of events (often catastrophic) that remain elusive, beyond comprehension.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Stones","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
