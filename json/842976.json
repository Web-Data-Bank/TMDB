The much debated question of the relationship between humans and large predators is addressed here from an unprecedented point of view: that of the shepherd dog. The camera follows the training of a dog according to the ancient method that will prepare it to care for an entire flock by itself. After training, he will be welcomed by a family whose previous shepherd dog was killed in the pasture by a bear. At the same time, it tells of the journey of the most famous Slovenian wolf, Slavc, who, covering more than a thousand kilometres, reached the Alps, stopping in the Lessinia mountains. A balanced, unforced documentation that calmly recounts the theme of coexistence with the \"children of the bora\", be they dogs or wolves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vlfJqcW1LAfWeteQQooTXjSYuaa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astral Film","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sons of Bora","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
