But when one of his conquests ends in murder, he sets off a chain of events that takes him forever closer to his bitter fate.  For the first time, Prague’s Estates Theatre, where Don Giovanni premiered some 230 years ago, calls on a director from overseas to stage Mozart's opera. Will Alexander Mørk-Eidem’s new production break with its long tradition of the famous rake’s last day? Is his Giovanni an incorrigible slave to his instincts? Is he a provocateur? Or a mere catalyst around whom Mozart thoroughly depicts the constantly changing universe of female emotions?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6xE6czf2jplDLicwSXhIBL58aBK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Giovanni - NATIONAL THEATRE PRAGUE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
