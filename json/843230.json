Maybe you can't define it, but you know what it feels like, and you know it will be there. Deep in your heart, you know it won't go away.\r It's like candies in your pocket, which are all from different origins. However, do we only live for these \"candies\", and do we always live in the yearning for the good and happiness ? Perhaps, like the Chinese novelist Yu Hua wrote in his book\"To Live\": \"living is to feel the happiness and the hardship given by life; survival is nothing but the evaluation from others.\"\r In this film, we try to show joy in Xizhou by interviewing people of different ages and occupations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nkjwznVttggunB2nlrCOLrzuQtS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People of Xizhou","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
