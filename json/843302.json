She is called to the scene of a crime by her friend, Detective Kurt Blas. There’s been a murder… or has there? The body isn’t like anything either of them have seen, and the widow of the deceased issues a warning: “It’s in the light.” Soon, the bodies start racking up – and the remains are just as baffling. With mounting pressure from Captain Rose, Thea and her forensics team must work quickly to find the culprit… if there is one. The more evidence they find, the less it seems like a human killer. But what could be behind these deaths? How can they stop it? And what, if anything, is in the light?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qjtrGDuGBZRKV1KNTwPpsvBbqZV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are You Afraid of the Light?","title":"Shimmer","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
