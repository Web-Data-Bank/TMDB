The film deals with the move from the capital of Piauí to Oeiras in 1852, the ideas of modernity at the time and the problems that resulted from this process in people and in the city. Along with the idea of ​​progress of the railway, factories and steamboats, many families and workers were relocated from the central areas of the city to more distant parts. The traditional ways of life of these people coexisted, not free from conflict, with the will of civility of the local elites. With 4 interviewees, including architects, historians and researchers, the film also brings a rich set of images from different places in the city, such as the Center, the Parnaíba riverbank and the Poty Velho neighborhood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eYccu7yWGOitj1MSNisBVnE6BW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fogopagô","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camadas das Águas Invisíveis","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
