The camera is mounted on the bow of a ship ploughing forward through a squall, and as the boat lurches up and down, the image does too - meaning that the viewer experiences the (unpleasant) sensation of movement too. The canny composition means that the frame contains both the ship and the waves, each moving in different directions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3mqqI7FxH2U6iisfpK8F7skafK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19681,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warwick Trading Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1898-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ship at Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
