The narrator moves through issues of sex work, queer and feminine identity, class, immigration, consumerism, global health and quality of life. The dense narration is juxtaposed against a voyeuristic, bird’s eye view of a female bondage model struggling to be free from the ropes that bind her. Originally shot on black and white Super 8 film, this four and a half minute video invites its audience to question ourselves and the world we live in.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lxYNH4JzKoCmJ3ISa14TiYF2jDO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's My Mother Fucking Name","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
