Sholem Aleichem: Laughing in the Darkness tells the tale of the rebellious genius who created an entirely new literature. Plumbing the depths of a Jewish world locked in crisis and on the cusp of profound change, he captured that world with brilliant humor. Sholem Aleichem was not just a witness to the creation of a new modern Jewish identity, but one of the very men who forged it.","popularity":1.083,"poster_path":"/k5X4gevz5mSY3KESnZNoBHo26qY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-24","revenue":845188,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Before there was Fiddler, there was Tevye... and the man who created him.","title":"Sholem Aleichem: Laughing In The Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
