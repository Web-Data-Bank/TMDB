Transporting us into the world of Mad Max, we explore the eccentric world of the fans, their costumes, and their machines as these oddball fans find their place amongst the Mad Max community.  The documentary also follows original cast member, Bertrand Cadart as he continues his fight against stage IV leukemia and travels from his home on the Sunshine Coast to the “Wasteland,” the desert location of Mad Max 2 in Silverton, for the last time. Beyond the Wasteland not only celebrates life but the ability to change oneself through passion.","popularity":1.847,"poster_path":"/wE1A9fQFP9BhTXbP4lsPfDUR1tt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156247,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Picture Lot","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's more than a film.
