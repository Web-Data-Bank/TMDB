The contest was inaugurated by the American Basketball Association (ABA) at its All-Star Game in 1976 in Denver, the same year the slam dunk was legalized in the NCAA. As a result of the ABA-NBA merger later that year there would not be another slam dunk contest at the professional level until 1984. The contest currently uses fan voting, via text-messaging, to determine the winner of the final round.  The very first slam dunk contest was won by Julius Erving at the 1976 ABA All-Star Game. The current champion of the NBA Dunk Contest is Blake Griffin.","popularity":0.661,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2011 NBA Slam Dunk Contest","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
