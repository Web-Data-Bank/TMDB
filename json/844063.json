Rather than go up, their dream is to go sideways across the range’s most foreboding peaks, the Moose’s Tooth massif. It’s a fresh new way to explore the same landscape Washburn first discovered.  As the group endures rough conditions, disintegrating ropes, and constant rockfall, their desire to be the first to complete the audacious line grows into an obsession. But friendships begin to fray when Renan suffers a near fatal brain injury, forcing all three partners to decide what’s most important to them.","popularity":1.689,"poster_path":"/peCN6Cdf2ENfwb3VcA4dHNPdrZj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76403,"logo_path":"/29apFW9Vbo98hQIyIZvXKwnpL6i.png","name":"Visit Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8191,"logo_path":"/bXYH4HA4GqN5mAIn2pRdlqnDRyI.png","name":"Dogwoof","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A climb for the ages.","title":"The Sanctity of Space","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
