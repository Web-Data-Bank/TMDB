As digital nomads who become the creators of their impressive life stories on their own initiative, they are all sounding out the boundaries of a new era: between personal freedom and the dependence on algorithms and wifi, between self-fulfillment and self- exploitation - in search of meaning and support in a world that offers ever more possibilities and yet also seems increasingly fragmented.","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":"/nRjUyz8cntdja7MSDCgVWePNvrf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roamers - Follow Your Likes","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
