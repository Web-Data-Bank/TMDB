The women interact with each other, ride busses, work, and have longings: Rai for a husband, Créo for her lost daughter, Roxane for a career in modeling. Quitéria is naive, a gull for thieves. Cida has a husband and also a lover. While each woman gets what she wishes for (more or less), it doesn't always make things better.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/5kk7ux7ceNL5LjlD2XEZkkHMtcz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":345,"logo_path":"/hj2nqoG2F9COm16fqvM0YpY3jL4.png","name":"O2 Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2001-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Domésticas","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":16}
