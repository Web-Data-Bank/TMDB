Part mystery,  part biography,  part film noir  – the  documentary follows the stranger than fiction story  of this Australian born,  Oscar-winning filmmaker.  As  one  of Hollywood’s most  enigmatic f igures,  Farrow  was the  director  of some 50 films; a sailor,  a poet,  a  war hero,  best-selling author, a religious scholar,  a family man and a philanderer  – a man  who lived many lives  –  yet  who left behind no memoirs,  no interviews and no archival footage  – and  who today is  only a shadow in the pages  of film history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7dmi9a4wErACY8lcTqM3Zv2SutB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156336,"logo_path":null,"name":"Third Street Steps Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Farrow: Hollywood’s Man in the Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
