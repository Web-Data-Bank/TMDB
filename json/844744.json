Ten international directors, ten perspectives that intersect in the same period, with their authentic and more atypical universes than each other. A work that unites in isolation and expresses the impalpable. This film is a challenge, a bet: that of creation which persists despite everything within the constraints of the health crisis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jtqNa5qgCnhVjvVJjaBFbCEC4uU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Outbuster","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"10 FILMMAKERS GATHER IN ISOLATION","title":"Quarantaines","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
