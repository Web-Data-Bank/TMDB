Yōichi Kotabe was a character animator on the film, and used it as inspiration for the art direction of the video game The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002). Tomm Moore, director of the Oscar-nominated films The Secret of Kells (2009), Song of the Sea (2014), and Wolfwalkers (2020), has identified the film as a major influence.","popularity":3.024,"poster_path":"/hx68nhniEwkLpeaeyS5TOsKwlM1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5542,"logo_path":"/ayE4LIqoAWotavo7xdvYngwqGML.png","name":"Toei Animation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1963-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ten Thousand Wonders Leap To Life!","title":"The Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":11}
