Посещение","overview":"In November 1988, director Anatoly Syrykh met with Sergei Parajanov in Tbilisi to make a documentary about him. However, Parajanov was clearly not in the mood to talk about his art. As a compromise, Syrykh offers to talk about the artist and time. The tired, offended director of \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\" forbids Syrykh to film him. He agrees only to speak, recalling the most unpleasant moments of his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eWrKZ0LlKacHsOGl0P0VgKNjxjt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92705,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ukrainian Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sergei Parajanov.
