Goldin’s exhibition filled an entire floor at the Whitney Museum with pictures that chronicle her involvement and fascination with the alternative, “downtown” culture of New York City, Boston, Berlin, Tokyo, etc. Culled from a period that spans more than 25 years of taking pictures, Goldin’s desire to make a visual diary of her friends and lovers, as well as her own life, makes for a moving, highly charged, visual experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kFgSpicsv0a11JEO7sYGLZTuHM9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nan Goldin: In My Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
