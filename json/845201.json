After escaping out a window Pelly collapsed in the middle of the road and, as snow fell, succumbed to his injuries. That same morning Jeanette Reinhardt noticed Pelly’s bloody body from her window. Paul Wong, whom she was living with at the time, shot a roll of 35mm film documenting the scene – first from their window, and later at roadside. The quiet violence of the scene captivated Wong, and together with collaborator Kenneth Fletcher, the two embarked on a project to research the crime in full detail.\" – Allison Collins & Michael Turner, Mainstreeters: Taking Advantage 1972-1982","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nVIq2pdVFa8G1T9wfQS26VlAv70.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder Research","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
