The four walls and the open ceiling were monitored by video cameras. Wong entered the gallery, climbed a ladder and disappeared into the blue cube. Personally I was very uneasy about the work at this time. Knowing that [Kenneth] Fletcher was a close friend of Wong’s who had only months before committed suicide. I felt perhaps Wong would attempt his own cathartic self-mutilation as we all watched. As Wong’s slow pacing and wall assaulting became more intense the audience picked up the momentum of his energies. The intensity of the performance became overpowering. Not knowing how far Wong has planned his own movements, one began to wonder if he was indeed going to bash himself into unconsciousness as some observers had predicted.\" - Arthur Perry, Vanguard Magazine 1979","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bVQletqAvLY1qQ0HursxIu5wpfl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"in ten sity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
