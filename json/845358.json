The making of this film was like weaving a Persian carpet. Spread out over a period of two years I lived with this project, the filming was done in different seasons on carefully chosen locations and days. The complete crew and cast consisted of two people, a performance in itself. The eight different parts are shot on a variety of film emulsions, each with a specific characteristic. The raw material is digitally mastered and manipulated. The film has a peculiar structure, no beginning-middle-end but, eight parts that form a cycle. A short film, an endless film.
