For some time now, she has been seeing on her computer screen declarations of love that are as anonymous as they are passionate. Their author, Michel Alliard, a young executive in love, is too shy to dare approach Corinne directly. While trying to obtain more precise information on the identity of her mysterious suitor, Corinne becomes convinced, through an unfortunate combination of circumstances, that he is none other than Jacques Touret, her manager. This is the beginning of a series of misunderstandings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p6xjJc3Y3TuXSPZONPyRxjWHKIe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caméras Continentales","origin_country":""},{"id":1117,"logo_path":"/2X2uFeObxawiAajNDOf3Mhri5Wg.png","name":"Antenne 2","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'ordinateur amoureux","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
