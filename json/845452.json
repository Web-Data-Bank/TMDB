The popular horror tale was once popular with Japoanese studios, who released dozens of movies such as THE GHOST CAT AND THE MYSTERIOUS SHAMISEN (1938), GHOST CAT OF NABESHIME (1949), THE GHOST CAT OF OUMA CROSSING (1954), BLACK CAT MANSION (1958) and THE GHOST CAT OF OTAMA POND (1960). As with their previous projects, 3Y Film is looking to revive a long-lost tokusatsu genre for the modern age.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mkACS1pz76ose3kOy869RGuSnTq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144969,"logo_path":null,"name":"3YFILM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost-Cat Rhapsody","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
