It was produced just before AIDS had reached epidemic proportions. Twenty-seven individuals face the camera head-on as they speak about bisexuality, especially its more complex and engaging aspects, such as the relationship between sexuality, love, and friendship.  Without mincing words, they challenge the conventions of behaviour and human relations conveyed by commercial film and television, and refute the myths surrounding the notion of romantic love. The intent here is to question the constrictive mores that sanction only one style of love, and to examine the many forms of desire and sexuality experienced in our culture, approaching them from a variety of perspectives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q6aBlXRhv6PZVusiPy1E5js82nE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confused: Sexual Views","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
