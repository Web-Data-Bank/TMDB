Thirteen months later, Northern and Southern armies clashed again in the Second Battle of Manassas, a far larger battle that signaled the ascendancy of Confederate military prowess under the leadership of Robert E. Lee.  With its narrative sweep and stunning imagery, Manassas: End of Innocence offers audiences a glimpse into the lives of soldiers and civilians enmeshed in the turmoil of war. Shot on location in Manassas National Battlefield Park and within the surrounding community, the film showcases such landmark features of the battlefield landscape as the Stone House and the Stone Bridge over Bull Run and recreates key scenes from both battles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xBkDQ8H8VxXtqjMabNfx1motPKd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77172,"logo_path":"/h29wMyK1OWD572SUoufzWT0sIQr.png","name":"LionHeart FilmWorks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"End of Innocence","title":"Manassas: End of Innocence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
