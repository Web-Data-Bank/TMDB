Using imagery pulled from nature and culture, the fleeting nature of life is explored in a loose narrative structure. The camera frames life as scenes hung on the gallery wall and illustrates how communities, cliques, romances, flowerbeds, fireworks, caravans, agricultural mosaic landscapes, and even the stars and stripes of the American flag are all impermanent collections subject to the forces of change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A collection of moments that will not survive the digital blackout looming on the horizon.","title":"Impermanent Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
