Throughout the tape, unrelated images and ideas are juxtaposed as they might be in a surrealist painting by Magritte. The voice over operates as a kind of stream of consciousness guide through the underworld labyrinth of the human mind (with all its vicissitudes). Lines from poets are combined with skewed observations on contemporary culture. Performances of musical and artistic content coccur within abnormal contexts. Images and sounds themselves also distorted and manipulated by electronic processes to produce a distancing and alienation from reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cBhgJcsvwo9L3Th3C9als9RlmLp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Connecticut Papoose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
