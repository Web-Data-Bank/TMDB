Their task: Producing feature-length cartoons in ‘Disney-Quality’ with the newly founded ‘Deutsche Zeichenfilm GmbH’. To get trained, the Disney movie “Snow White” is re-traced frame by frame. After the final victory, one new feature-length production of quality shall be released every year from 1947 onwards. – that is the plan. Only in 1943, the first production is completed: “Armer Hansi” a 17-minute-long colour movie, realized with the effortful Multiplane-technology. The second film by the ‘Deutsche Zeichenfilm’ is only completed in 1946 – by DEFA. In the territories occupied by Germany, cartoons are produced as well, sometimes harmless ones, sometimes propagandistic ones. With excerpts from animated movies, life-action film documents, and witness reports by contemporaries, this documentary draws a picture of the cartoon production in the third Reich.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trickstudio Lutterbeck GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":156576,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Campo Film Köln","origin_country":""},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitlers Traum von Micky Maus - Zeichentrick unterm Hakenkreuz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
