Together with her, the viewers begin to appreciate what kind of people the staffroom teachers are, they witness the petty conflicts and also uncover the power games that go on behind the scenes. This self-assured debut from Sonja Tarokić about the individual's struggle within the system and the sheer effort required to preserve one’s integrity, also presents a complex study of an institution whose employees have taken on one of the most responsible roles an adult can have – to educate future generations.","popularity":0.718,"poster_path":"/jJheQoWjaNxClmh0VhskMJfoDQf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20916,"logo_path":"/kTzjchV1BXm1kSmR5vPRUnJfLil.png","name":"Kinorama","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2021-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Staffroom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
