Strapped to three builders planks (one of which had a large crack that I thought was spilled paint) I slept with one eye open, which was pleasant because I could see the view. Originally driven by the premise of backyard adventuring, using old climbing equipment, dodgy ladders and 4x4 recovery gear, a simple night out, 30-foot up, ended up being a reflection of how much I like trees, particularly the vulnerable Strzelecki gums I live among. Dinner, breakfast, bad coffee, podcast, and sitting on a park bench I should sit on more often, Big Gums is the story of a man who is no longer a boy, spending time with an endangered, iconic tree.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xpVfUdXpDSip45xxQXWAnEfoHyD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Instead of gallivanting around the world, and doing more in my own backyard, I thought ‘why don’t I spend the night in one of the Big gums,’ At least, that’s how the idea started.","title":"Big Gums","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
