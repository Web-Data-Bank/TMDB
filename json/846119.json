As the film progresses, the imagery mutates from nearly documentary to nearly surreal. An eyeball-clashing scene recalls \"Chien Andalou\" yet Devensky holds it on-screen much longer than Dali and Bunuel. Finally a chickens' skull is pounded to bits by a hammer. And each time we think (or wish) the final blow has fallen another follows. The camera peeks all the while and one is uncertain of what is more disquiting - the action on the film, or ridged stare of the camera. â€“Richard Koszarski, New York American","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven's Chicken","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
