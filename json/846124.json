It took place in two U.K. ports in October 1996: on the West Coast in Whitehaven, Cumbria (the last English slaving port), in an 18th century bonded warehouse used to store liquor and guns used in the slave trade; and on the East Coast in Hull, Yorkshire in Wilberforce House, the birthplace of the anti-slavery pioneer William Wilberforce and now a museum of anti-slavery. The production took place over a 3-week period that began Sept. 30, 1996.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4f4BrO64JU3ai60T4IWjuBGJtPA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Locus +","origin_country":""},{"id":156587,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Edge","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jazz Slave Ships","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
