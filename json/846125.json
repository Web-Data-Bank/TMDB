Some of the highlights of the ‘guided documentary’ include; a 3 foot, elderly and bizarrely dressed hunchback women as she totes a shopping bag of crumbs to fed the swam of pigeons encompassing her, street trash - both human and otherwise, perverts, bums and other assorted eyesores, exquisitely attractive men and women contrasted against filthy degenerates and freaks. Creative cinematography and montage enhances the many scenes and stories I waited for, or stumbled upon, during the several years of filming.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crowds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
