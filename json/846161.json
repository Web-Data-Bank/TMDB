I blew my veins out, I drank, I drank and I fucked chicks.  I never stole from the poor.  I’m HIV-positive since 16 years.  I’m repenting over time. I cleaned myself from my sins. I committed offenses but I never took a human life away. Not yet. Haven’t got an abortion either. These are mortal sins - and as for the others, I paid already.  I’ve been the worst of bitches but in this life already I’ve seen the light.  My name is Stela, I’m 42 years old and I spent 10 of them in jail. Chaos is my life.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3GCwNe9Y0JpSP9PPQvjw2iW3idx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2021-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stela, In the Name of the Father","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
