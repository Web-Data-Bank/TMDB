A love song for those who stayed, for those who migrated, for its musicians and its unique nature. A journey to Giromeri, Thesprotia, during the Easter days. Through the cinematic lens, we observe the everyday life of this little village and search for the roots of a very special tradition. An attempt - contrary to the relentless digitization of our times - to keep the analog memory of the Greek countryside alive: a life memento.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xiLPW8mKgSQCmI60jrF0mTOPixo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boo Productions","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2022-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memento","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
