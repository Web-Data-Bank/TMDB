Joined by modern psych heavies like Dead Meadow, A Place to Bury Strangers, Wooden Shjips, A Place to Bury Strangers, The Warlocks, and The Black Angels, APF 2009 set the tone for years to come, marking the festival as the definitive showcase of psychedelic rock.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bvrU8NIF9RYb7B3b0xZppFEyQ86.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Austin Psych Fest 2","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
