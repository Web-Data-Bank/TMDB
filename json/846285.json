This small propaganda film by Cines is part of a triptych commissioned by the Fascist government on the eve of its declaration of war with England and was never distributed. It is an extraordinary document because it was Fabrizi’s first screen appearance – although 1942 is the year associated with his debut in Avanti c’è posto… by Mario Bonnard, also produced by Giuseppe Amato for Cines – and was a precursor of his unforgettable cabman role three years later in L’ultima carrozzella (The Last Wagon) by Mario Mattòli, which Fabrizi himself wrote with Federico Fellini.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zMdhiSTUJINFxhAqGERGooiG2ga.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Teatro Delle Meraviglie - Documentario Di Propaganda N. 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
