On this day they get legal possession of their new house. They have privately purchased the burned out house directly from its owner. John Jeffery grew up in this house.  He has been living on the property since the fire destroyed the house a year ago. John is the last of the old families with deep roots still on the street. He is now surrounded by recent neighbours who are more interested in retrofitting character homes than the people who live in them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dFNJ2nE59EwDQkyOUwPF7P4Mq4w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EastVan 'John'","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
