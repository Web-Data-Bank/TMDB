On the left stills and titles/text of rodeo bronzes from the Glenbow’s collection. Wong’s work is an impressionistic portrait, which explores this alternative part of Alberta’s history. It is not meant to be a documentary/literal portrayal of the gay rodeo but rather it situates it in the context of the story of the west and the construction of identities. Wong’s work uses these frozen gestures to explore the complexities of gender and sexuality. In-relation-to the bronzes, the videos introduce movement to their very static image and highlighting our constantly evolving and shifting society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s2ramu0v8VOwu44Wxf6V1tBxqE9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 Hot 2 Handle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
