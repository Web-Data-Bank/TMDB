Inherent in the original film is not only the question of Black and white working together, but what happened to the civil rights movement in the 70s and its destruction. - Michael Rogosin","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/IbGNMQ2WIzWxtF1d3X0N5vwq83.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Working Together","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
