In this program, the four discuss when they first discovered they are gay; how they met their partners; major issues they have faced as gay couples; their children, ages 2 and 4, and the co-parenting experience; and what it means to them all to be a family. In addition, an overview of HIV/AIDS given by a health care professional distinguishes the virus from the syndrome, explains how HIV is contracted and transmitted, and promotes protected and informed sex for sexually active students, debunking a variety of myths along the way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rvnpUykPbQtWVOrA01QONL4aYsV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portraits in Human Sexuality: Sexual Orientation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
