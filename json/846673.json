The majority of gays and lesbians did not even consider parenting, fearing the stigma their children might face. By 2000, however, the U.S. Census Bureau indicates that a full one-third of lesbian couples and roughly a quarter of gay male couples had opted to become parents. This program captures six gay/lesbian families in their day-to-day lives. Two of these families are families by adoption, two are co-parenting families, and two are lesbian families by insemination. Man-on-the-street interviews as well as emotional testimonials from the 15 adults and 11 children featured in this film provide a range of perspectives on gay parenting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/DiHEPXsorG2or8thLLj7oRhyrV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rocking the Cradle: Gay Parenting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
