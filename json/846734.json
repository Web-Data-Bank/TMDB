Still Moving is an apt title because, as the documentary makes clear, 40 years is a long time for a dance company to exist, particularly one that was built and continues to thrive on collaboration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4c0z3uijpvxouw5D8DzVONrx5o2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Moving: Pilobolus at Forty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
