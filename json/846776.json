A man and a woman are about to leave a restaurant situated in the heart of the Lebanese mountains. They are suprised by fighter planes screaming past at low altitude. In the distance, war seems to be breaking out once more. Losing sight of the woman, the man starts looking for her. He finds her on the other side of the mountain. Together they sink deeper into nature, which becomes increasingly spectral, just like the slender thread that ties them to each other.","popularity":0.657,"poster_path":"/zl5E7ldKBeCANwXACG4rSSbD1e1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Khamsin Films","origin_country":"LB"},{"id":87779,"logo_path":null,"name":"Survivance","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2021-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The River","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
