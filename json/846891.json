The peace and sense of security offered by their enclave come at a price - the women increasingly long for contact with other people. Bucolic is an affectionate observation of people who live in a different way. It evokes a curiosity about their world and a desire to take a closer look.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jgqigQXrzlksKh9UyIquijrB0OS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wajda Studio","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":129370,"logo_path":null,"name":"EC1 LÃ³dz - Miasto Kultury","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":162245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polish National Film Archive","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2021-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bucolic","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
