From the root to the crown, it is home to a thousand different creatures, and over sixty animal species eat its fruit. The Almendro and the Great Green Macaw, the Lapa Verde, belong inseparably together. This magnificent parrot breeds in the knotholes of the Almendros and feeds mainly on its almond-shaped kernels. The two tropical beauties once had a promising relationship. The tree and its parrot were plunged into a deep crisis as a result of overexploitation and large-scale felling. Now the couple faces an uncertain future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rYVRQBAEvhjeWM9jduvFO2LWccT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ALMENDRO - BAUM DES LEBENS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
