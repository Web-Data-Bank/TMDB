America’s trusted cartoon darlings from the studios of Warner Bros., Paramount, and the “big animals” of the Disney family were supposed to give courage to the people at the homefront, to educate them, but also to simultaneously entertain them. Out of this mixture grew a genre of its own kind – political cartoons.  Insightful Interviews with the animators and producers from back then elucidate in an amusing and astonishing way under which bizarre circumstances these films partially came into existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p324RJdwZ3BQdjSR9wNj9GM8tbO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teleduction Associates, Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":106324,"logo_path":"/s3zNiYR6gmjGjI7fphaym7WuNLy.png","name":"A\u0026E Television Networks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cartoons Go To War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
