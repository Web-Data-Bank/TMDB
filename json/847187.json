Bringing light to the narratives and bodies of LGBTQIA + subjects, the multimedia project started in 2018 aims, based on biographical and poetic reports supported by audiovisual and photographic materials, to show the importance of these subjects in a collective space and not only private, especially for dissident subjects of sex and gender. We must understand the body as a political space and, the queer body, as a weapon against the subjective dictatorships of the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/scEMoO1M8Z6i86V79kgl6qqs3mB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dive In","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
