Forced in a marriage that she didn't want, Rosa entertained a secret relationship with Carmela, until their husbands found out and Rosa has been condemned to a life of shame. Claudia, fond of her grandma and her story, makes this film to celebrate her story and her courage, but most of all to show it to Rosa, who is now very old and affected by senile dementia, and unfortunately can't understand what the film is about when Claudia shows it to her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ldbMoTCCybSKMUiPqvZhteWcpYH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
