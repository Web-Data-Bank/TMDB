The programming began with the premiere of Alison Knowles’s “Natural Assembles and the True Crow.” For the piece, Knowles engaged in a dialogue with her own taped voice, which read aloud selections from various natural history books. Simultaneously, violinist Michael Goldstein provided an improvised score while dancer Jessie Higgins executed a number of one-movement phrases by following instructions on index cards. The second part of the night’s programming consisted of forty rapid performances—most sixty seconds or less—by various Fluxus members, including Yoko Ono, George Brecht, La Monte Young, and Nam June Paik. Ken Friedman and Larry Miller coordinated this portion of the event.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flux Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
