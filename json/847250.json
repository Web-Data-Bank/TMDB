In this documentary film girls and guys talk about their sexual sphere on social networks, some in a way more playful, others making it an art, still others for informational purposes, while some even built a career. Thanks to each of their points of view, an overall picture of the relationship between sexuality and the internet emerges for the new generations.","popularity":0.609,"poster_path":"/b6ImOEHNwtbaDcp3x1gMj05N0GP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156724,"logo_path":"/kwuT2R7PuuoPu0hEFTprOVcm7Qg.png","name":"RS Productions","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex&TheInternet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
