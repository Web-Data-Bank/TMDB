Understandable that this is not good to speak Siegfried. But he always likes to tell how it happened. And also of all the other dangerous adventures of Siegfried. How he defeated the dragon and became almost invulnerable, there would not have been a small linden leaf.  The kidnapping of Brunhild from Iceland and why Hagen von Tronje became Siegfried's mortal enemy. And of course Gunther's betrayal of Siegfried. And one question Alberich still has to this day: what really happened to the treasure of the Nibelung? Is he still lying on the bottom of the Rhine?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lWg2zT0e3d8tL8aat8rv4yRvdtM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dingo Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siegfried","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
