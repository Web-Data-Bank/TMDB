A new album, a new label, a new drummer, a new synthesizer wiz, and a new agency with the potential for a fresh management vision. This was our first gig of the 2000 naughty naughties & aside from three thoroughly distracted rehearsals we hadn't played together for five months. To add to the pressure the gig was going out as webcast & eventually become a DVD & live CD.  Somehow when the day came we forgot all this & it all morphed into a huge fluorescent fancy dress party with a bunch of our old tribal pals & friends old & new in a club in Portobello Rd. - for years the epicentre of our London lifetimes.  Recorded live at the Subterania Club, London, at the 'Zero 2 Infinity' CD launch party/gig in April 2000.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/46YCXJCm07KcwyF8hQKVc2MCp6v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gong High Above The Subterranean Club","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
