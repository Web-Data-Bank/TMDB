The group released their debut album, THE PRIMALS, in May 2018. With those songs in their repertoire, they toured four cities in Japan as well as Seoul, South Korea, and rocked the stage! This Blu-ray features footage from the Osaka performance on June 3, 2018! Not only does it contain the songs performed during the show, but it includes a whopping 90 minutes of behind the scenes “making-of” footage that is fully subtitled in English as well. Plus, as a bonus track, we’ve included Oblivion, featuring guitarist GUNN singing the vocals. This track was originally performed at the Sapporo show, the final stop of the tour, but rerecorded for this Blu-ray album.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9AaaTTfwkEOOqzY2javmbXXilIO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE PRIMALS Zepp Tour 2018 - Trial By Shadow","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
