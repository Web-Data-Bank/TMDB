Recorded in the blistering heat of July he positions the natural and manâ€™s failed attempts to exist in this unrelenting climate.  Against the background of the ravine he positions the study of an empty swimming pool. The graffiti covered pool used by skateboarders was part of a short-lived yacht club.  Another study is that of abandoned habitats and trailer parks on the shores of the Salton Sea. These play alongside images of the Joshua Tree.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sVofklG52V7aduGSj9MlWxjQGVk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scorched","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
