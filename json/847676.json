It was cold and pouring rain, but the demonstrators soldiered on. The Kiss-In was a favorite tactic of ACT UP because it defied the homophobia of the larger society, demonstrated a lack of fear and stigma around AIDS and fostered camaraderie among the demonstrators and within the group as a whole. It was also a whole lot of fun, which is evident from the footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hAzHOaD9i5gUjYnVZYE8q7oWumC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ACT UP Kiss-In (April 29, 1988)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
