Here he interviewed Palle, ten years old, who tells of a family life that was so burdened by violence, failure and loneliness that he could not stay at home. The director behind this documentary has dug up the sound recording from DR's archive, and with the help of animation she has given her own suggestion of how the touching interview could have looked in pictures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vbHGinUEFqYrC0F8D2fKkmAnOG4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frank Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2014-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Et børnehjem","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
