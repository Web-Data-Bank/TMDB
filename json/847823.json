The show is about gentrification, history and the rise of the far right and what happened to me on Brexit night.  Technically speaking, this is a recording of ‘Actions Speak Louder Than Words… Unless You Shout The Words Real Loud‘.  Recorded by Zak Annette and mixed and edited by Chris Hamilton and the artwork was by Jasmine Thompson.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pE8AXcUCUnb4g59qKOJHP5k4G8S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It’s In Your Nature to Destroy Yourselves, Pt. 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
