Rocko will go to any lengths to buy and sell his way up the social ladder. He thinks he likes the finer things in life, where a sardine sandwich is the height of sophistication. Wash it down with a fine Vintage Cider and he feels invincible. And if you don't want to play ball, well things may go a little out of bounds. Nothing, and I mean nothing and no one, will stand in the way of Rocko becoming Captain of the local Golf Club.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ykJedGQVrrhyH2hzPDCnS1dbR6o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GOLF - Tee Shot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
