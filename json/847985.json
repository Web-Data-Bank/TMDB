Describing itself as a “Musical Documentary about the dreams, hopes, fears and difficulties of disabled people”, Maybe Today was made by disabled filmmaker Brian Line (resident of Le Court Cheshire Home) with the support of local arts student Monica Mazure and members of the Le Court Film Unit, who were all residents of Le Court. It shows how residents raised funds to build an extension enabling everyone to have a private room. With its combination of folksong and a homespun (almost home movie) shooting style, it’s a curious but intriguing film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":156821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Court Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maybe Today","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
