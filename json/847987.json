Jocelyne watches the despair of her husband grow along with his obsession with the animal’s body, and his anguish takes root in her own mind. After a night of torment, they decide to go and bury the raccoon on the land where their house once stood in Joutel, a former mining town deserted since 1998. When they get there, the boreal forest is creeping in on the ruins of her former house, plunging Jocelyne into a deep nostalgia. Here, after a morbid picnic marking the raccoon’s burial, the couple meets a mystical being who leads them to make peace with their inner demons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7iikFvoBGv9T3YNylaggiiaG376.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21556,"logo_path":"/5wifS8KxFbogaT9cfrwu8Uz8rbg.png","name":"Unité Centrale","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":140114,"logo_path":null,"name":"H264 Distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joutel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
