The film dives into the conservation of her legacy in Moscow archives, what has been told and untold, and her vision of the future of a socialist feminist revolution. Love with Obstacles is the first part of the feature film Amor Rojo (to be completed in 2021) which will draw a fuller portrait of a figure that is able to bridge a century of feminisms, from first wave to fourth and fifth, across a couple of oceans, from Russia to Mexico and the Pacific. Through her legacy and its place in the history of ideas, the film seeks to draw a genealogy to today’s renewed surge of feminism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kEyVw4UUd7smkFzNxvZ9oV7qbae.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2020-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love with Obstacles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
