Since Woodruff continually calls for an imagined granddaughter, the child of his daughter who died before they could patch up a quarrel which estranged them, Nina gets Doll, a Follies girl, to impersonate the granddaughter, try to endear herself to Woodruff, and thus inherit the money. Doll would then be paid off and the relatives would get the inheritance. When Doll's administrations cause Woodruff to recover, Nina sends for Woodruff's grandson Ned, whom he disowned for marrying beneath him, hoping that Ned will send Doll away. When Ned seems to fall in love with Doll, Nina tells Woodruff that Ned and Doll are secretly meeting in the estate lodge. Woodruff investigates and finds that Doll and Ned are married and have a baby boy. Delighted, Woodruff forgives Ned.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zGtlgsiOCV40fbL4c8DcOjE6M7Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A delightful comedy-drama of footlights, fortunes, and felony.","title":"The Follies Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
