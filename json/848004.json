Accompanied by a feeble old corporal from the farm, they are forced to seek refuge at the home of General Phillip Bingham when the old soldier becomes ill. After the corporal's death, the general promises to care for the two waifs. Mary becomes his protegee, and John his gardener. Friction develops between the two newcomers and Willing and his wife Jessica, a couple living with the general who hope to inherit his wealth, until one day the general notices a close resemblance between a portrait of his deceased son and John. It is discovered then that John is actually the general's grandson. Thus legitimized, John weds Mary, and the general is pleased with his newly acquired family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p1n3YYgoL7obG3fu2fXP9gjlqhD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selznick Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1920-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Last Opportunity You'll Ever Have To See America's Prettiest Screen Star","title":"Everybody's Sweetheart","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
