Every year, on this exact date, an ant comes in under my front door and I watch it. For her, it’s the beginning of spring, for me it’s my mother’s birthday. The ant feeds its queen who then lays eggs and I ask myself the question of whether I do or do not want to have a baby just at the point when my mother, who is suffering from cancer, is approaching the end of her life.” –  Zoé Chantre","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4X0r1w3TlLhw7U3gYUI7zBOxB5L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Astrophore","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Perpetual Leek","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
