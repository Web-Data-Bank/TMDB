Gnarly backcountry lines, street rails, natural hits and sculpted booters, road gaps, limited but top-notch park/pipe, mixed in with never-before-seen footage on a car tow-in parking lot step-down, snowmobile tow-in river step-up and acid drops from light towers and trees. High-end filming and clean editing make this DVD a must see. Riders featured include Jared McCrum, Ryan Johannesen, Lane Power, Nick Brown, Joanne Dzierzawski, Tim Barker, Mike Weir, and Chase Harriman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/adFqYUKWX2xNSphjLv6nc6BLrB0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creative Differences","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
