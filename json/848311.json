While several narrators tell us about the most vivid colors in their dreams. The film consists of a collage of 16mm found footage I further processed and decayed using a gentle combination of bleaching techniques. This process allowed me to partially lift the emulsion from the film base and re-shift it and re-position it by hand. The narration is from the anthology Dreams by Delia Derbyshire. -- F.F.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sXTvbyCzbUYyWoHRIqWp9zyaofw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green and Red, but Terracotta Red","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
