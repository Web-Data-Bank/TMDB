The film’s title also translates literally into Eight Trigrams in Chinese. In the Asian culture, Eight Trigrams refer to the fundamental principles of reality, seen as a range of eight interrelated concepts. However, in contemporary China, when people talk about Eight Trigrams, they mostly refer to someone gossiping. The film is about a steel mill worker listening to gossips and her fantasies. The Director wanted to express the view that all things in the world are connected. Truth may be an illusion. Fiction could be real too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zvCjZ2WnIqGaEDfKcoJNoLVfFCd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2015-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gossip","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
