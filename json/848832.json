Those who buckled under the pressure and confessed spent over a year in prison. All the \"suspects\" were finally acquitted, but remain permanently scarred by the ordeal. This documentary is a dramatic reminder that indiscriminate arrests and convictions should be fought with the full force of the law.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Presumed Guilty - Creating False Confessions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
