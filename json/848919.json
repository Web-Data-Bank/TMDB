To save Spain's constitutionally elected government from the threat of a fascist dictatorship (which eventually prevailed), over 40,000 volunteers from around the world fought in Spain, and 1200 of those were the Canadians of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion. More than half of them never returned. This respectful, emotional and historically rich film is committed to the memory of those who truly believed in the cause of the Spanish Republic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kHFJ4SvuS8ZlKIVbsDUJ2UfVJsf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los Canadienses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
