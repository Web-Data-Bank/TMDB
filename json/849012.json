The coveted military information is nowhere to be found and two of the Korean spies are found murdered. Following the leads left by his unfortunate predecessors, Bai reaches the arms dealer Sha Lao Te through the courtesan Xianglan and her vast network of social connections. Without her realising it, the undercover agent Xianglan falls in love with her very antagonist, who in turn is growing increasingly fond of the fellow agent coming to his aid, Maria. Already consumed with jealousy and now perturbed by the increasing pressure from her boss Hu Lin, Xianglan lures the duo to the nightclub where they are to meet their adversaries lying in wait. But Xianglan gets cold feet and puts her life at stake to pull Bai out of danger. Pitting both his brain and his brawn against the enemy, Bai bounces back to save Maria and accomplishes his task.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lan Kwong Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The International Secret Agent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
