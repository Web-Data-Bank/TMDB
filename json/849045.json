The film creates a purely sensuous experience, a place in which the veiled and the unveiled rejoin. The stagnant waters of the Gouffre de Lantouy in the Departement Lot in Southern France form under the gaze of Isabell Spengler a theater of moving matter, in kind of a delicate iridescent explosion.” - François Bonenfant, La Cinémathèque Française, Paris, 2007","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c9wIHVB1euazlRHUdS7shyCNIwe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lantouy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
