This documentary shows the impact of that condemnation, but also looks deeper into the systemic issues that lead to addiction in the first place, including trauma and abuse, racism, and discrimination. This is a documentary about women who are deeply committed to their relationship with their children and who are also committed to recovering from their addictions. The documentary includes the wise voices of their kids who have experienced their mothers' substance use and who are so much a part of their mothers' reclaiming their hopes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":157038,"logo_path":null,"name":"SkyWorks Charitable Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recovering Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
