Inspired by Akesuk’s iconic drawing entitled Red Spider (2014), this experimental short employs the technique of stop-motion animation while making reference to the actual behaviour of the Arctic Wolf Spider, a genus of arachnid common across the North. Climate change has resulted in larger populations and increased predatory tendencies of this carnivorous and cannibalistic spider. This sci-fi influenced short animates the growing discourse around the ecological, political and cultural future of Canada’s Arctic. Background imagery was shot on location in Cape Dorset, Nunavut.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2psTpUJK44bUC9Qdoic9q3nOvh8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ice Spider","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
