On their first day there, a strange and intense attraction unites them. Together, they rent an apartment and begin living together, in close quarters. Sharing kisses and fond embraces. They exchange words of endearment with the naturalness of ordering a sandwich at a diner. They threaten to break up and the next moment they are all laughing together again. College days however soon come to an end and, with each having different paths to trail, separation is imminent. And consequently, their gestures, words and attitudes take on a new weight. Touching each other now takes on a new significance. Words of love are weighed down by consequences.","popularity":1.073,"poster_path":"/11E05W5qTGr1pZDsDnqvqCZZfKt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7765,"logo_path":"/kyZyb7enWovBqmhIZNbseIT9GZI.png","name":"TeleImage","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":78837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Sport Club","origin_country":""},{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
