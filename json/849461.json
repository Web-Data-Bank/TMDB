Conflicts broke out between those who had fought against the Germans and those who had collaborated with them and the British Army. After the military defeat of the former, the signing of the Treaty of Varkiza signaled the start of the White Terror. Houses were set on fire, people were raped, beaten, murdered, imprisoned, and exiled. All this drove the persecuted men and women to take to the mountains, where they would form the cornerstone of the Democratic Army of Greece. In this documentary, the women fighters of the Democratic Army tell their stories. Women who were persecuted, women who consciously chose to fight, women who were conscripted to the cause, together they constitute the mosaic of experience of a civil war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qzmzxCCJVtGiAcvHn4J9ZWPINAx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Collective Memory Film Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Newborn Sky: Women in the Democratic Army of Greece","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
