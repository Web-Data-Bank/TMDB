But things turn out very differently for the three young gangsters Nico, Narita and Jo. Not only is the item you are looking for in an unbreakable safe, but somehow you also kill the owner. As if that weren't enough, the trio - just one stolen car later - is also expanded into a quartet by a woman who is tied up. This is just the beginning of a twisty escape odyssey in which, despite fear and anger, there is still enough space for friendship and the luxury of idleness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fKsGrCg1ly0cWWCqzmZSGHISIlk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Girl and Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
