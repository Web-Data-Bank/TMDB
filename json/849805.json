Through this wildly funny pseudo-scientific allegory, graphic novelist turned filmmaker Richard Suicide draws us into the surreal, chaotic world of his book Chroniques du Centre-Sud, delivering a powerful portrait of a neighbourhood in the midst of a full-blown transformation. Produced by the NFB, this film is part of the Comic Strip Chronicles collection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t7onNe96YpHO5HhOrCl6U5EiznQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Centre-Sud Chronicles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
