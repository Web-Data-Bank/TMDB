One of these pieces was a silent narrative piece. 15 years later, O'Neill went back to this footage and created an entirely different film using out-takes.

Burroughs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7EVEAAwS3LQjiLMYkXVcdIoTOVB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edge Uppermost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
