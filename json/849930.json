Ruga critiques “rainbowism” and the social, political status quo that presumes a happy, harmonious family of South Africans, rather than pursues societal transformation that can address inequities and recognize the various cultures and contributions of Black queer, female citizens that South Africa comprises. Rather than grief or grievance, however, Ruga deploys camp and pageantry to retaliate against xenophobia, misogyny, and homophobia across Africa. As he observes, “humor, color, fashion, and a vivid pop sensibility have as much agency as anger, outrage, and the right to say, Fuck this!” —Kanitra Fletcher","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
