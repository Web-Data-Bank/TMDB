Isa’s younger brother is murdered and brought back to his hometown. Two weeks after the funeral, his mother Zîn dreams of giving a wedding celebration for her deceased son. This strange idea sparks off a host of contradictory feelings within her, and between her and Isa and family members, who are still reeling from the trauma and grief of losing a brother. The family gradually proceeds into a grey area in their relationship. These ordinary people find themselves living in a psychological minefield wrestling on the planes between logic, norms, emotions, and irrationality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xXm3NGwLasnJzji0fu29vuwYtbb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zerr Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2021-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dance of Ali and Zîn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
