Boggs, the U.S. Department of State’s official geographer (1927-1954). Graphic artist Boris Artzybasheff was allegedly recruited as a consultant for the effort, according to Timothy Barney, Mapping the Cold War: Cartography and the Framing of America’s International Power, 2015. Unfortunately, the creative ideas Boggs described below - using aliens and spaceships - never made it into the movie. Instead, the movie is a relatively straight-forward animated map movie with a theme of growing globalization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":157208,"logo_path":null,"name":"United States Government","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Expanding World Relationships","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
