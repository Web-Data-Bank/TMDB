Their intimately-made film This is a stained glass window (2019) draws on conceptual art and performance documentation to self-reflexively survey their then-15-year collaborative relationship, inspired by a description of the friendship between Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy as a “thinking business for and with each other”.
