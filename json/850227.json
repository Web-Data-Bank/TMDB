A revealing, deeply personal account of artist Jocelyn Tribeâ€™s life, Poleng utilises contemporary movement, Balinese dance, and archival and family photographs to delve into the complicated tangle of mixed-race identity, growing up with an absent parent and intergenerational relationships. Layered, luminous and presented with at times excruciating honesty, this dance documentary duets presence with absence in chronicling a life only half-understood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poleng","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
