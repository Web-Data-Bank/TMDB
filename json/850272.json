Set in the Jamaican countryside, Yellow Girl and Me recounts the relationship between the titular sisters and the man who provides for them; when a promise is broken, the young girl is given an early lesson on the harsh realities of life. Stark but stunningly shot, this powerful film dramatises the insidious evils of violence against women, sexual abuse and poverty while allowing for moments both luminous and almost fantastical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yellow Girl and Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
