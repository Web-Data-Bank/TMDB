It is a symbol of North America, of progress, and of nostalgia.  Reporter Stud Terkel travelled 2,000 miles across the United States by Greyhound. From Seattle to Chicago, he observes his fellow-passengers. He meets a number of travelers who appear to be very interesting people: a Native American boxer on his way to his birthplace in Montana, a bar owner who was a bank robber in a former 'career', a 99 year old woman who is still running a busy hotel, and, of course, a pedigree cowboy.  The spectator of this film listens to their personal stories, watches the beautiful scenery, and is treated to famous feature film fragments in which the Greyhound bus plays a part. Seven states and two time zones later, he is back in his cinema seat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kUeqTtYym7hKrmAF2jisdauEZXU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Westbourne Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ridin' the Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
