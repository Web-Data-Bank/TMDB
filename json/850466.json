Xiaolei and Daliao, who used wine to pour their sorrows, accidentally bought canned yellow peaches in a small shop. If there is a seemingly unsatisfactory melancholy permeated between the cups and cups, different life stories will also flow in the singing of the bar orchestra. Everything that happened this night was like a dream, with a panoramic view of the city in front of me.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/brieE8ko9gRwXGDCeXLXi1ygsJp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2018-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Night of Canned Peaches","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
