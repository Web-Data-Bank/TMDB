It evokes the different meanings of \"place\" : a location, a territory, a context, a situation, and a home. It speaks of being at your own place and being (at the place of) another, about identity and alterity, intimacy and distance, about the relationship between the \"first\" and the \"Third\". Images and sounds were recorded in Tamil Nadu. The images refer to different modes of image-making (painting, photography, film and video). They alternate from documentary\" to \"painterly images\" created through digital and analog processing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cDCb2RVKqOt0OYsQ0OB27NfkUPN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"These Are Not My Images (neither there nor here)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
