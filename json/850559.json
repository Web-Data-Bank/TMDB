Can the guillotine be stopped as their friendship turns to rivalry?  In Andrea Chénier, the poet’s fate transcends actual events, telling the story of a tragic love triangle in which the lives of the protagonists are subject to the forces of history, betrayal and amorous passion. Along the way, Umberto Giordano's music, full of elegant aristocratic dances and popular revolutionary songs, perfectly captures the atmosphere of Paris before and during the French Revolution. Winner of the 2016 International Opera Award for Young Director, Fabio Ceresa returns to the Erkel Theatre for this impressive period production.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/60AXtKpemr1xWGGiZMEBGopAmj7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andrea Chénier - HSO","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
