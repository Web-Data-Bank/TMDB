Looking back over 60 years in showbusiness, the film takes us on a journey through Tom’s career via some of his greatest songs and performances - from Delilah and It’s Not Unusual to The Green, Green Grass of Home and Kiss - many of which will have a special resonance for a Welsh audience.  Additional context to Sir Tom’s incredible longevity is provided through rarely seen archive footage and interviews with the great man himself.","popularity":0.607,"poster_path":"/az5a1gKkhwPupgztwuLZjOE8Akr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"To mark his 80th birthday, the BBC pays tribute to Welsh icon and international superstar Sir Tom Jones with an archive-based celebration spanning more than 60 years in showbusiness.","title":"Tom Jones at 80","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
