The filmmakers cleverly and entertainintly capture our attention by opening on travelogue cliches that they quickly undercut. It's not white cliffs and rolling hills they want to tell us about. It's present-day Dover - remaking itself in the crisp freshness of a postwar spring.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l2qxMJiO3ab8u6pIUjugnGyeGWt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44778,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministry of Health","origin_country":""},{"id":8598,"logo_path":null,"name":"COI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":99886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Data Film Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1947-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dover, Spring 1947","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
