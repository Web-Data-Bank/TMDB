Their truths are horrifying—a man and woman branded with hot irons and left to die. A husband killed in front of his wife and children. An elderly woman raped, another with half her face blown off from a shotgun. And they all share a common thread: revenge.  This is a disturbing documentary—it wrought both an emotional and physical toll on all involved. What’s more, Katie was detained at the airport in South Africa on the orders of the African National Congress (ANC) for her work on this project because Plaasmoorde is the story—the truth—they don’t want you to see.  We owe it to the victims—to our fellow man—to listen and to open our eyes to the truth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2018-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"State‐sanctioned murder, rape, and torture of white farmers in South Africa.","title":"Plaasmoorde: The Killing Fields","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
