Every emotion Johnson felt over the past 20 years – whether he was standing in the back of the chute at the rodeo or singing about it in front of 75,000 fans – is captured vividly in this big screen experience, with all the highs and lows that come from the dreams you cling to and the dreams you ultimately let go of.  Featuring interviews with Reba McEntire, Taya Kyle (the widow of “American Sniper” Chris Kyle), and more, this evocative and celebratory film is a love letter to everyone who has had to abandon a dream in order to find true purpose.","popularity":1.462,"poster_path":"/pmhr4QyjMmmJPuJFaCwHMnm4geP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tacklebox Films","origin_country":""},{"id":139109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trafalgar Releasing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Rodeo - The Cody Johnson Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
