In 2019, a controversial extradition bill was introduced that would allow Hongkongers to be tried in mainland China. This decision spurred massive protests, riots, and resistance against heavy-handed Chinese rule over the City-State. Award-winning director Kiwi Chow documents the events to tell the story of the movement, with both a macro view of its historical context and footage and interviews from protestors on the front lines.","popularity":4.48,"poster_path":"/6jgyeHPha11H4nbDUJsPvDU1aI0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172028,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hongkongers","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Times Didn't Choose Us, We Chose to Change the Times","title":"Revolution of Our Times","video":false,"vote_average":8.571,"vote_count":21}
