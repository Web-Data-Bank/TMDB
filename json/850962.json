He then begins a hard journey and increases in his love for God, which results in him answering the call to Evangelism. See him in his everyday life, at home, school, church, and play, as he learns the importance of being obedient and respecting his parents, teachers, and elders by facing the consequences of his actions. The underline story is a true return to core parenting by introducing our youth to the Lord at a young age. Other short cross sub-stories involve using wisdom dealing with a dreaded disease, the lack of respect for our public school educators, and the irreplaceable benefits of continuing to offer music/band programs in schools.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/3oXrVRRmBjoJLVh1006MKA7vsPy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157364,"logo_path":null,"name":"The House of John Films, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Youngest Evangelist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
