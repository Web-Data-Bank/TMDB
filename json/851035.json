Meet Charley, the portrait of a nation. At the end of the 1940s the Central Office of Information commissioned Halas and Batchelor to make seven films about policies of the post-war Labour Government. Charley was cast as the figurehead of the campaign, learning about mining, farming, national insurance, and even schooling via a son at the end of the series. This short looks at the Marshall Plan, and makes the most explicit link between character and country as his life story stands in for 270 years of British economic history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cqDNfh4umcYwRFeIi9R1rV3VPVR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Board of Trade","origin_country":""},{"id":3626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1948-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robinson Charley","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
