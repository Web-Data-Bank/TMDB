All of his patients die. Yet he has cared for thousands of patients who, in the face of death, speak of love and grace. Beyond the physical realities of dying are unseen processes that are remarkably life-affirming. These include dreams that are unlike any regular dream. Described as \"more real than real,\" these end-of-life experiences resurrect past relationships, meaningful events and themes of love and forgiveness; they restore life's meaning and mark the transition from distress to comfort and acceptance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d4LjyrQIpdZas8BHFpUudCo7FSs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tell me about your dreams","title":"Death Is But a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
