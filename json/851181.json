Over the decades, those bringing a bit of Australian sunshine and spirit to British screens have included Aussie pop pioneers The Easybeats, rock legends AC/DC, and the new sensations who became one of the nation’s most successful acts of all time, INXS.  Also featured are groundbreaking Aborigine band Yothu Yindi and a true giant of the Australian music scene, John Farnham, whose hit You’re the Voice has achieved almost national anthem status. A selection of songs from the 80s, 90s and noughties will have you singing along to Love Is in the Air, blushing to ‘I Touch Myself’ and stepping back in time with Kylie and Jason, Kylie and Nick Cave and, of course, some classic solo Kylie too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cSOHXXvxlTKEdS79wdhQ4DiFTEC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A retrospective of performances for the BBC by Australian music acts, including The Easybeats, AC/DC, INXS, Yothu Yindi, John Farnham, Nick Cave, Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue.","title":"Australian Hits at the BBC","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
