Each of her three children will get 250,000 euros if they sign a contract she’s drawn up to disown them. Will they go for it? Philipp, the youngest, desperately needs the money, as he’s lost a fortune through speculation. Rita takes a while to decide, but eventually also accepts this sudden break. The only one who vehemently resists it is Doro, the middle child; she values the family unit. While the siblings can’t handle staying with their mother and prefer to stay in a hotel, Doro’s daughter, Joe, stays with her grandmother. The two get along well. When Joe confesses to being pregnant, however, Carla straightforwardly advises the granddaughter to have an abortion. Joe is horrified. In a rash move, she takes off with some of the money — with unforeseen consequences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8zdebEiTX6KwXoIVcCWw8kxA6Zz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MuM Calls It Quits","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
