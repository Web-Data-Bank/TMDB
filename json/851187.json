From well-weathered fishermen to artists, including Leonard Fuller, who appears with a group of students in tow from his St. Ives School of Painting, to George Bradshaw who founded the St Ives' Society of Artists. And, as the narrator points out, \"there are cats everywhere\" - no doubt due to the endless scraps of fish at their disposal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":157401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moore-British Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1948-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
