A few boys drop by and the beer flows like wine. Just good, clean, fun-loving kids.  But the girls have another visitor, one they don't yet know about. Hiding in the house is a homicidal maniac who has just escaped from a mental hospital. Armed with a scalpel, the nut slashes a little here, a little there as he sneaks from room to room.  One by one the guests start disappearing. What evil lurks there? What nightmare world have they entered?
