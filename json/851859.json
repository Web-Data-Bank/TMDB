With a Polaroid in hand, he decides to leave for Berlin to find Peter, a summer love he has never forgotten. The shock of a cosmopolitan city is nothing compared to the moment he realizes that the German artist has a \"normal\" family. For him this represents the possibility of 'losing' himself and meeting Marco, who takes him around all night to arrive at dawn to the conviction that love is the only strength to find one's identity.  \"Polaroid\" is one of five short film segments in an omnibus feature titled \"A Quintet\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AtHbRqozN2eVlg7xC78rT4mdbpA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Breaking Walls Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":95000,"logo_path":null,"name":"SAP11","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2014-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polaroid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
