'Flux' delves into a human mind drowning in external chaos and inner crisis. Lost in a surreal, consumer driven world where clickbait tribalism and identity games dictate, the characters are left to vent a collective wave of simmering rage and collective turmoil. As the drum beat rises and mob war unfolds, an urgent new energy ascends as the final catharsis awaits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flux","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
