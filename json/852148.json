There's been a lot of movies about alcohol and drug addiction, but never really about gambling addiction. We see so many stories about casinos and the thrill of the win, but never about the aftermath of how it affects aspects of those gambler's lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All In","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
