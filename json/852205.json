During mating season, the strong ones take ten females each, nine males stay without a partner. This wildlife comedy observes a colony of seals and tells the story of one of them: We follow him through the crude beauty of birth, being fed by his mother, and being pushed away when the next new-born is due. His adolescent fight to define his place in life - and finally his efforts during mating season. Fresh, funny and with entertaining narration, the film switches from the sex life of seals to our own manners of courtship and mating. Isn't our life all about reproducing ourselves? What does us humans divide from mammals when it comes to love, sex and reproduction? Aren't we all seals after all...?","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":"/fnchkcKCWK3y8YaMr2qKxJbiLwx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2014-05-29","revenue":3250,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Alpha Male Guide","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
