The film is well-paced, and it leads to an exciting climax. MANEATER OF HYDRA/ISLAND OF THE DOOMED must have looked great on a massive drive-in screen back in 1967--it's still worth seeing today for the fan of 60's Euro-horror and for fans of the great Cameron Mitchell.","popularity":1.103,"poster_path":"/dyyuKMREtjxP7AcyGJXQGn5F6pZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64714,"logo_path":null,"name":"Theumer Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":21837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orbita Film S.A.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1967-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What Was the Terrifying Secret of the Vampire Tree?","title":"Island of the Doomed","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":5}
