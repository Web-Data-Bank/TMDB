Ahead of the referendum, Ellie travels to Ireland to meet activists and campaigners from both sides of the debate to try and understand the impact of the Law for young Irish voters and discovers that this incredibly divisive and emotionally charged issue is not as black and white as it seems.  She meets a young ‘No’ vote campaigner who believes he's only alive because the amendment stopped his mother from aborting him in her youth and speaks to a woman who made the tragic decision to travel to the UK to abort her much wanted daughter after discovering she would be in extreme pain for the few moments she was likely to survive.  On May 25th, Ireland voted Yes to the constitutional amendment to legalise abortion and Ellie returned to discuss the reaction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fight for Women's Bodies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
