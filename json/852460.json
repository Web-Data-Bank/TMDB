Monika and Joseph. She is a curator, he is an immigrant from Congo, a businessman with an unclear past and present. They meet during a police raid at a bar, when the first of many sparks flies between them. An understated love story, a melodrama without pathos, a fragile story about the ambiguous nature of love and the impossibility of overcoming it through reason.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/bzGxLN5X8Pz9uOoeceQVqdimt1G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1618,"logo_path":"/dacmPYkpGE9Mbu2dqG2sFTXpsqr.png","name":"Komplizen Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":178868,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZDF/Das kleine Fernsehspiel","origin_country":""},{"id":182308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media","origin_country":""},{"id":182309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmförderung Hessen","origin_country":""},{"id":182310,"logo_path":null,"name":"German Film Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":451,"logo_path":"/g1GRk1SdwxNwg5J3aXtrqTaXo8k.png","name":"Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":182311,"logo_path":null,"name":"The German Federal Film Board","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prince","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
