Feminine noun: wrath, rage, fury, indignation. Ire is the protest of women against those who oppress, despise and kill. Their eyes, tightly framed, stare at the camera: their stare is compelling. They are the masses and, from the anaphoric statement “I am”, sing out the violence suffered by women. In this film shot in four languages, Valérie Massadian uses the weight of her words and the strength of gate to build a babel call to resistance. Among these striking gazes, are the luminous eyes of a woman carrying in her womb a female child, yet to be born, but already angry.
