It is a story about a formidable and extraordinary woman, a vain eccentric, and a very sensitive human being, whose life was characterized by great ups and downs.\r The documentary takes the viewer on a journey through the author's life as described by many of those who were close to her. A journey that not only documents her extraordinary life, her extensive travels and the people she encountered-but one which also depicts the era in which she lived. A time of adventure, eccentric aristocrats, and of unending possibility and immeasurable hardship.\r Introduced by actress Meryl Streep, Karen Blixen−Out of this World tells the real story behind the inspiration for the Academy Award winning film, Out of Africa.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/3KefzVwCBisqiui79yA96FIfchR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karen Blixen: Out of This World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
