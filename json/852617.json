In this silent Super 8 triptych-projection, I documented the facade of each house on 43rd Street on 36 frames of film (center screen), while the oldest tree on the street﹘which was in my backyard﹘is shown in time-lapse over the course of several days (left and right screens). These films helped me locate myself along a continuum of time and space, relieving an anxiety of “ownership” with a sense of belonging.” (written by Tara Merenda Nelson)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4vCAWCxVghOAlp7WxgseWplbi9l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"43 street Treelapse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
