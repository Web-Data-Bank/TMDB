Snow is a chronicle of my experience struggling to understand what had happened to me and how my life had changed unexpectedly.

It was hand processed and hand-scratched.” (written by Tara Merenda Nelson)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t447pCRMjVbs5AiQ729PwOGFhKf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
