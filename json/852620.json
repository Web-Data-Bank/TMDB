This film was made during an artists' residency I had there in March 2010.  The title is taken from the book \"A Pattern Language: Towns-Buildings-Construction\" by Christopher Alexander. This book is the second in a trilogy that sets forth a structured architectural philosophy of self-designed environments.  This piece was shot on 16mm film using colored filters and single-frame exposures. The color was not manipulated in the digital edit. Each color corresponds to one of 5 notes in the Romanian B Minor scale.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sf5OqcueE4PcEJC9amUwZCYORZD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Pattern Language","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
