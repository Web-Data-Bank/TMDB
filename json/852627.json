The films are superimposed at the time of projection, and edited together during a live performance in which I use chinese fans as external shutters. By blocking the light of one projector with a fan, the image of the other shines through.  The sound is played on a small electronic Buddhist \"chant box\", which is passed through the audience during the performance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jbnk8JSCjl4yy0aZSuPmzfMYCOv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In China","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
