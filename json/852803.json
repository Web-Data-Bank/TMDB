Not only are there almost no positive role models for “big love” in popular culture, often there is actual hate.  Emma is introduced to the extraordinary Athena May, a self-styled “goddess of love”, who performs a masterclass in plus-size sex at an “erotic emporium” in east London.  Emma wonders whether the dating game is any easier for men so she chats to members of a plus-size football league to find out. Despite her self confidence, Emma admits that she still has some hang-ups about her body image so in an attempt to face her demons head-on, she quite literally bares it all.  Her journey ends in London, where she discovers the wonders of a plus-size club night - at last, an oasis in an often hostile dating jungle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"21-year-old Emma takes a no-holds-barred look into the world of plus-sized love and sex by asking questions that everyone may be curious about but are too embarrassed to ask.","title":"Too Fat For Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
