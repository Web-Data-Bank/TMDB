He later worked with JNT on various projects. Bill conducted this interview as part of the BBV dvd '30 Years of Time Travel & Beyond' produced in 1995. In the recording sequence of filming, Bill conducted this interview last in order to give John the opportunity to respond to criticisms from other contributors. The cafe where it was filmed was local to JNT in Saltdean, near Brighton where he was a regular visitor. When Bill first approached Jon about the documentary, John was initially resistant to take part, asking why he'd been left until last. However, once Bill explained the logic of 'save the best 'til last' John agreed.","popularity":0.652,"poster_path":"/mcI0DwBVVd5kHytWgQ8i2TKHS6W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88355,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBV Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Full uncut interview with the beloved TV producer.","title":"JNT: Uncut!","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
