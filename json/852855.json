This recording of Anthony Dowell's 1994 production for The Royal Ballet, with designs by Maria Björnson, features an outstanding cast led by Viviana Durante as a radiant Princess Aurora. She is partnered by Zoltán Solymosi as Prince Florimund and Anthony Dowell himself is a glitteringly elegant embodiment of evil as the wicked fairy Carabosse. The Royal Ballet, exceptional as ever, is accompanied by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, deftly conducted by Barry Wordsworth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/629GaHcZIbnMH1qrrD4GitJzOH2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sleeping Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
