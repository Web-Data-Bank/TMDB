Fearful of becoming like the lost souls who wander the abyss outside, the family keep a grasp on their past by performing sacred rituals. When Bee breaks the rules and lets an injured stranger into their midst, the family dynamic is shattered forever, as hidden truths upend the illusions the women have worked so hard to protect.","popularity":3.599,"poster_path":"/2HFLUZ0LWKDQa4xiUnjeM9ZKa0q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Local Motion Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":166910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crave Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":110624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showmax","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Oblivion is bliss.","title":"Glasshouse","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":15}
