The occupying Germans hunted these escapers who were helped and sheltered by the brave and kind Italian Contadini, farmers who put their families and homes at great risk by doing so.  Made by a crew of students in Leeds, England with very limited resources and funds, it is based on the director's great-grandfather and his experiences as an escaped British POW in Italy during WWII.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Across Frontiers","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
