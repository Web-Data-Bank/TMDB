During their aimless journey, the couple naively places their trust in a shady guy named Sylvester. Although he is a little older than the two lovers, Sylvester also tries to give some semblance of meaning to his life by becoming acquainted with the hackneyed myths of our mediatized world: road movies, war games, romantic stories, drift into drugs. By agreeing to play roles based on clichés, the trio are gradually mired in a dangerous conflict over trust and confidence, love and life.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/vqkInkLvuFQxe2A1BaoIt3iFw4v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Starmedia Home Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2002-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How do you count a life?","title":"Blackberry","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
