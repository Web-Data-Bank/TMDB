One day, Bo-chen returns home in panic to relay to her sister and her boyfriend detective Ma Tin-lung the horrifying murder of Siu-ying by her husband Tsui Kai. But a subsequent visit to the couple's, the cousin of Bo-chen's best friend Wong Kam-fung, proves the alleged crime false. Incognizant to all, the victim was Siu-ying's twin sister Kwok-ying, who bore witness to Tsui's misappropriation of their wealth for drug trafficking. Refusing to abandon the probe, Bo-chen is held up by Tsui. Deeply perturbed by Ma's investigation into his secret dealings, Tsui coerces Mei-chen to distract her boyfriend long enough for his escape. Refusing to bow to the threat, Mei-chen informs Ma who leads his squad to the rescue of the sister and arrests Tsui and his accomplices.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Am8xTOUCd3k83LeHAJ8dgFfE8Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Faan Wing Movie-Making Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Chase","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
