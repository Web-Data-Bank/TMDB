The peaceful and neighbourly existence of three families, Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish, sharing a large house, musical evenings and merriment in the city of Stanislaviv in the years preceding and post war, is shattered. First in the Soviet occupation and the persecution of the Polish family, then, by the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, and the decimation of the Jewish family. Sacrificing their lives the Ukrainian family manage to save their neighbours' children and their own daughter. Death and loss come to these families, but the healing power and joy , and a promise that the Future Will Not be Cancelled which \"Carol of the Bells' evokes will be everlasting.","popularity":1.155,"poster_path":"/ngdsAIzFGpPiXWZwjj2NzBrhbOx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190513,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMA VISION","origin_country":""},{"id":143401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stewopol","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carol of the Bells","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
