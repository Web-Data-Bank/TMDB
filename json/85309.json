This 1973 double album may well have been the peak of their collaboration. Ranging from perennial favorites like \"Candle in the Wind,\" \"Benny and the Jets,\" and the title track to more ambitious compositions like \"Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)\" and everything in between, Goodbye is unmatched in its depth and scope. This entry in the Classic Albums series of DVDs documents the often tumultuous writing and recording sessions for that masterpiece through vintage clips of the musicians in the studio and new interviews with Elton, Bernie, producer Gus Dudgeon, and the band members. We may never know how the John-Taupin team achieved their magic, but this release offers a both a peek at the process and a few reasons why the album endures today.","popularity":1.424,"poster_path":"/cCk9egU78SiADu11KfiozfKkuey.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":214,"logo_path":"/qIptM4dZBNflgv2OXzYECv8iQNH.png","name":"Eagle Vision","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic Albums - Elton John - Goodbye Yellow Brick Road","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":6}
