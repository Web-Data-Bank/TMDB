From this she created a multi-media piece based on Herman Melville's Moby Dick. In the production, Anderson emphasized Melville's writing (rambling sentences, lyrical poems, re-configured Biblical references, lapses of iambic pentameter) and narrative style (constant shifting of character voice) thereby revealing an epic tragedy worth rediscovery.
