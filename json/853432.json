An aging farmer weds a beautiful, and materialistic young bride, in a bid to save his farm from a devastating drought. Tragedy follows as the unlikely pairing struggle to untangle their growing feelings of love from their originally nefarious motives, both harboring secrets that can destroy the others' hopes and reveal their greatest fears. Set in a dry and harsh landscape, capturing the desperation and aching thirst of the land and the people that inhabit it, the story is brought to life by the delicate portrayal of uncontrolled greed and cunning, tempered by naivete and innocence, and ultimately the genuine affection that grows between the lead characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/75n46FIzxnw3oQtSaBXfknGjza0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NA","name":"Namibia"}],"release_date":"2019-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Love Letter from Namibia","title":"Hairareb","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
