In this film the found object is Man Ray’s digitized film, the first Dada film. The “original” film was digitized with all its aged emulsions, scratches, and splices, then compiled into digital filmstrips. These filmstrips are used to output a dithered and inverted image that the laser engraver may etch onto black 35mm film leader. The film images are created as the laser engraver scratches away the emulsion on the black leader.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zU6ELrp8C0Nywxh80L0vhbahTZF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Return to The Return to Reason","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
