This year he adds the Other Stage to his Glastonbury gigging history after a slot on the Pyramid Stage last year and the BBC Introducing Stage in 2011.  Bugg’s observational, toe-tapping, rock 'n' roll has been championed by BBC Introducing since he uploaded his tracks back in 2010. Following the colossal success of his self-titled debut LP he worked with legendary producer Rick Rubin on the follow up album Shangri La which hit No.3 in the official album chart in 2013. Bugg picked up the guitar at the tender age of 12, and within a year he was composing his own songs.  Inspired by Johnny Cash and Jimi Hendrix, Jake started writing after hearing Don McLean on The Simpsons and has gone on to support the Stone Roses, Michael Kiwanuka and Lana Del Rey. If last year’s Glastonbury performance is anything to go by this is one performance not to be missed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glastonbury 2014 Jake Bugg Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
