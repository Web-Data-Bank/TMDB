A closed-circuit-video projects the face of the artist and a cutout reproduction of Stefan Lochner's Madonna of the Rose Bower (1448) onto one another. The video-portrait of the 33-year-old artist practicing archery animates the icon of the holy virgin. Rosenbach shoots fifteen arrows into the face of the Madonna and simultaneously into herself. Representing the allegorical roles of women as \"mothers, housewives, prostitutes, saints, virgins, or Amazons,\" the Madonna also evokes the myth of the Greek goddess Artemis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1aiHcBa9MkN3M09Wxjj1PNacMgY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glauben Sie nicht, dass ich eine Amazone bin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
