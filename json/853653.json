Like people, chimps are fascinated by television. But until Apes as Family, no filmmaker had made a film to appeal to two ape species. This film contains all the primate dramas-around sex, food, territory, and politics. The movie follows an urban chimp into her home and what happens when she meets a bunch of wild strangers. The chimpanzees watching on televisions installed at the Edinburgh Zoo were a curious, and at times, rowdy bunch.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primate Cinema: Apes as Family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
