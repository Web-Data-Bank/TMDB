The documentary is told through a mix of characters. Among them are two survivors of police brutality who are both still suffering from the effects of their encounter with the police, and also the families of three victims who were killed, including that of a 13-year-old boy who was standing on the balcony of his parent’s home. The story revolves around the quest for justice, grief and the economic burden on the survivors who have been incapacitated and have mounting hospital bills.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/toxCLEDxBTUCkN92KAQ6y4bTe2M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"2020-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cops and Corpses: Victim's Cry for Justice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
