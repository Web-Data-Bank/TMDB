But who is he really? Why has a Lebanese communist of Christian origin been imprisoned in France for more than 35 years? Why is he considered by the Palestinians as one of their prisoners?  From the Nakba (1948) to Black September (1970) in Jordan, then the Israeli occupation of Lebanon (1982), from the Palestinian refugee camps that forged his conscience, to the international mobilization for his release, we discover the man who became one of the oldest political prisoners in Europe: Georges Adballah.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1GK8yyj7Xd8oiQhazBwDFv1Rjq7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fedayin, le combat de Georges Abdallah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
