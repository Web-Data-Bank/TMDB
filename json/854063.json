The film also explores the long journey which led to his discovery, and the appeal of Gordon's strange and wonderful music, including the testimonials of Canadian and international GT fans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yLIBI8WWIlubWKsOZTPmD9J5fan.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything's Coming My Way","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
