It has served me well over the years as I have dealt with hallucinations, delusions, panic attacks, compulsions, and bipolar depression. However, there comes a time when this coping mechanism is no longer beneficial and, in turn, hinders personal growth. Dealing with my trauma is unexplored territory for me. Experiencing an onslaught of abuse ranging from the emotional to the sexual, I’ve spent many years pushing it all down. By refusing to admit what those events truly were kept them from being real. It wasn’t until recently that my mind became ready to say it out loud and confess to myself the reality. The Decay Syndrome is not only a representation of my coping mechanisms and healing process, but a glimpse into the subtle triggers that still linger in my day to day life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wLal7t8C8ASbtBvtuFBY81d4Obg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Decay Syndrome","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
