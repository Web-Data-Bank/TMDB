Fábio Silva uses the cinematic apparatus to take us on a trip to the past, to his past, towards the reasons behind his current estrangement from his father, calling on home videos as evidence of his account. A mysterious film in which the young filmmaker risks exposing his family privacy, full of betrayal and forgiveness. It is a privilege to watch a story told with such boldness, in which the boundaries between author, audience, and family trauma are barely distinguishable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eWLWZEJJcpCOAGgoTmu0VPNWaW8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fruit of Thy Womb","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
