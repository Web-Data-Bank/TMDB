Dreamland will bring the audience to some of the most beautiful Italian UNESCO sites: Villa d’Este and Villa Adriana in Tivoli, the historic centre of Rome with the Roman Forum, the Colosseum, Piazza Navona, Castel Sant’Angelo and much more. Passing through the depths of the Tiber, it will arrive also in the most peripheral areas of the city to find out still so much beauty and so many stories about the contemporaneity in a visual and musical journey so evocative as to reveal the Italian cultural identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreamland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
