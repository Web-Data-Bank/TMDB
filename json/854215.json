Each frame of the film is a carefully photographed or painted image of a specific aspect of the area and the score is interwoven with local field recordings. All these details come together to celebrate this small overlooked village and show how immensely beautiful those unnoticed things and forgotten places are if you pay attention.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cambia tutto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
