In this unique fusion of dance and video, Streb performed on a raked platform between two large screens showing different sets of video images. Streb portrays a mythological creature in the process of evolution, moving from water to earth to sky â€” an amphibious entity in a struggle to defy gravity. Lucier's intuitive landscapes integrate with Streb's athletic choreography to create an abstract yet visceral performance space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bQGuJ2cedypCMUVwPQWLR1u2oIx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amphibian","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
