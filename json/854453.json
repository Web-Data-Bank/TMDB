A filmmaker decided to chronicle time passing, with all its beautiful simplicity. The film diary of a family, pieces of an Argentinian fiction film that wants to be completed, a tumor that dreams to be loved, two hunters looking for something to kill. The film glides between reality and fiction as the filmmaker tries to grasp the essence of his passing life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u6Y1kf3CYKGtfdHAEz8qiZS7g85.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107364,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solo Five Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":17359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nora Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2021-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Begins, Life Ends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
