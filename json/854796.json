Yumiko, a rebellious young woman from an affluent family, encounters resistance from her mother, a successful career woman, when she becomes pregnant and marries. The mother is an icy, assured presence, seen only on a television screen as a superego who monitors Yumiko's behavior. The television becomes a powerful metaphorical device, underlining the disunity of the familial structure and acting as a psychological presence. As Yumiko's marriage deteriorates, her pain is juxtaposed with the banal rituals of her mother's life (instructing her subordinates at work, scrubbing the floor at home), an irony ultimately heightened by the viewer's awareness of the reflexivity of this drama-within-a-drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6RBNSdrLSlC2K6hDm3K3EMTXTH8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1983-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great Mother (YUMIKO)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
