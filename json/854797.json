Here she presents a young female artist's conflict with the traditional, patriarchal expectations of women in Japanese culture, in which men are privileged and women are groomed to be wives and mothers. Within Idemitsu's narrative, video screens and images represent the protagonist's inner struggle — memories, conscience, familial pressure — as she subordinates and then ultimately achieves her personal and artistic desires.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pTtwDdm0tIFBW7KqiisYo3HZmMH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kae, Act Like A Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
