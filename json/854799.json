Idemitsu's signature device of using a television monitor within the domestic space works as a powerful metaphor for the ubiquity of the mother in Yoji's psychological life. Idemitsu's melodramas always articulate a double-edged irony: With no identity outside of her maternal role, Yoji's mother fastens onto her son, ultimately destroying him. Yoji himself is seen as emotionally stunted, unable to leave his mother or experience love for any other woman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ZGs9INiT095TOQKaVwxvSwkXTX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1987-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yoji, What's Wrong With You?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
