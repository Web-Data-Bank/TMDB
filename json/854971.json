A neon line grows into various symbols while a poetic text about \"borders\" glides in and out of the frame. A border is a line. It creates an incision between a past and a present, a \"here\" and \"there.\" It separates entities, a \"you\" and an \"I\". The line can also incise, the act of the cut compositing personal histories of relationship, migration, and language. The line becomes a way to trace one's trajectory and symbiosis throughout their existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bGeIRVeKDIsXRIfpR8DgEFtRIO9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neo-Neon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
