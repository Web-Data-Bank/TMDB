At the centre of this swirl is world renowned dub poet Mutabaruka, possessed of one of the most trenchant tongues in Jamaica. In this fast-paced portrait co-directed by Canadian poet Lillian Allen, he brings his wit and sharp intelligence to some of his favourite subjects-tourism, Marcus Garvey, true Rastafari, and fast food as chemical warfare. Both in performance and interview, his liberation lessons, comic asides and dubwise Rastafarian philosophy cut hard to the bone.\" - Cameron Bailey","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d0iP0F7CFIC5HBLV6MSr1GfgCNu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"JM","name":"Jamaica"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blakk wi Blak...k...k","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
