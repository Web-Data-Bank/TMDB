This brain-busting combination of alternating rounds of chess and boxing was in fact an art performance calling for more balance in a world of extremes, and the audience reaction was so electric that it inspired Rubingh to push it as a real sport.  Rubingh’s methodical ability to achieve balance in the ring is put to the test outside of it when impulsive British TV Producer Tim Woolgar takes up the sport and his opposing vision for success creates a rift between them, endangering chessboxing’s future.","popularity":0.617,"poster_path":"/uiQyJcncnSdSkTM9BmQWwDxQPkC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158145,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anonymous Pineapple","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story Of Chessboxing","title":"By Rook Or By Left Hook","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
