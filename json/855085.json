At one point, he explains his 'Jewish identity is the template thru which I understand all my other identities… how to appear to others, how we’d like to seem to others,' how others might frame themselves to be seen by us. In this way, Bordowitz gestures at what seems to be the most legible piece of this exhibition, templates for framing — each artist explores variations on the frame through presentation, history, fantasy, sculptural construction, and material.\" — Rindon Johnson","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lvChaSdBjJQLY7IOeFA87Hw9F1P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only Idiots Smile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
