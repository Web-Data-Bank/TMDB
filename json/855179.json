I longed to play with the color of film at its last gasp. I wanted to understand the relationship with the celluloid color timer (RIP) essential for the answer print. In so doing, I learned the relationship was Talmudic, at best, like going to an Ophthalmologist (in failing sight) and hoping she listens to me as I tell her which lens works better. And chemicals and performances intervene. Innocence is lost. Yet the representation of light, color, nature, shadows, and a shaky camera, persist. The seeming audacity of pure “perception” is but a moment of silent meditation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a2S0dZKG08qhiWJZpivQafg2sdD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
