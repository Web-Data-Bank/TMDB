This film is about what happened if he did ask those questions.  Between 2014 and 2017, in and around Melbourne, Australia, he conversed with a selection of 31 sonic artists, each time for 30 minutes. These conversations were edited down, each time finding a new question he wished he had of asked.  This question was used as the starting point for the next conversation with a completely different artist. This documentary film follows that process.  The conversation engages with a variety of themes, including temporality, performance, fragility, recording, artistic development, and creative process. It also offers an insight into some of the experimental sound communities operating within Melbourne, Australia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Conversational Exploration of Sonic Practice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
