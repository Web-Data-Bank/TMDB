At the same time we see a crane outside demolishing the house opposite, and the protests – which are often hand-written on the walls by the people living in the neighborhood – against property speculators and the 'renovation' which is being imposed with the violence of a mechanical digger. The camera pauses powerlessly before the equipment and the magnificent portraits in the apartment, then it moves on to look at the inhabitants of the area, the little cafés, and oblique views of Montparnasse which still retains its pleasant bohemian ambiance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Renovation!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
