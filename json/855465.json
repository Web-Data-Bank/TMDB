Nakai created a masking film with a calculated pattern of black and white frames into which he inserted positive and negative images and made a print out of two separate rolls of film. The sound consists of the electronically processed noises of insects.  “The film depicts the alchemy of light wriggling on the surface of waves, using a negative-positive flicker technique in a structure where darkness can be seen lurking behind the light.” (Tsuneo Nakai)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sjfDSueJJlo2ZrPG4NHr09eej7G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1974-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elixir","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
