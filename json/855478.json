The film is a minimalist, monochrome, hand-drawn animation. Contrary to the previous Spoken Films, it does not lend itself to easy division into parts, which are all merged here by repetitive elements of image and text (such as the vertical lines in the first scene, which later start rotating like the hands of a clock, referred to in the text of the second scene, which finally unfolds into the image of a digital clock). The music for Spoken Film was written by Dawid Szczęsny, experimental musician and turntabler, who works with Bąkowski in a duo called Niwea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hnnwSil7TI3xStA0aQiqb90cBPR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spoken Film 5","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
