Once again, Doris Chase has not merely documented the performance but transformed it into what she describes as a \"moving painting.\" Through special color video effects of feedback, de-beaming and superimposition, she creates an evocative visual interpretation of the dance. We see the dancer from different points of view simultaneously overlapped, most often contrasting close-up and full figure shots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aUlVwdKM0JUEJ315Tf1o3aXC8te.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance 7","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
