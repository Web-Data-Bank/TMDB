But also a journey through the history of Yugoslavia, a country that no longer exists. With the specific style of docudrama that he built over the years, Zilnik managed to stay engaged and brave, but above all free, by making low-budget films for decades. We follow the efforts of his team to finish the film \"Freedom or Comics\", which was seized by censorship 50 years ago, and which was recently accidentally found. The story of an uninterrupted struggle for disenfranchised social and minority groups who are constantly the main heroes of Žilnik's films.","popularity":0.824,"poster_path":"/9IkC2D1EPUuhK1tjznyGEQXdasP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84132,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arbos","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2021-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ŽŽŽ: Journal About Želimir Žilnik","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
