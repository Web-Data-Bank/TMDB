At the heart of these intersecting stories we find Sara, a single mother and novelist, who regains her will to write after witnessing the forced exile of her Christian neighbour and best friend Sabiha. With the news of Saddam Hussein's sudden execution shortly before the New Year, Sara and her neighbours brace themselves for an uncertain future. Yet, like a miracle, each is able to sustain a fragile sense of hope.","popularity":2.294,"poster_path":"/cNKbIACyHEo9pBBmnP5rwKrUWPu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Contes Modernes","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":146503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Linked Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":49622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neue Mediopolis Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":6605,"logo_path":"/6EFqFLbAefmWIwA2eCHjOjR4uR9.png","name":"Oxymoron Films","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":129866,"logo_path":"/vuqqVCAo8dyvAzjHnN9DYNddfVa.png","name":"Lightburst Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"KW","name":"Kuwait"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our River...
