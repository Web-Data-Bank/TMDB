There he is teamed with a seemingly rough old sailor/trapper, Randbæk, and a scientist, Holm. Trapped in a tiny hut together as the Arctic winter sets in, a complex and intense love/hate relationship develops between Randbæk and Larsen, who are more similar than either would like to admit. A powerful psychological and physical drama set against stunningly bleak Arctic scenery.","popularity":3.062,"poster_path":"/gt9ueOkcTt6UVZqNCH8qhgHfM8n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandrews","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":12984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norsk Film","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1995-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero Kelvin","video":false,"vote_average":6.609,"vote_count":32}
