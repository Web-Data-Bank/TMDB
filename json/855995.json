Winter is over but in a meteorological sense only. Ruins and pain. The marks of devastation in the sunny landscape. Wounds that never heal, the hesitating , vague gestures of a new beginning. Paradoxes. In black and white, with the broken images of memory imprints in color. Two words: deca and fëmijët , they mean children in Serb and Albanian. These expressions have no place in the irrational dictionary of war. It is the children though who are the most defenseless victims of this war governed by mad hatred. Their suffering has become an indelible chapter of the chronicle at the end of the century, the dawn of the new millennium. Besarta, Violeta, Edmond and Valdrin, Miljana and Jelena are Albanian and Serb children, the film tells their story in black and white with color Super 8 images shot by the children themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dFr6vR0CYcz9bZb9Q1ZnzP35X8p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63319,"logo_path":null,"name":"Engram Film Produkciós","origin_country":""},{"id":59873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magyar Televízió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2001-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deza-Femijet (Kosovo 2000)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
