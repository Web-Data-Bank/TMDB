The protagonists of this documentary tell us in Portuguese as well as in Spanish about their lives far from the bustle of the capital city. Their days are long, their work is hard, they have few opportunities to improve their situation, but they still haven't lost the ability to smile or their love of life. The aim of this documentary is to show what the process of growing old in Uruguay is like, and to raise people's awareness about the situation of the elderly. It shows, without prejudice, just what old age is.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pqiX8y4tbxxkZvA3aoLNOwI6wuT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143782,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Avventura Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":126464,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Nations","origin_country":"US"},{"id":158295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministerio de Desarrollo Social (Uy)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Growing Old Living","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
