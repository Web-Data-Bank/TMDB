Her literary work, especially her poetry, is acclaimed by critics and public alike, a rare case in the Uruguayan culture scene. With her own testimony, pictures, poems, songs and archive footage, this documentary offers an in-depth look at the essence of Idea Vilari침o's poetic universe in a frank adherence to her literary and human posture. Her childhood, her ghosts, her desolate vision of a godless world, the stormy burden of suffering from her relationship with Juan Carlos Onetti and the commitment assumed with the issues of her time define the various facets of this woman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eZp3xNMIeRBG9Fx9xbv2ud5QGC7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Im치genes (Uy)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"1997-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
