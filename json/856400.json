We see her dancing around her bedroom, lip-synching, testing outfits, in between sending heart emojis, and more, to the special boy. All dressed up, she takes a short cut through an abandoned building, on the way for her hot date. Kevin pulls up in the background on his scooter. He's Nora's recent ex, jilted and jealous. Kevin grabs Nora's phone, and what ensues is a now universal 21st century story of male-female power, sexuality and shame with a biting, feminist twist.","popularity":0.648,"poster_path":"/h5K2GaA3FSo4NzzY3w0YM4lR7jr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hi!
