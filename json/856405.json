In this place time is suspended and the severe rules of an old code (Kanun) still dictate the life and death of the inhabitants. A group of seven children obliged to live under this code meet and discuss the story of Cain and Abel. Creating their own dream space, partially consciously and partially not, they create an analogy between their own stories and Bible stories. Stuck on the fine line between reality and forgetfulness, this is one of the few chances they have to come to grips with their traumas and emotions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iQ2HpAXZLlfb7YwYybyFnZQKrtv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Margo CineÃÅma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":118377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anima Pictures","origin_country":"AL"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":75062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albanian National Center of Cinematography (QKK)","origin_country":""},{"id":17251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amnesty International","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":176951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Young Films","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sons of Cain","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
