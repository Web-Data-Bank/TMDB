Operetta per voce e piano","overview":"Everything is true: everything has happened and has been filmed as it was happening. A screenwriter at the top of his career, tired of his work and burdened by unescapable life choices, decides with an acquaintance to sail back to Rome from the small island where he spent last year's lockdown. During this journey, unexpected events overlap with a verbal outburst about his tangled life. A flow of words comes out, a naked and unabashed confession about cinema, the directors he has worked with, family, love, grief and his past. As unstoppable and digressive as a jazz solo.","popularity":0.671,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parole.
