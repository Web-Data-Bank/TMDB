A man dressed in animal skins walks next to an electric wheelchair driven by an elegant old woman with platinum blond hair. Then a gypsy woman, card players, an acrobat, two strange lovers. A couple of nuns walk by while two curious characters play the harmonica. Their dogs sing and bark.\r Curious barmen come out of the San Calisto saloon. All waiting for the big duel. Seagulls circling like vultures.\r And then the two men meet. A glance, a shot, a siren.\r And the square returns to the red zone again, as if nothing had happened.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2S8WHpWKkOp3uWHjSKP5D7b5HWd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trastwest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
