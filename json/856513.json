The newly discovered half-hour show featured a series of gag-packed routines involving stage curtains, ventriloquism and a daring sketch in which Eric eavesdrops on a newly wedded couple in the flat next door. Now, contributors including Jonathan Ross, Ben Miller and Eddie Izzard look back at this rare slice of classic comedy once again.","popularity":1.118,"poster_path":"/yUNO6G0p8Cn5mt5PYgPqGYvhACk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morecambe & Wise: The Lost Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
