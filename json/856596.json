When the tortoise found out, he called the monkey to help him carry the tree back. The monkey saw the banana and wanted to eat it very much, so he proposed to the tortoise to divide the tree, and the tortoise advised the monkey to wait for the tree to grow before dividing it. The monkey refused, and cut the tree in half with an axe, and carried away the part with the bananas. The tortoise had no choice but to move the section with the roots back and plant it. After careful management, the roots regrown the trunk soon, and a tree full of bananas was formed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cvFtWivSuUA710d82u85Rdzh7Mj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turtle and Monkey Dividing a Banana Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
