Farmers dug wells and repaired canals on the mountain to fight the drought, and left a doggerel on the mountainside: \"We don't rely on the Jade Emperor, we don't rely on the Dragon King. We are the Jade Emperor, and we are the Dragon King.\" The sun read it and read it to Wu Yun, but Wu Yun didn't think so. It was at this time that people really dug water out of the mountains and began to fight the drought. Wu Yun was very unconvinced and decided to teach these ignorant farmers a lesson.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h7URhkIxZ6Z4svLXtYJpfRWDE7U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story in the Murals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
