One editor, working alone for six months, was able to create this ‘behind-the-scenes’ documentary. The film successfully shows the magnitude of people and material necessary to mount this incredible production. The staging of this concert has been referred to as, “…possibly twice the size of any other show done in rock & roll thus far.” (meaning 1980)  Perhaps more significant. this performance would be the last for the band with all the original members who recorded the album.  In the melee of the breakup. this documentary was archived and forgotten for nearly a quarter century.  Witness now the building of “The Wall” and”The Lost Documentary”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2u3xrxYEINcJ7A6gMc37IMkRZCr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Floyd -The Wall Lost Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
