Líber Seregni, one of the founders of this political party, since 1971 fought for that possibility. For ten years he had been in prison for his ideals. His wife and family were silent observers of this long trip to build democracy. This documentary is about that day, together with Seregni's wife, daughter and grand-daughters from the moment the votes were cast up to the results that same night. The end of a journey of love, hope and trust.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r3Q8QcqY8TD43kcp5CjPCev4Zjr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fénix Films (Uy)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2004-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A day that will become history, the story of a life","title":"The Morning After","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
