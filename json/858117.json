Breakbeat, digital hardcore, and gabber all made strong efforts in the race for the bottom, but none of them holds a candle to Donk.  Combining the 150bpm madness of happy hardcore with indecipherable North English rap and then overlaying the whole mess with a single, infuriating \"donk\" sound, Donk may well be the apotheosis of all ridiculous dance music to date. It is also the only local thing going for an entire population of working-class kids with dwindling outside prospects.  We meet up with Black Out Crew, commonly referred to as the Beatles of the Donk scene. Their video \"Put a Donk On It!\" has almost 4 million views on YouTube. So come along for some ecstasy fueled all nighters into the bizarre scene that is Donk.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Donk: 150 Beats Per Minute","title":"Donk: 150 Beats Per Minute, Hardcore, Rave Music","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
