It is shot by photographer Motohashi Seiichi, known as the director of Alexei and the Spring (Alexei to Izumi) and others. Set in Senegal in West Africa, where modernization in urban areas is advancing and the Baobab trees, which used to be worshipped, are now being logged, the work closely depicts life in the humble village of Touba Toul, where people continue to lead a traditional lifestyle. It is a brilliant film subtly featuring the coexistence of mankind and nature through the modest life of Modou, a 12-year old boy who is the second son of a big family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6HvqvXB47AzKtJBkYKWi0u9DDbz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Thousand Year Song of Baobab","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
