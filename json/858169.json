She became the first living being to orbit the earth. She never returned. Her name was Laika. This inspired short begins with a catastrophe aboard an international space station that sends a lone Russian astronaut fleeing in an escape ship. Isolated and barreling through space in a half-mad state, he encounters… British Director Adam Fair has come up with a brilliant concept for a space-set horror film. One that thrills and surprises while also educating a new audience about Laika’s tragic story, tapping into energies of national guilt over her fate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kc34DkfWK6vh9k0LswSG9aL6nwB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pit Stop Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":181214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Penelope VFX","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laika","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
