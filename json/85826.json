In all-but-lost gems such as La donna nuda (1914), and Tigre reale (1916), superstars such as Lyda Borelli and Pina Menichelli portrayed heroines teetering dangerously between defiant indulgence in sexual passion and hysterical remorse at their own cruelties. Delpeut’s inventive celebration of Black Romanticism is both striking and heartbreaking in its composition—a beautifully woven narrative of tempted fate and self-torment, elegantly guided by Loek Dikker’s original score. Zeitgeist Films is proud to present Delpeut’s stunningly experimental work in all its heaving bosomed, luridly tinted glory.","popularity":0.961,"poster_path":"/A8cVlBkJrVapzquOkF2sID1ytvP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineteca del Comune di Bologna","origin_country":""},{"id":111408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmmuseum Distributie","origin_country":""},{"id":8659,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1999-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diva Dolorosa","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
