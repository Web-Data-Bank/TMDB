These dreams and his investments in them have taken him from being reasonably well off to flat broke. Akhil Bhanja (Tanay Chheda) is a 10-year-old mischievous school boy with a rather crazy streak. There is very little love lost between Mamu (maternal uncle) and Bhanja (nephew) as Rohit has been at the receiving end of many of Akhil's pranks. A crazy turn of events brings the two under one roof for two weeks. Life under Mamu's supervision is now a constant strife for Bhanja. There are a series of clashes between the two as Rohit tries to discipline Akhil but this master-of-manipulation Bhanja more often than not, gets the better of Mamu. Akhil's secret ambition to become a VJ collide with a museum trip, a diamond robbery, the Runaway Bhanja, the police and crooks on Mamu's tail - to converge in an action-packed, rib-tickling climax before the various plots resolve themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qdAFtTYcxNocaFf3iBxXeLupL1t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oye Mamu!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
