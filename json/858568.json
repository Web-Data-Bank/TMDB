For the Black scuba divers who formed the organization, Diving With a Purpose, their goal is to restore the nearly 500 voyages shipwrecked during the slave trade, to the historical record. Their mission is to uncover who was on board these vessels, and learn where they came from and where they were headed. Director Charles Todd takes viewers into this inter-generational journey, while exploring the intimate relationship between student and instructor. Todd finds both a search for identity, and a communal bond developed through a shared mission.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eTRBkUxEFKZGmc8NjBaeFDorL4f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lessons from the Water: Diving with a Purpose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
