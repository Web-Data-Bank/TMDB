The career pursuit and ordinary life heavily burden this family with the imbalance and struggle between parent-child relationship and personal value. The exhausted, impatient, and disappointed parents seem strange to their daughter. \"ufo:pm\" presents the struggle and imbalance between three ordinary family members' daily lives and their individual willingness: a daughter that doesn't fit into the behaved and polite stereotype, a mother that struggles to sacrifice her own career pursuit and compromises to the family, a father that carries the financial burden and strives to obtain success. This could not be more common in every Chinese household. The three personalities collide on a dining table.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Sf6VlmOUR7YlECGLjDJCcvALRK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ufo:pm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
