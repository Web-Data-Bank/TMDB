These opening shots outline the context in which I hope the bulk of the film will be seen: as a critique on so-called visual literacy, which is frequently based on a complacent mis-reading of images, and also as a rejection of film-biography, whose efficacy depends on such visual complacency. The body of the film consists of fragmentary views of the interior of a house, in which desultory activity occasionally takes place, sometimes in front of the camera, sometimes not. A ghost story is told, firewood is sorted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/huCYKfTUIk8hqIJDav0Q8XaFT5W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
