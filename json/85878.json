May is worried about her mother and father, whose marriage is on the rocks, and she yearns to return to the woods where her grandfather lives. One day, May befriends a boy as lonely as she is. When reality catches up, they run away to a beautiful world that belongs only to them. Both imaginatively escapist and heartbreakingly realistic, their journey speaks to kids and adults alike with the pain of solitude, the sorrow of loss, and the warmth of hope.","popularity":3.149,"poster_path":"/9DEDG5QcktqifgQwO4rW9BLWdEO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3393,"logo_path":"/5MLWHoeoDJ3MOH5KPQfVd7X1ASI.png","name":"Huayi Brothers Pictures","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":30593,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atom Cinema","origin_country":"TW"},{"id":84398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tomson Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2011-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starry Starry Night","video":false,"vote_average":6.338,"vote_count":38}
