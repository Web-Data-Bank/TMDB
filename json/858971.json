Sequences of this performative action are montaged like in a silent movie with panels of cut-up newspaper text blocks, installation shots from the Documenta exhibition inside and outside Fridericianum, and scenes from a horror porn movie based on the story of the serial killer \"Goyo\" Cárdenas – his case became a sensation on Mexican media in the 1940s and inspired several copycat murderers imitating his crimes – and underscored with a dramatic soundtrack. With Robarte el Arte, the artists satirically destabilize Documenta’s institutionalized role to chart the current art developments and thus setting the foundation for a so-called canon as Eurocentric.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robarte el arte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
