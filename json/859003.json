They realize that eleven after years of military dictatorship, Uruguay is not the same as the country they left and they missed so much. After their return from exile they find themselves in situations that seem like another kind of exile, which is perhaps in some ways more painful. They connect with what they feel deep inside, and they recognise that they share these experiences with others and have a collective history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3N9kiAoTuXVA5jO1k7hJDg1KWsp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Girasolas","origin_country":""},{"id":158676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saccofilm Zürich","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"1989-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I am From a Place that Doesn't Really Exist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
