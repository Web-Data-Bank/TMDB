Education conceived in another way: creation, freedom, expression. A film course for children organized by the Uruguayan Cinemateca. An experience that awakened vocations, or created them. Thirty years later, several referents of Uruguayan culture revive the experience that united them as children, and that forever marked a generation of creators.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kmsrJxnXUDHPesv554MIjZTE0Ix.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158682,"logo_path":null,"name":"MJ Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2015-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Niños de Cine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
