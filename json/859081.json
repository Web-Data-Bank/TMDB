What information would be retrieved, what secrets revealed? A barrage of text is generated as a laser reads bar codes and then food, objects, and the body, while the beeps of the scanner create an uncanny soundtrack. Cho employs the technology of scanning to meditate upon the process of information gathering and the construction of meaning. 67/97 is a lyrical and witty investigation of data systems, surveillance and information overload.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lx3a84buHxZopN7cUOIuP9L344N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"67/97","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
