The Town That Floored the World traces the history of that “magic material” to its origins in the mid 19th century, and tells how one town built its fortunes on its manufacture. Current and former linoleum workers, and Kirkcaldy bairns including crime writer Val McDermid, share their stories of a life in flooring. Lino’s role in high art and design is also traced. Narrated by John Sessions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2J90qjqpQ2QMltvVy9MhT70VzXO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Town That Floored the World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
