Extensive interviews with a leader of the movement to end legal abortion highlight her experiences as a woman in the anti-abortion movement and the Christian right. Lynn Estomin went to work for Planned Parenthood in Cincinnati, OH, at the same time Nancy O'Brien and her husband moved to Cincinnati and formed a militant anti-abortion organization. In the next few years, Planned Parenthood's clinic was firebombed twice, Nancy O'Brien convinced Jerry Falwell to pledge a million dollars to the local anti-abortion movement and Cincinnati became known as the national testing ground for anti-choice tactics. Years later Lynn tracked down Nancy. The result is a fascinating insider's account of the religious right and the conservative agenda for women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Side Of The Fence: Conversations With A Female Fundamentalist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
