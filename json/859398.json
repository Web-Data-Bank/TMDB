The film portrays these athletes in their daily sacrifice in order to reach Rio de Janeiro 2016. What is it like to be an Olympian in Uruguay? is the main question that this work asks, which includes essential discussion topics for high performance competition in a country depopulated of resources and interest for the so-called “minor sports”. However, this film goes beyond the anecdote and the local context to discover individual universes and universal stories of the human character.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a3gtMrZRSeNwplNs2BTFjsSat0D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2016-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olímpicos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
