This will still be an unusual tale, but it will be a bit deeper than planned. Then again, Bill Zebub usually adds deeper levels for those who want to explore.

It is more than a parody however.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n8njYNBmCv8hHJndJdHsoz3DHJV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boogers of the Antichrist","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
