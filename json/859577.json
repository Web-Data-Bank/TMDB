I was a freelance journalist at that time, witnessing this terrible event caused me a trauma. Years later, I turned these images in my archive into a documentary. I prepared this documentary by reflecting on the witness, migration and urban memory. It was very sad to take such bad footage with my camera. After these images, the Sur region was demolished, and absurd houses are now being built instead of demolished houses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tXFlp9IvIUoXl6NS4juKEsXqT4U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Long Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
