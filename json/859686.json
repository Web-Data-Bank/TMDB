The little horn. The antichrist. The beasts of prophecy written about by Daniel in his book and John of the book of Revelation. These were some of the things that interested me as a skeptical young man growing up in Chicago while contemplating atheism or Christianity.  Prophecy is one of many powerful proofs of God's existence. In this movie, we will take a biblical and historical journey through pin-point accurate prophecy that all atheists cannot possibly deny. We will journey through major prophetic events that take place from Babylon of old to America of the new world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nUspWHibG3kWeNJoYryLDJ4YTtz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Babylon to America: The Prophecy Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
