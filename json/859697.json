When the world outside was closed for everyone, Prateek and Sunanda found a new connection in the comfort of their balconies. Though the two cannot physically meet each other, they do everything from cooking together to playing games together, separately from a sweet social distance. Apart from the meet-cute story, what makes the movie even more special is that it is interactive for the viewers. You can now take the major decisions for the characters in the story and choose the way you want the story to end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balcony Buddies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
