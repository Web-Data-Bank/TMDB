The film is especially memorable since it’s missing much of the heavy socialist realism that marked Albanian doc making. Shortly after he completed the film, Karmen set off for Berlin to shoot the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":131855,"logo_path":null,"name":"Russian Central Studio of Documentary Films","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1945-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albania","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
