The source material for this video was filmed in a Korean factory and at Information Technology College in Pusan, Korea, with extensive use of macro-focus and close-up. This intense examination of the behavior of industrial machinery is well suited to the precise, exacting quality of Cho's digital editing, in which \"real\" images are multiplied, re-sized, and rhythmically sequenced. The soundtrack, composed by the artist, alternates between stretches of silence and periods of eerie noise, complimenting the elegance of this composition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xrBEqXFV8Fyk7CHxzH5nOjHdz4a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
