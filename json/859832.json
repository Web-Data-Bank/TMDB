In an effort to override the ever-shifting horizon, Cho splits the image into bands, each showing different vantages on the scene: the bluish outline of the islands, interspersed with views of the water's surface, golden in sunlight. The flickering of the bands, especially those of the water's choppy surface, is suggestive of digital static, a sense matched by Stephen Vitiello's evocative soundtrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2uiUUYAWgCDC0P8Og4zMEQAC1M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shifted Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
