The railway opened in 1907, linking the villages of Waterhouses and Hulme End, and was built mainly for agricultural traffic, with a passenger service being a secondary consideration. Its route went through beautiful countryside in Staffordshire, and it is unfortunate that the intertitles state it as being shot in Derbyshire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tIrWYw6W60y1uRyx0YkP3MmDtHn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7396,"logo_path":"/jnjLKDfdAfNylfVdybY9370Ybrg.png","name":"Pathe","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1930-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Quaint Little Railway","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
