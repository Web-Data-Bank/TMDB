It tells the story of Sister Adel, a light-hearted young nun who goes to a farming village in Ifugao to teach catechism and eventually build a schoolhouse. As she breaks the traditions of the tribe, she makes a big difference in the little lives of its people, especially that of Dacmay, a seven-year-old rowdy girl in search of her lost mother's love. At the same time, Sister Adel finally discovers her real mission in life. This is a poignant story of friendship and love that transcends age, culture, and belief. A tale that is at times comic and inevitably tragic, this is a film about being a woman, and more importantly, being human. It all begins at the time of preparing rice paddies for planting, in that season of hopes and dreams called \"haw-ang.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iGcpgJDneqBA6iPBp0QR9cs2hDy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2008-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afar","iso_639_1":"aa","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hope Begins Where Hope Begins","title":"Earth's Whisper","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
