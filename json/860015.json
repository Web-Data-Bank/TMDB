Some have been faster, stronger, younger, wiser; but now he faces a different rival. A silent and anonymous opponent who is struggling to understand.  The narrative is centred around the aftermath of a fall at the last fence of a race, where the horse (Habitare) would have passed the winning line in front had it not been for the fall. This film aims to show the lonelier, darker side to horse racing; the brave face that must be put on and not show weakness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dPyIs8EqWrJ3kpk8xYJB8nVQcwv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sky Sports","origin_country":""},{"id":158836,"logo_path":null,"name":"Equine Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The fall, the space between self and what they see.","title":"The Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
