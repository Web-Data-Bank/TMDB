Banned books and Beatles records changed hands. Albania’s Nobel-nominated novelist Ismail Kadare wrote two of his most famed masterpieces, Kështjella (The Castle) (1970) and Kronikë në gur (Chronicle in Stone) (1971) during this period. The rock'n'roll and jazz arrangements featured in this concert documentary were the pretext that brought about the end to the artistic thaw. Several performers seen in the festival were sent to prison or internal exile. The portly, smiling music conductor, Gasper Çurçia, was later accused of forging bus tickets and executed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6nVryvUH91JzIDGid0sOMI5LOpV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the 11th Festival of Song","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
