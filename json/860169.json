They share the joys of life and all the little moments that enrich their life journey together. Yet is that journey a straight road or a winding one? Could one small pebble halt the flow of this love life? What a disaster, on a beautiful Sunday morning, when disease and suffering disrupt savagely this wonderful harmony. Can a past love relation save one of today? Who, what, why -- so many questions gnawing the relation into one of doubt and resulting in anger and even hatred. Can the treason be forgiven? Will love be stronger than sorrow and detestation?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5SCbltCDC8YvyvZY9GINGXGUZzy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158857,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elephant Path Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":158858,"logo_path":null,"name":"MR-Movie Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deliverance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
