In the film, Galya walked around emblematic and famous settings in Budapest while wearing the traditional clothes of Romani women and holding a camera in her hands, taking pictures of people walking on the streets. In the five-minute short film, two kinds of material alternate: black-and-white stills, taken by Galya herself, and moving images in colour, made by her supporting team. In the former images we see strangers facing Galyaâ€™s camera, while in the latter, Galya herself is the protagonist as a flaneur who walks on the streets: contemplating, taking pictures and sometimes talking with people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Romedia Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2014-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pages of My Book","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
