This revelatory film hears from the people who experienced the riots up close and personal. A decade on, we look back at the summer of 2011 through the eyes of those whose lives have never been the same since.  In a series of candid interviews, we hear the story from all angles. Convicted rioters, frontline police, a judge, a government advisor and a grieving father look back at that week in August, and the years that followed, to piece together what really happened and why.","popularity":1.438,"poster_path":"/mXelFmL65Kro8ZtpY4m1T0RGFsA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107763,"logo_path":"/eLqEwxftRksydIt1F5h5BdqjMq0.png","name":"Top Hat Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Riots 2011: One Week in August","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
