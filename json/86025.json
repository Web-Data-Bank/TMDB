Spinks won the world heavyweight title in only his eighth fight, the fastest ascent in history. An aging Ali had expected and wanted an easy fight, but he was out-hustled by Spinks, who did not seem to tire throughout the bout. It was one of the few occasions when Ali had left with a bruised and puffy face. Spinks victory over Ali was to be the peak of his career. Spinks became the only man to ever take a title belt from Muhammad Ali in the ring (Ali's other four losses were non-title contests). Spinks' iconic gap-toothed grin was featured on the cover of the February 19, 1978 issue of Sports Illustrated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spinks vs. Ali I","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
