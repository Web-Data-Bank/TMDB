Loyan's ambition is to get into detective training, but his supervisor Jokisalo  thinks he'd be better off patrolling the familiar neighbourhoods with his partner Johanna. The patrol gets down to business when they start investigating what looks like a suicide. Antero Päiviö, a professional criminal and racial bigot involved in drug trafficking, has jumped from his balcony. The man who was first pronounced dead suddenly wakes up and is taken to hospital. Loyan finds it hard to believe the man's story and decides to find out the truth at any cost. As the plot unravels, it's hard to know who to trust anymore, when Warsame seems to be up to something behind Loyan's back.","popularity":0.706,"poster_path":"/5yA9SydbcSVXBgjgOuPCCR87yjT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33389,"logo_path":"/u3M4P96gbfON4lKiJVruOnhreFh.png","name":"Inland Film Company","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hyväveli","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
