Young, scrappy concert promoter John Brower puts his life on the line to turn his failing Toronto Rock n Roll Revival into a one-day event, later coined in rock mythology as “the second most important event in rock n’ roll history.” And it almost didn't happen. The festival united rock legends and the almost famous, but it was the 11th hour arrival of John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band that ignited a truly seminal moment for the 20,000 fans at Toronto’s Varsity Stadium, triggering Lennon's final decision to leave the Beatles forever.","popularity":0.644,"poster_path":"/pdfYZa8yA4m7lDFNUYTQiytFXkc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chapman Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":195639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films à Cinq","origin_country":""},{"id":24487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pennebaker Hegedus Films, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revival69: The Concert That Rocked the World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
