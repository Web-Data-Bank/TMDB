Instead, its legacy is memorialized through a compelling point-of-view historical Canadian documentary. From 1971 - 1977, MIDIAN FARM was a back-to-the-land social experiment created by a community of urban baby boomers from Toronto. Part of the youth counterculture movement during a period of social and political re-imagining, its utopian vision eventually collapsed. More than four decades later, filmmaker Liz Marshall unearths a transformative piece of family and Canadian history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qLB5U2Qc1hsK1Zy9FL8W2i48vZu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158906,"logo_path":null,"name":"LizMars Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midian Farm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
