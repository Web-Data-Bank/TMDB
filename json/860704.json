In more than 15 apparitions, Kerbaj delves in activities as varied as sleeping, talking, praying, playing, or fighting, sometimes alone and sometimes with himself. The result is an accurate yet amusing self-portrait, exploring both the unique music practice of the artist and his humoristic approach to megalomania.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fmYYnmnZkExJoGpFXxkVCtAFWjM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mazen Kerbaj – The Musical","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
