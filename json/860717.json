He was a politician from an Irish-Australian working class background who lived by principles of compassion and concern for his fellow Australians. His philosophy and example have never been more relevant than in the political arena of today. As Prime Minister and Treasurer, he had a profound effect on the path of Australian history following World War Two, and many advantages enjoyed in our society that we take for granted today are the product of his vision.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":131008,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ronin Film Production","origin_country":""},{"id":16577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ronin Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chifleys of Busby Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
