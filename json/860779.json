Halil keeps on with father's work, to pay for his younger brother and their old mother food and shelter in a slum. Then, the horse that pulled the chariot dies, and Khalil goes on, taking the animal's place. A rich man tries to kill another, and pays Halil to pick up the revolver, and take the blame - going to prison instead of him. Halil accepts, and takes the money to his mother. In prison, Halil grows up as a rowdy man. Later, fate will bring the two brothers together, but in opposite sides of the law: Halil is a paid assassin, and his brother is a public prosecutor. When the Mafia pays Halil to kill his own brother, he refuses - and the Mafia retaliates by killing his wife. Halil vows to revenge her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cJt2BjlyNTuFUKfcFLNb5nJIDkW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gülgen Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1979-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"İnsanları Seveceksin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
