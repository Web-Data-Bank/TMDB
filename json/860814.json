Mixing a localized focus on Ireland with insights from scientists and leaders from around the world, the film serves as both a primer on climate science and a penetrating analysis of media framing and the science of perception management. An excellent resource for courses in science, environmental studies, global politics, and media.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r4jYHI0h2E2iNI1OdyS7uAaEZke.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Education Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Propaganda & the Denial of Climate Change","title":"A Burning Question","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
