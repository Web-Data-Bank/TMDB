Nixon himself established the reference between the two events: “We came in peace for all mankind” not only marked the lunar module Eagle’s landing spot – Nixon also spoke of it into the microphones just before his departure to China. It was not John Adam’s aim to create a superficial or even a caricaturing representation of Nixon’s visit when composing his opera. He attempted to create a “heroic opera” about the construction of modern myths by using archetypical characters and situations. Director Marco Štorman stages Adams’ minimal music opera as a deconstruction review about the power of images, the politics of staging and the staging of politics.","popularity":0.662,"poster_path":"/jZdrFrzi1PFYN2dDbaCWnOE8oET.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Staatsoper Stuttgart","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":162,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live recording from the Stuttgart State Opera","title":"John Adams: Nixon in China","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
