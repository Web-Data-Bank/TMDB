However, that doesn’t mean that there wouldn’t be any performances at all, and instead organisers Michael and Emily Eavis organised a virtual event from the site in Pilton, Somerset.  Filmed across Worthy Farm including at iconic locations such as the Pyramid Field and the Stone Circle, the livestream took place in May 2021 and supported Glastonbury’s three main charitable partners Oxfam, Greenpeace and WaterAid, as well as helping to secure the festival’s return in 2022.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pyMqhBsXRvXgU8bOw0uosepiH3A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104151,"logo_path":"/tEMOnfOGQsTacV6dbrLsbc4F7yn.png","name":"BBC Music","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HAIM at Glastonbury 2021","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
