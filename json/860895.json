The theatricality is reminiscent of both Beyoncé’s Homecoming Coachella appearance and David Byrne’s acclaimed American Utopia shows, but the rapper’s very particular charisma imprints his own identity on the show. It’s packed with pulse-quickening moments – the interplay between Kano and guest stars D Double E and Ghetts on Class of Deja; a sudden plunge into total darkness while what sounds like a 999 call reporting a stabbing plays in the middle of Trouble; the appearance of a choir, who, among other things, are required to sing “suck your mum, suck your mum” during SYM.
