Families are desperate, the men are broken, albeit victorious. Padre Pio also arrives, at a remote Capuchin monastery, to begin his ministry, evoking an aura of charisma, saintliness and epic visions of Jesus, Mary and the Devil himself. The eve of the first free elections in Italy sets the stage for a massacre with a metaphorical dimension: an apocalyptic event that changes the course of history.","popularity":6.567,"poster_path":"/n7XHCnuOPSHsuOIz5DRnTvJxiee.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24656,"logo_path":"/7vmW501iy7QBateXgBm5j48U5PX.png","name":"Interlinea Films","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":112609,"logo_path":"/9lpuWYlMInFARjrNUhVAzBW2YzT.png","name":"Maze Pictures","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":139679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rimsky Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":171436,"logo_path":"/2PCuIrmhOMX9eGpxs8PQWjxfU3s.png","name":"Carte Blanche","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Padre Pio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
