Bolstered by the continued emergence of Academy graduates and the returning Romelu Lukaku, Chelsea were a permanent fixture in the Premier League's top four. In the first of the three finals decided by penalty shoot-outs, the UEFA Super Cup was secured in Belfast while Kai Havertz was again the hero as the Blues captured the FIFA Club World Cup. Further silverware was so close, but Chelsea were twice denied by Liverpool. First, in a dramatic 21-goal shoot-out in the final of the Carabao Cup and then agonisingly again in the FA Cup Final. As the Roman Abramovich era at Stamford Bridge came to an end it was still a season of success, but also one of what could have been, although the Blues proved once again we are among the very best.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ye8oSjrzKned2eP4JPlWJsr0i1P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93472,"logo_path":null,"name":"PDI Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A season like no other, filled with tension and drama, both on and off the pitch","title":"Chelsea FC - Season Review 2021/22","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
