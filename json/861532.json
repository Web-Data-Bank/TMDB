He’s also oblivious of his friend’s growing affection for him mostly because he spends his time pursuing shy, but hardworking student Gina (Sidra Lorenzo). Gina only wants to finish her studies so she could provide a better life for her impoverished family in the province. But Mico persists, even promising the moon, the sun and the nearest galaxy of Ursa Minor (though I would suggest he should start by looking for a job first). She initially brushes him off until the inevitable happens. She falls for the gentleman’s eccentric swagger (he walks like a newly circumcised guy, I kid you not). Besides, what girl wouldn’t gravitate towards a guy who, on their first meeting – while she walks home from school – asks her, “Kailan mo ba ako sasagutin?” He isn’t in a hurry, is he?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m4PecNX5evyy3ZVYD2utRuxmfXS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kapalit ng Ligaya","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
