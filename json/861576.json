Smiling like a kid, he blows out his birthday cake candles, followed by applause. An hour and half later, he is eighty-five years old. Between these two milestone birthdays, the film directors followed in the day to day footsteps of this smiling, debonair giant; for whom the expression, \"quiet strength\" seems to have been coined. Composer, musician, journalist, an ambassador of the Francophone world, honoured and distinguished around the world; Manu Dibango has remained himself wherever he may find himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wGOK1KNMJjMPpw8OsHJhOTHNfgT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tonton Manu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
