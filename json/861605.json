He then turns his attention to the always shifting terrain of race and identity in the United States and Britain, offering fascinating cultural and political insights into the presidency of Barack Obama and the 2012 Olympics in London. While Hall was physically ill for much of his later life, this final interview provides powerful testimony that his formidable intellect, sense of humor, and willingness to engage with the gritty realities of politics and power never deserted him. An absolutely essential resource for anyone interested in cultural studies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AidK01FdkjkJrqTLgH7gNhKqQb1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Interview: Stuart Hall on the Politics of Cultural Studies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
