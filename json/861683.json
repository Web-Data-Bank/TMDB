This is a story about today and 6 characters who are still experiencing the impact of our colonial history, in cities that have only just begun to speak about their complex past. Throughout the film, these characters are met with denial, reluctance, avoidance, ignorance and ultimately silence, as they figure out how to be seen and heard in a system that was never built for them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yawUqpRggKvQYkAMc1TEh6Sxm9c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Elephant in the Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
