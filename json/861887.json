The players are a dozen fourth grade girls (9 to 10 years old) whose well-developed repertoire had been earlier brought to my attention by a sympathetic teacher… The actual film was taken in a playground area which had been reserved for us for the morning so as to minimize the number of spectators. We used two 16mm cameras, one in fixed position and one hand-held; sound was recorded via an overhead boom mic. The children had had the location of the mic pointed out to them and for the entire morning they centered themselves without direction under the mic with almost professional aplomb. All action in the film was undirected, for it turned out that the children needed no direction. They had come to play, and play is what they did, whether the cameras were loaded or not.” - BLH","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/axyPwkhxVkvC6QTFzxy5ocCBwyg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pizza Pizza Daddy-O","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
