White mercenaries with war experience are also involved in the conflicts. They include Germans who, under the leadership of the former Wehrmacht officer Siegfried M端ller, brutally attack the black population. After the \"Stern\" reporter Gerd Heidemann had uncovered the machinations, the GDR filmmaker Walter Heynowski made a politically motivated documentary about Siegfried \"Kongo M端ller\". Now Siegfried Ressel has reconstructed the story of the German mercenaries and the propaganda argument about their use.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/azqwESLVvi0FbCVMQWEvXAbxrif.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159162,"logo_path":null,"name":"a+r film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kongo-M端ller: A German-German story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
