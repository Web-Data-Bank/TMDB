During this night at the museum, she wanders from room to room and films the enigmatic creatures she encounters - animals, works, but also the artists and accomplices she has invited. These successive apparitions compose the scenes of a surrealist film that spectators can discover in a giant projection on the façade of the museum during an exceptional evening.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5rTHd2dOnuz6s5z0uskWx8eranN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taxidermize Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
