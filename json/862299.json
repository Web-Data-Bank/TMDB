At Ivan’s door the bell is rung by a scared stranger who asks “to sit it out for a while”, explaining that she went by a rally and “accidentally” got her share. Vanya lets her in. But at the door an OMON officer turns up, who is looking for the most active protesters. Vanya opens: he has nothing to hide, especially since he hates these “morons shouting outside his window”. To get away, the beauty plays a whole performance before the OMON, involving Vanya; it becomes clear that she is not what she pretended to be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bpVuPaRkXyM0TmSHwoPFF5310Gm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Studio Heirs","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Different Sides","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
