Bishop Jesse has some concerns about Elder Star, so he summons Elder Daniels to question him about his friend; Daniels is happy to answer all of Jesse's questions and agrees that together they should confront Star about his failings. Jesse knows that some of the Bishops are prone to exaggeration when it comes to the talents of the Elders, but the story's about Start intrigue him so much that he finds himself driven by his curiosity to discern fact from fiction. Perfection in both mind and body is a goal for the Elders of the Order, and Jesse sees the desire to reach these goals in Young Mason. His obedient and nurturing nature are qualities Jesse believes all the elders should have.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uzHnhbEZBibMzc3NIUfC3gCh5QR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Missionary Boyz","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bishop Jesse: Chapters 1-4","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
