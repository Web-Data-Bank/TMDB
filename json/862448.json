But because she was careful not to be at the centre, these autobiographical traces may now become the starting point for fiction, for self-fiction. Peripheral heroine. But what to place in the centre? The blackness of passing time, the night that we fear to enter all too soon, which devours friends and lovers, all our life stories. From the rushes amassed over the years, Muriel Montini extracts fragments of memories, drawing, around the obscure centre, the constellation of time lost and found.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm a Heroine of the Peripheral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
