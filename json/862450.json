Local people talk about their experiences, an escapologist performs and a drag act sings. Plus drama sequence in which Bill tells Rose that making a fortune is easy.” - BFI.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28323,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Film Institute Production Board","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1988-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Dog Bites","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
