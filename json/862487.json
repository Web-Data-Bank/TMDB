The story evolves around a man, in his late 40ies, who takes off for a walk away from the daily struggle with work, family and thoughts, only to find out that you can walk away from your problems, but that you cannot walk away from yourself. This journey of a man, on a road to nowhere, is dramatic, funny and very recognizable especially when you lost track or when you are on a dead-end yourself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alles in de Hens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
