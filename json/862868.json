Joe D'Amato sulla via dell'eccesso","overview":"Who was Joe D’amato- Aristide Massaccesi under his civil status? A genius of horror in the USA, a master of eroticism in France, the king of porn in Italy. A man with a thousand pseudonyms capable of making over 200 films while simultaneously holding the roles of producer, director, author, director of photography and even camera operator. An artisan of cinema as he liked to call himself, capable of working on all film genres. From spaghetti western to post-atomic, decamerotic to glossy eroticism, and blockbuster porn to bloody horror. Guided by the aesthetics of extremes and supported by an undeniable technical ability, Joe D’Amato pushed himself, and the viewer, beyond all limits following with dedication three rigid principles that have become his stylistic code: Amaze, Shock, Scandalize.","popularity":1.629,"poster_path":"/qcOO73D1DPw0FrGCwKmAsUfj2Mk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fairway Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":159730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trullove","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":134171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wave Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":5125,"logo_path":"/t3oWTsVukmEzrZzvfr37XRBibo5.png","name":"Le Pacte","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inferno Rosso: Joe D'Amato on the Road of Excess","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
