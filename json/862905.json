Soon they are married and even sooner they have a baby on the way. At just 18, the smitten couple had considered only romance, but now Alisher finds himself struggling to provide for his young family in the harsh economic climate of Osh. The only option left for Alisher, like so many of his generation, is to leave his new bride to try to make it big in Moscow. While the earnest love between the newlyweds has a sweetness stronger than their 3,500 mile divide, their relationship is now beset by challenges more dire than distance alone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kcfcwd4gZ55y5KU5oarmCb6kvbB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17518,"logo_path":"/1gPGo3B6BAFYSRQ3X6NumB3nGMU.png","name":"Auto Images","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Distance Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
