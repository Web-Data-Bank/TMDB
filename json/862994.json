On top of that deep mountain, Simon Piggott, 70, who moved from England 30 years ago, and his family live. As such, Oshikamura is a place that warmly welcomes newcomers and pursues a quiet, slow life where people help each other. However, since the start of the \"Linear Shinkansen Project\" for tunneling through the Minami Alps five years ago, many changes began to occur in Oshikamura. This film slowly observes these changes in Oshikamura.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eLqO4e1GVcTTK2rO4gDlvnfDf2I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oshika - Winds of Change","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
