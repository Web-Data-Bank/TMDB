It sits in a lush valley amidst a forest of trees, far from any city lights, with beaches a short drive away. The owners, Gus and Sarah, built this home out of as many recycled and found materials as possible, including tires, seashells, and glass bottles. Knowing it would take a great deal of labor to complete a project of this scale, they turned their build into an Earthship-building workshop. They invited interested parties from around the country to come and stay with them and construct the home as a group learning experience. This is the documentary of the building of the first Coromandel Earthship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/WKuThhK8vtlOhfAwggtr9QqnSv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Healthy Homes - Te Timatanga Earthship New Zealand - Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
