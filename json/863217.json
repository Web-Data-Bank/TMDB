See what it took to ensure the future of the Friendly Confines was secure for the next 100 years. \"Saving Wrigley Field\" details the multi-year journey to preserve the magic of this beloved ballpark.  Wrigley Field has played an important role in the development of professional baseball and has been the site of numerous baseball milestones, including Babe Ruth’s supposed “called shot” in the 1932 World Series, Gabby Hartnett’s “homer in the gloamin’,” Ernie Banks’ 500th career home run and Kerry Wood’s 20-strikeout game. Wrigley Field is the only Major League Baseball (MLB) ballpark still standing in which Jackie Robinson played and, in May 1943, it was the site of the final tryouts and organization of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the first major women's professional sports league in the United States.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/99Ln3hyta7MdyRUxiQWCriJhEmZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saving Wrigley Field","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
