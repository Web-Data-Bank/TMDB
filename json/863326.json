In a remote area of ​​the provincial town, there is an unremarkable old embankment. It was built in Soviet times. At first glance, it may seem that nothing has been happening here for a long time. But observing the same place from the same survey points throughout the year, important changes are discovered, associated not only with natural phenomena, but also with people coming to the embankment.
