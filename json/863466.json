While they wait for him, they receive a call from El Negro who has had a fight in a hostel with his ex-partner, Mariana. The friends go to the place and manage to transfer Mariana, who has lost consciousness, to the meeting place. They play games and make drinks while they wait for him to recover. But this does not happen and they will soon find themselves in the alternative of having to get rid of a body that has become apparent evidence of a crime. During the long night the ghosts of sexism, frustration and imposture so characteristic in certain social sectors of our culture will appear.","popularity":0.854,"poster_path":"/v0s4Vp00I4uNu9SFSEFr6holurn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52049,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inca Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":38918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laguna Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2008-11-13","revenue":37771,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un cuerpo desnudo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
