It seems that Lee disavowed the existence of God when his beloved sister was stricken with blindness. Judson's daughter Ruth (Jane Grey) does her best to convert Lee, but it's a losing battle. Even worse, a series of bizarre coincidences leads the villagers to conclude (wrongly) that Lee has tried to \"have his way\" with the virginal Ruth. On the verge of being lynched by the angry townsfolk, Lee is saved by a timely bolt of lightning -- whereupon he embraces that Old Time Religion in a real hurry. Cast as Ruth's ne'er-do-well brother Tom is diminutive Percy Helton, best known to latter-day film buffs for his raspy-voiced character roles in such talkies as The Robe, Kiss Me Deadly and The Music Man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gbsQQzDVct7ZvZKVoa26pHoQKlO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Superb Pictures Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flower of Faith","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
