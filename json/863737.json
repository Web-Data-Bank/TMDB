One day, he takes a nap in the park and has a dream. It is a world where the time axis is out of whack. He walks, he runs, he pedals his bicycle... But the movement of the people is not constant, it flows, it breaks, it starts from the middle. It was a scene of strangeness and unprecedented beauty as if not only the time axis but even the spatial axis was bent. Eventually, the man woke up from his sleep and began to walk, but his body had changed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pE2sG8niJuOqoiOGaLviO0qAa1X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"R","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
