The day slowly says goodbye to the night - but still defends itself a little. Steph enters Rick's boxing stall in Berlin-Wedding. She is insecure, wild, frustrated - and yet determined. She craves recognition. Through rick. The gym operator, former heavyweight boxer from Boston. It was equipped with everything a champ needs. And is now broken. Seriously injured, worn down, disaffected, sick early on. She can do a lot, but not really. He can't do much anymore, but he realizes all the more. Above all, their energy, their will, their talent. That night, two soul mates are found. Without them knowing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q3Y2Hk9UFDFdDamsACawgwJannd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162203,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hello Moment Productions GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leberhaken","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":3}
