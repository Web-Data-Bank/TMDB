However, due to the village destruction policy of Ceaucescu, the inhabitants were expropriated in 1989 and the village was overrun. 25 years after the evacuation, they meet again on the edge of the lake. The survivors organize a memorial moment, in a vain attempt to pass on the special values of their complex but beautiful society to the next generations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pjQIpIK2jLWPUw6dtLEv9fOWEPS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12344,"logo_path":"/wv09Wlvk6Kjy8ijMpRTHLPXyCrf.png","name":"Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":127010,"logo_path":"/bcYYHmYOGCnsB9ydnIHnndYcExd.png","name":"Nederlands Filmfonds","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2014-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beneath the Surface","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
