The story of the film is a result of the Mayor’s wish to have his Island enter aviation history, and the impotence of the chosen “flyer”, who in his blind passion for flying doesn’t even notice his wife’s affair with the mailman or the conspiracy of the village big shots, who are ready to sacrifice their neighbour for the dubious distinction of being written of as the first self powered aviator. The church bell, the stake for a successful flight, ends up on the “flyers” yard since the pilot has kept his word :”I will fly. I will rise, glide through the air, or I’ll never walk the ground again.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":159492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Multimedia","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":159493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sfinga","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":4300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viba Film","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flying Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
