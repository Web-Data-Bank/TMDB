Haraway, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Greg Egan, the work plunges us into a speculative future, where samples of then extinct plant species are preserved and displayed in a virtual archive room. Through editing and visual strategies, this archive room is sporadically transformed under the effect of interference caused by the memory emanating from the listed plants, revealing traces of a past that continues to haunt the place. Floralia is a simulation of ecosystems born from the fusion of technology and organic matter, where past and future coexist in a perpetual tension of the present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A56oxl6vXku1kJE0jFnlJc6W7yD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FLORALIA II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
