But Olga and Igor are not like that. They are honestly engaged with children on the slide, play, freeze, but fulfill their duty. Although, to be honest, they are a little bored. And they willy-nilly begin to look at each other, gradually drawing in their heads each their own image of the other. They already really want to start communicating, but upbringing, stereotypes and a story invented by everyone about a vis-a-vis prevents them from taking the first step. It already saddens them, because they really liked each other. Suddenly, children loudly reveal family secrets.

And both of them are free.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7ejW87fQEstwy37OsiRa8BVcBxP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moskovskaya Gorka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
