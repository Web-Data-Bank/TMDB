Наваждение","overview":"Viktor Tikhomirov made the only female portrait film about the virtuoso pianist Polina Osetinskaya. She started playing the piano at the age of five, and at six she already gave her first solo concert at the Vilnius Philharmonic. Every day, the young pianist rehearsed for 14-16 hours, taught 10 poems and ran 10 kilometers. In the film, she talks about her childhood, strict discipline and vivid images that she came up with to visualize music. The film uses recordings from the pianist's personal archive, footage from Yevgeny Yufit's film \"Killed by Lightning\" and video chronicles of the 1980s — the first interviews of the Ossetian.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polina Osetinskaya.
