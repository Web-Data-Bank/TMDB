In this film, artists such as Martin Scorsese, Julian Schnabel, Chuck Close, and the late Robert Rauschenberg reveal how Picasso and Braque's shared love of film helped to create some of the greatest art of the 20th Century. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","popularity":0.922,"poster_path":"/vp3OsILVbx2xQ8uXzJhDlqIflJx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A movie about Picasso, Braque, cubism & early cinema","title":"Picasso and Braque Go to the Movies","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":7}
