Our documentary film shows two main characters, Demitrius and Niaja, who experienced racial profiling as young teenagers. Demitrius was followed, stopped and searched based on what he was wearing. While this experience affected Demitriusâ€™ identity--how he dresses, walks and presents himself it also made him curious about black history and the roots of racial profiling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2cv5IGnppj70olgZgVQFXPZndM9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cops Are(n't) Colorblind: Changing the NYPD from the Inside and Out","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
