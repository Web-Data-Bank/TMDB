After her father's death that took a toll on the family's income, teenage Anjani struggles to regain control as her mother tries to sell the house, which doubled as her father's puppetry studio. Little did she know that he has been teaching her the ways of a shadow puppeteer in private, as women are not allowed to practice it. When she returns to the puppets, Anjani is able to reconvene with her father's spirit, learning one final lesson through the artform before she sets out to realize her own future - becoming a modern Srikandi.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zz5CyMITR6qtJUWlRBFjGtuReIE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pandapix Enterprise","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Srikandi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
