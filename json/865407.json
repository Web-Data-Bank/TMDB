With clarity and courage, the women in this film reveal the hidden face of that so-called \"sex work\". They are 22, 34 or 48 years old; they live in Montreal, Quebec and Ottawa - They have recently given up prostitution, or are trying to escape it. These women are leading the bitter fight to turn their lives around and it is a long and lonely struggle fraught with difficulties. Shot in a Cinéma Vérité style, The Fallacy (L'imposture) takes us to the heart of their realities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/weYXU85Hfj1T1yjwHoPBzwiNefz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions du Rapide-Blanc","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fallacy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
