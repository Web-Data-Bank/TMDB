It is practiced for a variety of reasons or beliefs, be it religion or health.  Circumcision is one of the most important events after the holy day, every year in Sitio Igbarawan. This is the opportunity that young people (and a few adults) look forward to but miss but it is also a big step so that they can be called fully young. Kadoy, 9, has no idea that he will be circumcised this year. Fear still prevailed over him but one incident embarrassed and lowered his self -esteem. This is what pushed him to face this great test of his manhood.  Will he be able to withstand this test? Will he be able to regain his low self -esteem and that of the girl he loves?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kjlSrAh04fVfZyVLmyLS23z1hGg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filipino Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":57619,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Commission for Culture and the Arts","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":159770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Negros Cultural Foundation, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2021-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tender Leaves of Guava","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
