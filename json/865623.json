Many of the once glorious clubs which dominated German soccer until the 1970s faded into obscurity without financial backers.\r The documentary “Im Westen ging die Sonne auf\" (\"The sun had risen in the west“) shows the history of the “Revierfußball” from after the second World War until the decline of the mining industry and recalls legendary players and forgotten clubs. The film shows especially how deeply rooted the sport was back then in the entire lifestyle of the Ruhr area - in private life as well as in society - and how structural change also left clearly visible marks in sports.  With pictures from back then, interviews with contemporary witnesses, and footage of original locations nowadays, a contemporary document of German post-war history, by taking the example of soccer, has been created.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/exzHJHAuCCaGli5uxqTAxaTNBbw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8677,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGS Film","origin_country":""},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Multimedia Film und Fernseh","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":315,"logo_path":"/hdu0sVxgtCuQud0xF8ZBiN7hEhY.png","name":"Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Westen ging die Sonne auf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
