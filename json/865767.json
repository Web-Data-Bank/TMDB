Things don’t begin well, however, when she looks for an extracurricular club to join and proceeds to immediately ding a glider at aviation club tryouts ending up having to work it off. She is initially disillusioned with campus life. Then Kuramochi, the club leader and glider pilot, takes Tamaki under his wing, and from the moment he takes her up for a flight in a glider, Tamaki becomes a captive of the vast beauty of the skies.","popularity":6.485,"poster_path":"/xUIX9FA9t4S2SgnPpTcGp9LH3Uz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20868,"logo_path":"/jhJGtYghSVawQJygEnJymQAqAb2.png","name":"Telecom Animation Film","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Thermal","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":12}
