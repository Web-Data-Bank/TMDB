An indignant Kong joins hands with fellow worker Chow Mei-ha and factory head Wong Chi-kong to expel Blackie Kei whose ruthless and blatant exploitation of the workers has been going unpunished. Facing the loss of a lucrative source of income, Blackie and his underworld bigwig boss Wu Tin-hung intercept the love letters exchanged between Wong and the wife of the general manager Ting Yuk-lan and use the correspondence to extort money from the adulterers.
