It is by far the most important religious event in the Shia cult, and leads to the formation of immense mass movements all around the world.  Mystic Mass describes extensively this 24h ceremony, and deconstructs its indivisible, ever united, mystic mass, since its formation early in the morning of Ashoura, up to its dissolution in the afternoon of the same day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wBpmIdCpcOAM98gSb7xYuxx3sIy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73017,"logo_path":"/8Mqi46hTurhP1elDa6EsgH6S9oh.png","name":"Némésis Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mystic Mass","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
