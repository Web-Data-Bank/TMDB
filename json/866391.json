Acclaimed director Patrick Jeudy has access to a series of conversations recorded a few months after her husband’s assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  The Lady in Pink was continually driven by a dual purpose: that of molding her own image, whilst managing that of the president. She cannot change the past, so she may as well rewrite it and start to build the legend of JFK.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oNnLbtuLdkoIESsKmeODxkJ3lBy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159858,"logo_path":null,"name":"What's Up Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jackie Without Jack","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
