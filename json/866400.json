Their insightful and provocative responses provide the central theme of the film, a half-hour examination of how the media presents girls. Juxtaposing footage culled from a typical week of TV broadcasting with original interviews, WHAT A GIRL WANTS will provoke debate and, ideally, act as a catalyst for change in media content.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":159860,"logo_path":null,"name":"CHC Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What a Girl Wants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
