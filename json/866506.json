They have been planning their exit for months now, ever since she found out that Gia was pregnant. Alex knew it wasn't her girlfriend's fault. Her boyfriend Gabriel (Isiah Maxwell) is controlling and manipulative. Several days later, Alex discovers that Gia has a black eye. \"We're leaving tonight,\" Alex sharply whispers. \"And I promise you... he won't hurt you or come after you ever again!\" Trying to summon up all her courage, Alex slowly takes off her clothes. The man, slowly waking up and assuming it's Gia, gives her breast a squeeze and then moves in to kiss her. His disgusting comments are matched by her aggressive fucking.","popularity":0.83,"poster_path":"/gM9q6V4ivD7xBs6UaQUMcap9TIz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gold Star","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
