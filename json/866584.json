In this peaceful rural setting, the pupils could learn, play and thrive out in the fresh air, and in this delightful colour film we see them follow a routine of lessons and religious observance, as well as painting, sport and gardening, and exploring the pine forest around the school. The original school closed in 2010.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dvqWlEDFXhpAlXtD8S7U9wvge2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autumn In Delamere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
