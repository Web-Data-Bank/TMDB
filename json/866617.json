She graced local and international stages, stirring millions with her beguiling voice and spectacular performance. Yet behind the larger-than-life persona and her memorable songs was a woman about whom we know little. She didn’t like to be interviewed and never volunteered details about herself and her family. Hers was the life of a Hollywood legend and she paid the price for it. This is a story about fame and loneliness, acclaim and loss, daring and compromise. For the first time, the woman behind the crown, the cloak and the palace will come to light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gULdSjBkdZyonBQIwcKovy2USlr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ben-Mayor \u0026 Farag Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen Shoshana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
