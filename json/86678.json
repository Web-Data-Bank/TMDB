This documentary is a fascinating look at the story of \"acid\" before it hit the streets.  Featuring interviews with many LSD pioneers, Hofmann's Potion is much more than a simple chronicle of the drug's early days. With thoughtful interviews, beautiful music and stunning cinematography, it is an invitation to look at LSD, and our world, with a more open, compassionate mind.","popularity":0.613,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hofmann's Potion: The Pioneers of LSD","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6}
