Our warm friends have migrated from the moribund Sentier to the flourishing suburb of Aubervilliers ... Where the old Jewish entrepreneurs left the ground to young courageous and dynamic Chinese wholesalers ...  The little band is as close to each other as in previous episodes, and life goes on at the mercy of small family events and business.  Dov still seems frivolous, enterprising Eddie, chilled Yvan, casual Karine, resolute Sandra, naive Chochana, irresponsible Serge and mythomaniac. As for Patrick, he is in love and the happy elected is far from easy to access.  Everything would be fine until a bad wind brings its share of adversity seriously compromising the cohesion of the group.  Will they succumb under the storm to the turmoil, or, once again, by mutual aid, cunning and skill, will they triumph over the crisis with panache?","popularity":6.098,"poster_path":"/3cIzGJeIJUmWn7g7jW6qP2ERjiL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23545,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Vérité Production","origin_country":""},{"id":3092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Manuel Munz","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":22763,"logo_path":null,"name":"Télégraphe","origin_country":""},{"id":2756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vertigo Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-01-31","revenue":40924982,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Truth, we missed you!","title":"Would I Lie to You? 3","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":307}
