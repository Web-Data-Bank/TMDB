Shot in one take on the 2020 autumnal equinox, when day and night are equal lengths, and screened on the same date, MARX transforms this iconic figure into a kind of unnatural landscape, subject to constant change beneath the evolving light of night and day. Turning notions of time upside down and inside out, this 24-hour film will be screened at 17 worldwide venues all at once – like an artificial sun rotating around the Earth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tAc0DDntREqpdhifTgjvlFrfiO3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marx","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
