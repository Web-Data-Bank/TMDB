When he tries to do so, he feels out of control, like he is falling. To cope with that dissonance, he steals things of personal value from his partners before leaving; something to hold onto to stop the falling. It has become a destructive habit. However, when Kobi meets Peter, who really pushes him to open up before they hook up, Kobi finds himself wrestling with his own anxieties and behavior.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/teRmXEhsMdN5UrsVpGU6bwEwAOY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Takeback","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
