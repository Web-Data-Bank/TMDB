She is very close to her parents and working in the family greengrocer business when, against all expectation, she falls in love with a spirited and somewhat older rainbow girl, Andrea. Andrea claims to be suffering from stress. But in reality, she is heartbroken and has sought refuge at her uncle’s apple plantation. Liv’s encounter with Andrea becomes the catalyst for a divorce, the loss of a friendship and an identity crisis that ultimately shatters their love. But in a rebellion against her parents, Liv realises that love is mutable and that a family may assume many forms.","popularity":2.474,"poster_path":"/5VjMsijd47oryovu97W9HFgppOb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167854,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motor Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Venus Effect","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":10}
