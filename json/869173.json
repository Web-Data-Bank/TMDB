Raymond is also a priest, doing what he has wanted to do ever since he was a teenager.  Filmmaker Serge Giguère paints an intimate portrait of a man who has spent 30 years fighting for an alternative vision of life in his community. The film is a blend of cinema vérité and social history that provides a view of the man and his work from without and within, from the poetry of his personal diary laced with doubts and self-criticism, to the many achievements of the community groups he helped.  Filming over several years, Giguère gives us a sense of the changes in values and attitudes of those who run our society, along with the role of the community groups who provide solutions, inspiration and a sense of renewal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6IW3RRyw8a2VZZCfJi4Yxp1dmHB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123923,"logo_path":"/ygIFNeSRwgq1Ixx68Izx6CXql2i.png","name":"Films du Rapide-Blanc","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9 St-Augustin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
