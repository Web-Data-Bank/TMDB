We half recognise India here and there, but the unusual never becomes a symbol of the exotic. Be it the sandy trench being stamped down by a man’s expert sidestep or the leafage reflected in the tiny mirror decorating a woman’s costume, a chicken’s foot protruding from a steamer or the rhythmic thud of laundry beaten on stone, each element is captured in all its strangeness and, at the same time, in a familiar perfection that bears the mark of hand or tool. Like a Francis Ponge, François Daireaux uses the precision of his sharp cuts and fades-to-black to sculpt from reality, polish objects, movements, forms, elements, and finally rejuvenate our way of seeing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wA5uGRguLTY4S4QqeAOiwlXDhuf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Areas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
