Textures of the skin filmed in extreme close up appear in single or short frame bursts and, accompanied by percussive sounds, create a fast paced rhythmic journey around the surface of the body. This film is then seen at a later stage, as a filmstrip manually reexamined on a light box, alongside spoken analysis of the exposure times. Then, old photos of my mother, and her mother, on the beach, are seen in close-up. The DIY analogue film processing method gives this material a burnt brown look while the inclusion of “mistakes,” such as fogged and scratched sections, emphasize the sense of exposure and damage to skin and to film material.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gsWnywyYrizm2Uwe30HCBmc9PvH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"re:exposure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
