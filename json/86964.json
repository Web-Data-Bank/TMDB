On boats they penetrate deep into the delta of the Amazon to experience the exceptional natural spectacle of a several-metres-high tidal wave, which has been born hundreds of kilometres away in the ocean and which under certain climatic circumstances and under the full moon penetrates deep into the flow of the Amazon River. The surfers set off to meet this frightening wall of water and to surf on it for several kilometres. With its enormous force, this tidal wave also has devastating consequences for the landscape of the river.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/cTZBiXpMt1dnmQk0x4COg3djjRv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126224,"logo_path":"/xDMxcUPPExxNgJ4OY1UfyYLxexx.png","name":"Red Bull TV","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Longest Wave On Earth","title":"Pororoca: Surfing the Amazon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
