Indeed, central to the story are two very distinct enterprises: El Pescadito - a seafood truck that’s been parking at the same swap meet in South L.A. since 1982, and Grill ‘Em All, the prestigious first-season winner of The Great Food Truck Race on The Food Network in 2010.","popularity":1.161,"poster_path":"/iPHnvTJqEQNoKUs87NKz4AtXHVJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Concepts Completos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Backstreet to the American Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
