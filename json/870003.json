He initially thought he would simply go down during the day and capture footage when possible, but he quickly realized that if he wanted to truly capture how these people lived and the full reality of their collective and individual existence, he would have to be there full time and become a part of the place, so he moved in with them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yBCCHhzNBFPtNwE9UzNYM6hbi8S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artica Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living in Tents","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
