The race to get back to normal made us question this very idea of normalcy itself â€“  Is it normal that our planet is dying because of our economic priorities?  Is it normal when lockdowns only protect the rich while the economically disadvantaged are left jobless and take to the streets?  Is it normal that our children and relationships are dependent on the thin addictive threads of technology  Is it normal that we live in a world without kindness?  This film uses poetry and visual metaphor to explore these questions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l4Q3EWqLypkv5Exfw6ORiNfaA96.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Running Cow films","origin_country":""},{"id":160214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lockdown Shorts studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Normal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
