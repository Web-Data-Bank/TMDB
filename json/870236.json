With the four-pound trigger pull, Jared and Sergei - two youths from vastly different backgrounds - become forever linked. From that split second as the hand of the clock hits 8:37, each of their lives veers onto a path that sets the seeds of their mutual destruction. 22 years later, Jared is released from prison for the death of Sergei's father; deeply regretful, he tries to forge ahead into a better life. Sergei, now a professor of mathematics, descends into a guilt-ridden abyss of a revenge-driven obsession. Both men must face their demons; one man might lose his life, the other his sanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two lives change with the pull of a trigger!","title":"8:37 Rebirth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
