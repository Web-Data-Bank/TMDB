His widow, co-author, and research partner, Ann—alongside friends, family, and colleagues—gives a guided tour of their life and laboratory, reflecting on how risks and revelations opened a world of compound enlightenment. Stippled with spirituality, sadness, and skepticism, the Shulgins’ chemical love story examines the power of psychedelic psychotherapy, sacred alchemy, and challenging the path of misunderstood resistance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s7dmGGdidU98jOcOz6INHbcsU1L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9118,"logo_path":"/9o6KLcDBRw3fNItUflJVwj8dZpC.png","name":"Samuel Goldwyn Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Better Living Through Chemistry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
