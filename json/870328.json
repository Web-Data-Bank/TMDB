A world where love dare not speak its name, yet everybody is searching for it. On his search Dorian comes across the many mirrors of his soul. The dangerous and charismatic Lord Henry casts him into a hedonistic lifestyle; Sibyl Vane sees him as the Romantic lead and Lady Henry merely wants to prey on him. But it is the gentle society painter, Basil Hallward, who shows him as he truly is. On his quest to find his true identity, Dorian must decide if it is better to be loved or to be feared. When Dorian realises the painting is, in fact, a portrait of his conscience, he is horrified to see the level of corruption depicted on the canvas and decides to try to reverse time. \"I would give anything for that - I would give my soul!\" But is it too late?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sbJdssxBBT5mAZks0UfLPNGwJJI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorian: A Rock Musical","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
