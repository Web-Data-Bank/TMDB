In the film, the two artists negotiate Fanon’s ideas, examining the politics of race, racism and the post-colonial, and how these societal issues affect their relationship. Their conflict is played out through a script that melds found texts and personal testimony, transposing their drama to a junkyard houseboat at an unspecified time in the future. Navigating the past, present and future, Achiampong and Blandy question the promise of globalisation, recognising its impact on their own heritage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5hzpI8xIYSDmauchFHc1uRVKTvu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Fanon 1","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":12}
