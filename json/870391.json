It is the story of how they felt about and in their body in relation to others, and the meaning that the world impressed upon their body before the surgery. Since having top surgery, Reid has felt more at home in her body than ever before. Like so many people in the world, Reid’s gender identity is hybrid and fluid. It is an assemblage of many different ideas, words, feelings, energies, lived experiences, and now, altered body parts. It is a gender that is somewhere in between.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qlfTlnPERWlgsDnQAchyGGST0Ii.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Like many people in the world, Reid’s gender identity is hybrid, fluid, and somewhere in between.","title":"Somewhere In Between","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
