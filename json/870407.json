Armed with 40-year-old maps of the area and a GPS device, he must navigate the park on foot and he recruits a local tribesman from the area - Dorai, to serve as his guide. The severity of the task immediately becomes apparent to Dhruv. Aside from the physical challenge posed, he struggles with his wayward assistant. Not only is Dorai addicted to alcohol, but he also appears to be terrified of officials and uniforms. Through the course of their journey, however, the two forge an unlikely friendship and a relationship between equals. When an accident takes him to Dorai's village, the wool of 'civilisation' is lifted from Dhruv's eyes and his attitudes towards the marginalised are transformed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4GIWWz1SkuIAkhi1rgyOeib8gwi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2021-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road to Kuthriyar","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
