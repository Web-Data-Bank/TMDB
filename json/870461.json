Witness life in Jaguarland, where a king must be ready to fight to keep his crown, two young brothers hone their skills, and a young female plays cat and mouse with wily rodents. Then see how local ranchers have learned to coexist with jaguars, which once threatened their livelihoods, by establishing ecotourism as a new revenue stream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dm5BOzlYR3yP5wMP8xiGKCwl76d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jaguarland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
