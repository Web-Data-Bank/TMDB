At the peak of the dry season, the floodplains bake and a searing struggle for life begins. However, there is an oasis that stubbornly refuses to disappear, a mysterious place that serves as a sanctuary for a host of animals and a hunting ground for predators. This is the story of Rebel Lake, where secretive tapirs bathe, wading birds take their pick of the fish-filled pools, and mighty jaguars hungrily prowl its banks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pVdI1kxDMUdvs0BW85KadsbwXux.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137140,"logo_path":"/24Gu0QzuDp6umZ3qgnwAru6KiiC.png","name":"The Smithsonian Network","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brazil's Emerald Oasis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
