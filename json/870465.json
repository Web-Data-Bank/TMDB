But of all his military feats, perhaps his greatest was leading his massive Carthaginian army of men and three-dozen elephants across the Alps and into the heartland of Rome in 218 B.C. Until now, the route they took has been a matter of dispute, but thanks to modern-day technology, geomorphologist Bill Mahaney and microbiologist Chris Allen believe they've accurately traced this ancient journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5lyRPf6MGE7hdFobAxpHYPwS70b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hannibal's March on Rome","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
