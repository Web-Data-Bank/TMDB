It's home to some very rare species, including the drill -- one of the most endangered primates in the world. Join us on a jungle expedition as we uncover the secret life of these reclusive primates and track down the seasonal migration of the goby -- a plucky fish battling its way upriver past strong currents, deadly predators, and even a 100-foot waterfall, to reach the spawning grounds of its youth.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/MbmeUSX2UXRz4JRQ2ooAvIL3vJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137140,"logo_path":"/24Gu0QzuDp6umZ3qgnwAru6KiiC.png","name":"The Smithsonian Network","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monkeys of Bioko","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
