We travel over both lines on one service, formed of a class 143 Pacer. The branch from Exmouth to Exeter hugs the shore of the wide River Exe estuary for the start of its  9 miles to Exmouth Junction, where it joins with the former LSWR main line from Waterloo through Exeter Central.  At Exeter St Davids, this limited stop service heads over the Barnstaple branch. The single line runs for 37¾ miles, the first section through Crediton being over the former LSWR main line into Plymouth and North Cornwall. Here we pass the down train. At Eggesford another train is passed and we follow the  token exchange procedure from the signal box at Crediton.  Our train continues through the scenic Devonshire countryside to Barnstaple in glorious summer sunshine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7UIBzWhLnfzSOAcoLpT1cIdGW7E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exmouth to Barnstaple","title":"Devon Branches: Exmouth to Barnstaple","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
