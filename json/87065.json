As beguiling a raconteur as he is a performer, Louie makes for a wildly entertaining movie subject, and Zwigoff honors him with an unsentimental but endlessly affectionate tribute. Full of infectious music and comedy, Louie Bluie is a humane evocation of the kind of pop-cultural marginalia that Zwigoff would continue to excavate in the coming years.","popularity":1.36,"poster_path":"/4pdAoyw04eXprKh0mpGvAomS3KC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Superior","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Filmed at the 1985 Friscofest","title":"Louie Bluie","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":10}
