This schizophrenic condition of an imaginary and non-specific authorial self is caused by self-shaming and guilt of the regrettable past, which can be experienced in the current time where making a mistake is often unforgivable. The image of the endless tunnel from the vision of a person inside of a slide is juxtaposed playfully with the voice. From a perspective of a slider, ‘Limbo’ invites viewers to experience strange yet familiar hyperreality and to blur the concrete state of existence by taking a journey of going through the liquid condition of waterslide.","popularity":1.15,"poster_path":"/wsp6DgIS006i38xNakDhKL9asZC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Limbo","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
