Exploring the dynamic personalities and compelling life stories of a diverse group of women, Grounders captures an inside view of a unique sub-culture, and a thoughtful and uplifting revelation of their community emerges.  With Brooklyn as the backdrop, and connections that blur the boundaries of race, class, age, religion, and sexual orientation, these women have many stories to tell about why they are there.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lcKTlmMVkCOlfFAYKTT1Bs2H4u8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grounders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
