The student is subordinated to the trainer during the lessons, ready to be guided and shaped by him. Yet from a certain moment she becomes the author and the authorial narrator. As a voice over, her speech overlays the command-like speaking of the teaching situation and self-confidently opposes it with another register. The teacher’s words are decreased and cut off as the student finds a pictorial language with which she describes how song birds assert their territory through their singing, and therefore raise their claim to space. The films consists of a collage of several lessons with a voice and speech trainer from a music and theatre school. The learning objective of the student was the desire to speak in a space-occupying way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Territorial Fight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
