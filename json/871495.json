In this fantastic, primitive-future world, the difference between technology and magic has become incomprehensible. Our characters become entangled in a cargo-cult of Margaret Thatcher, and buy a Maggie doll which spouts  quotations to guide them when they pull its string.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4HYdxA70MmsscgbMJ3bKMtiinEv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unspeakable Freedom Device","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
