The stories of the characters begin with their most important gathering: the film starts with a flashforward scene that anticipates the ending: a huge townfolk party. The facts about the faces, the voices that the viewer discovers in that celebration are explored in the journey, encounter after encounter, step by step, which ends in the great community celebration.","popularity":0.924,"poster_path":"/cq1DFyILLiijtjv3rCpYjewolve.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Bolu","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
