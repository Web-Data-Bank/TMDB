This territory named Krajina which means 'frontier' or ' the edge', is the land given by the Habsburg emperor in 17th century to the Serbian refugees from all over the Balkans to settle down and defend the border from the Ottoman empire. Today, formally the part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, this land is still the imaginary line between the two civilizations, between east and west. It is a bewitched space, a dystopian universe where the ghosts return from all the past battles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dTObOTkHksiho61UGBcxNUf6tKz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
