The market was hungry for female labourers with a grasp of crafting skills. In addition to being wives and mothers, many women entered the labour market at that time. This ‘streamlined comedy' (as it was advertised) is called Three Love Affairs, but the main action is centred on the lovers played by Ting Ying and Cheung Yee. In order to make themselves more appealing, the factory girl pretends to be the daughter of a successful businessman, while the chauffeur pretends to be from a wealthy family. Their relationship is fraught with worry and anxiety, because they are confused about their own identities, and have not yet come to terms with themselves and their lives. With the support of the Manufacturers' Association, the film was shot on location at an actual factory, evidencing a prosperous period in Hong Kong's industrial history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1GsIJOjOmGKYtT1VdxtrPeBdCq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lan Kwong Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Love Affairs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
