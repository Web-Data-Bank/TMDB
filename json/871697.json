But today no white lions exist in the Timabavti range where they originated. That is until a team of conservationists brings one special lioness and her three cubs out of captivity and into the natural habit of their origins. Two years into the project, Linda has achieved much of what she set out to do but the hunting policy hasn't changed and the genetic marker hasn't yet been identified - meaning the white lions are still not a protected sub-species. Whilst this challenge still remains, Marah's legacy lives on as her daughter produces the white cubs, and the brothers are ready to breed with the tawny lionesses. Linda continues to fight for the protection of these magical lions and looks forward to the day when it will be safe for her lions - and all white lions - to roam freely in the Greater Timbavati Ecosystem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f4LqfNlUHWY4xVKOrZJrauTJBKh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return of the White Lion","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
