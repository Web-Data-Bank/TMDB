Large parts of the Netherlands have been flooded and millions of people have sought refuge in Limburg; the last refuge where everyone hopes for a new life as they knew it. But nothing is left to chance in this sanctuary. Doctor Frank (Bruno Vanden Broecke), the gene doctor, helps you find the ideal child with the best genes and brains. And Alecto (Angela Schijf), an all-controlling, self-learning artificial intelligence, is always helpful in all decisions. From lunch to love, it's best to leave your affairs to Alecto. This new world offers the perfect relationship with a partner exactly as we dream of him or her, and even the sex is better in virtual rooms. But how do you find your own way when everything is based on data, coincidence no longer exists and the role of humans seems to be becoming less and less important?","popularity":1.239,"poster_path":"/aHm3XSakZBhYry8riSHXSxyHGcX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(R)Evolutie","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":3}
