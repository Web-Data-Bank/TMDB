He is old, his body is tired, he knows he will die soon. We follow him in his solitude and his rituals. He uses his native language to talk to the trees, to the spirits of the animals he hunts and to his brother who died a few years ago. By taking a close look at Amadeoâ€™s daily life, the film questions bigger issues : the destruction of the Amazone, the disappearance of indigenous people and cultures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b8g5OMUoMBIlT1RPYV5dpbRDBC6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jonathan Millet","title":"La Disparition","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
