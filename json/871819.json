Fascinated by his artistic expression and energy, she invited him to a series of candid video-documented conversations between the two. The short documenatry film ‘In Love with Craziness’ is based on these conversations, incorporating Kildal’s music videos and personal photo albums.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rvyaiz2H16x6RnDQLLgwEOVK66Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121863,"logo_path":null,"name":"House of gary","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2020-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Love with Craziness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
