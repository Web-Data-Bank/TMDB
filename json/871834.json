On the island, there are two extremely contrasting atmospheres, from crowded hordes to hours of emptiness. This contrast emphasises its sense of place as an island, both geographically and psychologically.  Island sheds light on the lives of some of the residents of the island, and the questions “where are you now?”, “why are you here?” and “what happened to you?” will be put to the subjects of the film, the audience, and the director herself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jUaVr90ZIuW1uXMFyvEaJmFxKBm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
