How did the domestic abuse services sector cope with the pandemic? What were the experiences of the frontline workers of the domestic abuse sector? With a range of interviews recorded on Zoom during and at the end the lockdown period, this film offers for the first time, first-hand accounts of keyworkers and key players of the domestic abuse services from their own voices and images. The interviews offer exclusive stories of keyworkers reflecting on their experiences of vicarious trauma, how they worked selflessly while dealing with the implications of the pandemic themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c45RMIqqd1WCd2rzab8PqmNzMln.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lifeline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
