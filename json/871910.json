The film is not simply about Malavika Sarukkai; it deliberates the valuable connections and departures that the artist makes from a hallowed and, often, unforgiving tradition. Today, even as she impresses her footprint on the world stage as a celebrated Bharatanatyam dancer, Malavika finds herself making increasingly personal choices about how she wishes to lead that life. It is this co-existence of consummate expression with a deeper, spiritual quest that makes her dance so exciting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unseen Sequence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
