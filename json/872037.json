A ramshackle leaning hut with broken windows, a never-heated stove, an old cousin on the next bed. And here, in the house, there is a goat and two horses, which in fact are both a symbol of Kuzmich's life and his stove. The transmigration of souls and the new coming of Christ to Earth, unity with Nature and God - this is his Faith. \"When all borders between countries and people are erased,\" he says at the end of the film, \"then the kingdom of God will come.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man Who Put Idea In","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
