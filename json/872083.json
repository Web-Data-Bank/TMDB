Architect Alexander and artist Marina with their young son Ilya settled here almost 30 years ago. They left the big city in search of peace, solitude and freedom. Ilya grew up in the forest and in the mountains. Now he has the Internet – the only source of communication with the outside world. The relationship between the heroes, externally built on love and attention, internally is full of Chekhov's drama...
