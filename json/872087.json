Пришелец","overview":"Victor Sosnora is one of the most mysterious figures in Russian poetry. Having known fame in the 60s – triumphant performances on stage, friendship with Lilya Brik, publications abroad – he chose the path of a hermit, a lonely wolf. Not a member of any associations, not at enmity with anyone, he turned out to be one of the most unread poets of our time... And now his name was again in the spotlight – Viktor Sosnora became a laureate of the “Poet” national prize. Writer Andrei Bitov, literary critic Vladimir Novikov, professor of the chemistry department Maria Khripun took part in shooting this film. Poems and prose of Sosnora are read by the Honored Artist of Russia Aleksey Devotchenko.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Victor Sosnora.
