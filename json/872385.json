Shogo knows there is a much larger insect collection in his father's room, which is always locked.  But when his father Toru comes back from his job overseas, where he is touched by the reincarnation philosophy of India and Bhutan, he tells Shogo that he doesn't want to collect insects anymore.  Shogo's grandfather, Tadashi, treats his dead wife's ashes as a living figure, but the noodles Tadashi gives her remains in a bowl.  “Has grandma reincarnated into something else?” Seeing adults' different views of life and death, Shogo wonders what death is all about.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nWr76p2hNFKQu0isI2HAOnnEYNW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm ten, then I'll catch eleven.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
