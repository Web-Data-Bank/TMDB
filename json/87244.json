Pop tells Andy not to bother him only to hear a knocking at the door. The \"knocking\" is really coming from a woodpecker pecking against their roof. Pop sets out to trap the bird but is no match for its screwiness. He uses a wind-up explosive decoy that the bird falls for but when it explodes, he just feels \"betrayed!\" After giving Pop a wild ride through the sky, Andy pours salt on his tail and traps it! Two ambulance attendants come to take the bird away but they too are just as looney!","popularity":2.603,"poster_path":"/zw2cc8kJtopIcJm7PKTgM8xz3to.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knock Knock","video":false,"vote_average":7.423,"vote_count":13}
