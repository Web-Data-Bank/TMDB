The film is about the experience and absorption of something non-digestible. Something foreign and other, that one can not assimilate, that remains within ourselves as a foreign body and provokes rejection reactions. The short and destructive energy of a lightning is delated into a state of stasis as an overreaction. The film studies dialectical relations between black and white, the human and the non-human, light and shadow, security and insecurity, sound and silence, the known and the unknown, yourself and the other, in an audiovisual minimalist meditation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vogiWZQc8zWPQfSJWb0k1DCFQzz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Place I Will Have Left","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
