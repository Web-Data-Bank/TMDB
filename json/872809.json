After becoming volunteers in the prison and residing for more than a month under the semi-open regime, the documentarists recorded the daily life behind bars, inviting prisoners and employees of APAC to open their hearts and share their stories and perceptions about life. The documentary is mostly composed by informal conversations that portray different aspects of the lives of incarcerated individuals, such as spirituality, family life, work, music and the desire for freedom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":160693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Café Royal","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":125049,"logo_path":"/pXPj0HsFjcvv8OINE4yVgB0AXst.png","name":"BRO Cinema","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Love No One Escapes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
