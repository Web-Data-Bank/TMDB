A bit of an odd character, Triangle Woman has kept these stories locked up in her head for many years. The film includes stories about a man whose finger rapidly deteriorates and the impending consequences; a nice lady who really isn't that nice; an old woman who talks backwards; an employment agency that has a man-toy named Mr. Brombellarella; among other stories. Triangle Woman is the thread that binds all of the stories together, and she imprints her bizarreness throughout the entire film.","popularity":1.878,"poster_path":"/tIJmXhuwMFVb3G8lNU2ETda6OJP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Many Strange Stories Of Triangle Woman","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":1}
