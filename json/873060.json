The break between them comes when Leah, the headstrong and fearless of the two, severs the already fragile bonds of family and school life and rushes headlong into a darker world where, if pressures still exist, the players are at least less judgmental. Meanwhile, Sarah, timid and more plant by nature, nevertheless rebels against her friend's choice and is at first relegated to spectator while Leah is almost willingly made the pawn of the destructive man she loves. As Leah slides deeper into the surreal, we watch as Sarah makes her own extraordinarily dangerous choices to save her friend from certain destruction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5q3G4LltJxykgrp6XeYPQGi9SMF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Choices","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
