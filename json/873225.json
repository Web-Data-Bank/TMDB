Working closely with 猫 シ Corp., the archival experts of CCTV have synthesized media from hundreds of sources, creating a dreamlike meditation on the lost entertainment, telecommunications, and advertising that shaped a generation’s collective conscious.  As we face an uncharted era of the Information Age, News at 11: Liberty Edition looks to the past to illuminate what might be ahead—championing our drive for resilience and innovation, while reminding us of our capacity for understanding and compassion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yh65GkoPXY8s8iYpFMmzF1MgVS5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Utopia District","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"E PLURIBUS UNUM","title":"NEWS AT 11: LIBERTY EDITION","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
