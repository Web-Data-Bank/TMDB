He was a radically experimental artist of genius who won immense critical acclaim for his photographic work. In the 1920s, Man Ray directed four films which, although they are little known to the general public, made him a major figure in avant-garde cinema. His film-making was as radical as his pictures and his objects. This is a collection of his works including 10 short home movies never before released.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uYsn20u0Bb6SxV7NqxaAqVWwNyl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Films of Man Ray 1923-1940","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
