At the crucial point of relinquishing his realm, Lear demands to know which of his daughters loves him the most. His ambitious older daughters answer with false praise and lavish flattery, however his youngest daughter, who does truly love him, answers with honesty. Wildly unsatisfied with her response, Lear’s rage sets in motion catastrophic consequences. Ultimately stripped of his privilege and its trappings, Lear must reckon with his own humanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c0pALld8927oFdEQ8fwjlD3aRJL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakespeare \u0026 Company","origin_country":""},{"id":150517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakespeare Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King Lear","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
