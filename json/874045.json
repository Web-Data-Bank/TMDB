In the early 80s, José Miguel Etxeberria Álvarez, alias 'Naparra', a member of the Autonomous Anti-capitalist Commandos, was disappeared. Between crossed statements, numerous vindications and judicial indifference, his family will try to find an answer for his disappearance. More than forty years later, Eneko has taken up the baton of the search for his brother to close the wound that has remained open for so many years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aHHC3pZUKm6b7SrtM8R0hi44NpF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113535,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Produkzioak","origin_country":""},{"id":83958,"logo_path":null,"name":"VraiVrai FIlms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story of a Steering Wheel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
