Funerals. The origins of culture are built on farewells. Burial mounds, tombs, mausoleums and pyramids were filled with objects that belonged to the departed. Bandaged, mummified, they were buried alongside their owners since they were extensions of their hands, legs and bodies.  An eighteen day vigil in the Modern Art Gallery of Majewski’s native town of Katowice was an attempt to pay a simple homage to a young woman who died in a car accident. It evolved into a mysterious ritual connected to the myth of the fountain of life-giving blood, an archetype of female cyclicality. Reminiscent of priestesses from Böcklin paintings, silhouettes in lucid gowns moved in a slow motion making the audience participate in a ceremony that felt like an ancient funeral, creating a symbolic mausoleum at the Gallery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xTZcnKgvy8MkPs0ZGS1PVO9UK00.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A vigil reminiscent of an ancient funeral rite; an homage to a young woman who died in a car accident.","title":"Accident","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
