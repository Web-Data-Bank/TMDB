After a narrator sets the scene for various segments from the film, the piece takes its time to take a closer look at all of the elements that are necessary to create the movie and the challenges of shooting such a labor- and authenticity-intensive picture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uzLlxk7j51kWdyd4ycWVD8JEgSD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23929,"logo_path":null,"name":"SÃ¼dfunk Stuttgart","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Boot: Behind The Scenes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
