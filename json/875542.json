In this space, two men, who have a seemingly deep but incomprehensible bond, try to coexist seamlessly while making space to accept the inherent fluidity of human sexuality, for one another. As their exploration, of the 'queer' within, acts in sync with the space around them, their relationship goes through a silent but unrestrained struggle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lOR2MvSiTHv9yJudup5ewJh5oow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
