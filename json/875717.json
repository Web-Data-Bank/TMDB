Why are the majority of them women and immigrants? The well-traveled show “Clean City” of the Onassis Foundation Stegi becomes a hybrid film. Four separate directors follow the tour of the show to four cities - Skopje, Sarajevo, Montpellier, Istanbul. Immigrant cleaners, stars of the show but also of their real lives, talk about their experiences, touch on the subject of racism in terms of what is “pure”, the danger of fascism, female immigration and sexual abuse. An anthology film somewhere between documentary and fiction, having as its starting point the filmed theatre play by Anestis Azas and Prodromos Tsinikoris.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bm3LPtwqvDgacn3y0hlJGd0wGdS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132155,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Onassis Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clean Cities","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
