In Part 2, Clinton wins the 1996 election in a landslide, pulling off one of the greatest turnarounds in political history. But as Clinton sails buoyantly into his second term, times are good, the economy is booming, and American prestige and power internationally are at an all-time high. Clinton's dream of repairing the breach with Republicans seems within reach. But Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky -- a White House intern -- becomes public after she confides in a co-worker named Linda Tripp.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5xZ0WP78qLIUnOxBe3XUbUiBlqA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clinton: Part 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
