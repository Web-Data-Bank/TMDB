The National Opera, too, faces a serious challenge: How can they make the enormous effort demanded of them by Le Nozze di Figaro worthwhile without having an audience?  With two years of preparation time and performances that have long sold out, Mozart’s opera Le Nozze di Figaro is an ambitious international production by the National Opera. But when the opera house is forced to close due to COVID-19, everyone’s biggest fear becomes reality. What is an opera without an audience? What can they do to make sure all the hard work has not been for nothing? In the spirit of Le nozze di Figaro and in the style of the opera buffa (comic opera), Crazy Days demonstrates how important it is to create things of beauty, precisely in these insane pandemic times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n6bmgZ27qIfb7OL3aDmrphyJISk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crazy Days","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
