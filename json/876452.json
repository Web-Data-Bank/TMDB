The narration presents a case that the brutal assault was cold-blooded and senseless, causing an avoidable tragedy.  Handheld footage of the city provides a backdrop as Macdonald recounts the events of the rebellion, focusing in particular on Gov. Nelson Rockefeller’s refusal to negotiate and his role in escalating the conflict that resulted in 43 deaths. Both a screed against political power and a memorial to those who lost their lives, Still Attica Remains details some of the horrors of prison— unfortunately relevant today as it was in 1975.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Attica Remains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
