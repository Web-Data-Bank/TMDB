Piotr Szczepański reveals another surprising piece of the cultural mosaic of Łódź in his documentary. The protagonists' lives prove that close ties with their religion and history do not exclude their relationship with counterculture and propensity for creative provocation. Thanks to people like them – open-minded and unconventional – the Jewish culture has a chance to last and thrive in our country. Besides, ‘@miriamfrompoland’ is a story, which presents a traditional, yet not quite typical, family with impressive observational virtuosity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"@miriamfrompoland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
