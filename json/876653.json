It is estimated that there are at least 400,000 transgender people living in China. This is by no means a small number, and the realities of their lives are almost never as simple as those of transgender celebrities, like Jin Xing. This documentary not only presents the realities of transgender individuals in Asia, it also provides assistance to those living with unanswered questions about their own identities, giving an inside look on the process of sex reassignment surgery, as well as the social support available to LGBTQ communities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/azv659L6YVo3HNu6j4ObRauayAC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Place: Transgender Stories from Asia Screening and Discussion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
