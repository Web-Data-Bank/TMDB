In this new work, which was co-produced by Phileas, Fleischmann reflects on the cultural impact of the monumental 30.000 square meter pavilion and interacts with its physical space through the medium of film, using a series of large, site-specific cameras that become sculptural forms traveling through the building from floor to ceiling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aLX0K6Uj5YwbOITnCXwQPEXdTyV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled (34bsp)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
