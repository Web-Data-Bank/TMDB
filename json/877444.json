A special compartment reserved for women appears as a temporary oasis – a haven for solitude and contemplation. Director Rebana Liz John questions the women, who reveal what it means to keep ambitions alive within an oppressive patriarchal system. Black and white imagery evocatively captures the details of the women’s experience in this world. They reflect on their lives, across generations, with humour, disappointment and defiance, forming a complex tapestry whose common ground is endurance and survival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A6ZaYgnikk1oUathn2nd99jqzJ4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117,"logo_path":"/twj6GjwWKt23x21fkxItt7v7lEQ.png","name":"Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":22627,"logo_path":"/mZsZ3IYzoheUPTPN3WeFwOYxAkP.png","name":"Film- und Medienstiftung NRW","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2021-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ladies Only","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
