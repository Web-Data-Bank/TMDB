Shot almost entirely in arty and gritty black-and-white, the film has Carlitos, a young Brazilian guy, meeting his older Uruguayan lover Carlos for an extended tryst in a Buenos Aires hotel room. This romance features many tender, playful, and sexy moments, from the opening scene of Carlitos in bed, to a collage of images of the couple at the film’s end. Oliverio and the actors deftly capture the lovers’ palpable sense of desire in this striking low-budget film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ydnCIrfODKUNZE2vRnpddPhDqiX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postcards Over the Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
