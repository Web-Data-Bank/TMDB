The objective of this film is not to put a moral label on abortion, “right” or “wrong”, but open a dialogue. We intend to focus on the experiences, the reasons behind people's silence on the personal aspects of the subject, and explore how people integrate the experience into their lives. Our film focuses particularly on the director trying to reconcile the complex and intense emotions following her abortion, as well as the idea that it's impossible to understand how you would react in that situation until you find yourself in it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Womb at the Inn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
