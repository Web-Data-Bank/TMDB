This film is projected normally on a screen inflated by the wind. The viewer can move to either side of the concave / convex screen. When we perceive two images, the mind creates relationships of one to the other. This film plays on this ability of the gaze to build links between elements placed side by side. Filmic elements accumulated for some time took shape, gradually by juxtaposition.  Material: two 16mm projectors - curved screen five meters long.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ballad (Extract)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
