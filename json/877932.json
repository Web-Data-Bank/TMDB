This brazen thriller follows Salman Seegers, who starts working for the Sterf­show (Death Show) as a pathol­o­gist. It comes easy to him, until a candi­date ends up on top of the Death List who is very dear to him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/abg8FxwoK560svTm9tVQvhOy2Mk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89761,"logo_path":null,"name":"Videoland","origin_country":""},{"id":46793,"logo_path":"/hLTZvck9RsRCwXYolVEjJnhep7g.png","name":"Umami Media","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Sterfshow","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
