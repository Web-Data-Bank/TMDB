We are honoured to show Stationary Peaceful Protest, an animated film by jazz musician and composer Xhosa Cole and Birmingham based animator Shiyi Li, as it looks at Xhosaâ€™s experiences of attending a BLM protest in Birmingham. It inspired him to pen a monologue about his thoughts on his own personal experience of the occasion. Intertwining his own music into a recording of the monologue, he then collaborated with Birmingham-based animator Shiyi Li - the two of them then worked together to produce a beguiling, free-flowing, and absorbing short film which is both powerful and evocative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stationary Peaceful Protest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
