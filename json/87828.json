Valentine, who disagrees with the scientific consensus on global warming, interviewed scientists about the validity of Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth and the facts presented within. The scientists he interviews deny that there is a consensus on the issue of global warming or climate change. The film argues that global warming proponents keep changing its label, basing their argument on what Valentine says is shaky scientific ground.","popularity":0.683,"poster_path":"/pqf9inDgu7ldaIBJ5lAFrWF9lAn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Inconsistent Truth","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
