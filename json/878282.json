Featuring testimonies from Black womxn all over the country, the stories of family, friends, friends-of-friends, and acquaintances from varying backgrounds and age groups are intricately woven together. The film is formed from a series of unstructured and conversational kitchen table interviews about societal perceptions on Black womxn as racialised bodies. Through these conversations, the fragments of positive and negative encounters and experiences – and the rainbow of emotions expressed – create a story of vulnerability, pain and joy that is at once liberatory and heartbreaking.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
