This moment took place within the opening of the Thames River police unit (known as the advent of preventive policing), a department of a shipping company (West India Committee) commissioned to prevent loss in their inventory. The film performs a motion-study of the \"double-shot\" that Forrester witnessed, through studying the motion of property title, as a trajectory of exchange. The physics of \"Work\" (Force x Distance), frames the historical moment in which a wage per time unit was introduced by the Thames River Police, to replace the dock-workers' traditional wage system.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joules","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
