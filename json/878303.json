This sequence is then divided and rearranged 7 times in reverse order. Each time the divisions are greater in number (smaller in size) until finally the film appears to move smoothly backwards, divided by a single frame. The inspiration for the film as well as the title is derived from information theory where a 'moment' is defined as the shortest duration at which no distinction can be made between units of information. This work is a demonstration and exploration of the line between human information and machine information. It dynamically reveals film's basic unit, the frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/plTRmF3SrWg3lHrA4IcEmuPetwg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
