He didn't see the killer, but that doesn't stop him from claiming that he did in order to get his name into the papers. Sure enough, the murderer targets Gelin as his next victim. Our hero is temporarily rescued by Jeanne Moreau, an aspiring actress who has always had a crush on him.","popularity":3.31,"poster_path":"/gGof44e4oYFmOhBXL0Dr1tPTAMZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13360,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1958-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Days to Live","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6}
