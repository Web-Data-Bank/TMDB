The boys appear with Steve Allen, Ed Wynn, and original front man Ted Healy as bungling barbers, clueless cowboys, goofy golfers, bumbling beach bums, witless witnesses, hare-brained house cleaners, and more.  You'll split your sides when you see Curly as a jumbo jockey who can't mount a horse, Shemp as a ghostly do-gooder determined to reform his partners, and Curly Joe as a near-sighted knife-thrower menacing Larry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ideuXrNiHZz6Kg4PWCzdbZ5XjET.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12313,"logo_path":null,"name":"GoodTimes Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Stooges: Kings Of Laughter","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
