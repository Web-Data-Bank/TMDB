Drawing from works by different writers, it opens up the questions of how we use time, how the simple idea of counting the days changes our perception of life, and how a fast pace influences how we remember. Departing from a wish to look back at the 2016 coup d'etat in Brazil, the film arrives at how speed and memory bind in our societies. Composed with photos and videos made over the last 10 years, the images repeat themselves overlapped with silence, a black screen, and poetry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
