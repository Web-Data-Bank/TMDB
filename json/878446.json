Zvicer, who leads Montenegro's Kavach cocaine-trafficking clan, barely survived the attack, taking five bullets to his arms and chest. His dog and three children escaped unharmed. The family may owe their lives to the quick reaction of Zvicer's wife, Tamara, who was nearby and packing a pistol. She fired at the hitmen and they ran to their getaway vehicle, a Smart car, and sped off before burning the vehicle and fleeing Kyiv. A special police unit caught up with the gunmen outside the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa the following day, May 27, 2020, on their way to cross the nearby border into Moldova. Ukrainian national police announced that they had arrested four men - but images showed five people detained.","popularity":0.618,"poster_path":"/v8hVI9RojIbjcqDpHklcQj9Uhpg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Killers, Three Cops and a Drug Baron","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
