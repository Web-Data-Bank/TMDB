Are they still relevant today? Mary Perry Stone, a former WPA sculptor, didn’t drink, smoke or lead a wild life. Her passion was being a social protest artist; it remained so throughout her life.

Her art was her own, expressive and powerful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/shlh9uUDIlcTXw5SbJcWVBlfYrw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161569,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slow Moving Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plenty to Say: The Radical Murals of Mary Perry Stone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
