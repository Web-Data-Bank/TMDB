Far from men and the madness of daily life, Cica, Nana and their friends isolate themselves voluntarily in a villa in the countryside. Together they blend joie de vivre and memories, melancholia and joyfulness, gossip and jokes. All that to keep up the illusion that time has not passed, that they are still the same beautiful and attractive girls they were 50 years ago.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6R9jeFWfQpKZCS0ITC6UJ2BsVDx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172932,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Cartel","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":142486,"logo_path":"/zjBPLzaz6x0Ei1ecI6oesRq69yo.png","name":"microFILM","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Dolls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
