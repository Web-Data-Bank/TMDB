Antonia is not happy about having to spend time under close adult supervision. On their way, she spots a sign saying ”The Robots Have Escaped!” The sign unleashes Antonia’s imagination and grows into a fantasy of how exciting her stay in the camp might turn out to be. Of course, Antonia’s and the robots’ paths intersect at the camp, where they intend to steal children’s dreams during their afternoon nap to convert them into ingenious commercials. Thriller-like events unfold. Thanks to Antonia’s inquisitive and rebellious nature and with her best friend and favourite toy Yeti by her side, the robots’ intention is averted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jquS9DeXnZrolnknPuJqATa8V1n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moonmakers","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2022-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nap","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
