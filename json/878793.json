The “songs” are seven as the principal stars of the Ursa Major. It will be a nocturnal wandering with the starry sky as a reference: an earthly pilgrimage looking for epiphanies or the drift of a hypothetical interstellar trip.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7mKITNC9JXBvXXoIF7D2c4QtZeH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dubhe (Vaghe stelle)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
