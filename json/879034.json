A meditative journey of revisitation and discovery, this short film essay maps the past through four handmade dioramas that chronicle different explorations of the suburban waterway: from the director’s own reimagined memory and a dreamscape of native fauna, to the Indigenous significance of the site and the closing vignette, in which the narrator – visiting the ford for the first time in 10 years – speaks of how tracing back can lead to memory’s own turning point.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Pz8J91Rfqj3V99OtQRY7uZvLZL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Formation of a Cloud","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
