From the 1970s to the 1990s he, Yura Diversant, a well-known figure in the Moscow hippy community, published a samizdat magazine called Svoboda and created the political art group Svobodnaya Initsiativa (Free Initiative), trying to fight the Soviet system. But this is not the most important thing in my film. For me he is, above all, my father, and I never had the opportunity to get to know him before.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We’ll Be Together","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
