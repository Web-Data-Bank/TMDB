Tayu Vlietstra, a pupil of Bertolucci, carries out an investigation on the first work of six of the most authoritative and beloved Italian directors.  The result is an unpublished and precious document that reveals the emotions and expectations of directors grappling with their cinematic debut.  Mario Monicelli, Bernardo Bertolucci, Lina Wertm√ºller, Marco Bellocchio, Liliana Cavani and Francesca Archibugi offer a still current evolution on the needs and difficulties of making cinema in our country.","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":"/v07d5sUF97eNSd2ZjLsL618pBgh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sun in Tuscany Production","origin_country":""},{"id":161689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invisibile Carpet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opera Prima","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
