But others think he's a hot-tempered narcissist, staging a publicity stunt to further his career - and when his service ends, neither the UK nor the US welcome him back. Through incisive interviews with the actor, his supporters, his detractors, and top-tier experts - and featuring the actor's own jaw-dropping helmet-cam video of deadly battles with and interrogations of ISIS fighters - Heval gives viewers unprecedented access into a war against evil and one man's controversial role in it.","popularity":1.287,"poster_path":"/xo0IjMSVS9cs59ULL0Zp2kIegtf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96320,"logo_path":"/mRs4TJMjhSbeEX893pPA3JDHjsy.png","name":"CuriosityStream","origin_country":"US"},{"id":162251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mafficking Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":99435,"logo_path":null,"name":"LINK Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":41325,"logo_path":"/gm8XtSJa8nL2Wq7GV0KeoH4E2iH.png","name":"Jupiter Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":135346,"logo_path":"/hIwjhVdOOQ1fpdebwOuDQD7bnw0.png","name":"Sky Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heval","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
