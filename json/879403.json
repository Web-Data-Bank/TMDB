Panambi features the stories of bright memories of the past and the despair of having now as a mere memory of the future without a trace of justice; how they lived and what they lived for. A decades-long struggle is shot, one in the lens of a mother paralyzed by fear; another from a mother raged and moved by fearâ€”both looking forward to a better tomorrow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/209EMEo1geNfmEnJ9r6fnb1AoKb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother's Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
