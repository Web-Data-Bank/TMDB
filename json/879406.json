The term is both a descriptor and a racial designation burdened with historical and social meanings. SAMRAA lives on in unsought nicknames, catcalls, intimacies and absences. It marks the borders of brownness/Blackness, displacing the latter and rendering it palatable.  Often used as a blunt instrument of political correctness, SAMRAA is the feminine figure distanced from the negative associations which cling to Blackness across the Arab world. SAMRAA is an experimental moving image work which explores this term as a site of both enclosure and endearment. Dita Hashi slices up Arabic pop music videos, live performances and archival footage across space and time, producing a new dissonant soundtrack made up of linguistic reiterations and derivatives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SAMRAA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
