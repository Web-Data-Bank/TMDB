After his acclaimed Thanatomorphose, genre filmmaker Éric Falardeau is both behind and before the camera in this sensory extravaganza, somewhere between an occult hallucination and a self-portrait of conflicted masculinity, that serves up a heady mix of horror, poetry and unbridled eroticism. A tribute to the magic of Méliès, the early American avant-garde and underground film (think: Kenneth Anger), Asmodeus renders bodies and fluids transcendent through its use of textured black-and-white Super 8 and in-camera special effects. A cinematic memento mori that’s at once carnal and otherworldly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aiHtCCaVlqIGtaVobiasx9inBQg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asmodeus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
