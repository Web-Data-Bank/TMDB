Jacqueline Sir directs “Sacral,” a fragmentary drama about the messy relationships and social life of a group of young NY city kids. Told with blurred low-fi imagery and a constant sense of unease and disorientation, it’s raw as they come, and paints an authentic picture of an alarming absence. When Nadia can’t locate her best friend, Silvia, she seeks out her boyfriend, Max, the last person she saw him with. As their group of friends pre-game for a party, she doubles down on Max who is behaving suspiciously evasive. A mix of edgy realism and almost nightmarish paranoia, the film’s resonance accumulates from jagged shards into a haunting mystery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lXCxWCjZLRDMctBG0GDN20SwwLO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14872,"logo_path":"/udD9q0nbMXvneV4lpqYcOR7om74.png","name":"Tisch School of the Arts (NYU)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A FILM BY JACQUELINE SIR","title":"Sacral","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
