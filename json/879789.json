It is a republic born in the throes of the Algerian War and one which—from the day it was founded by General de Gaulle until the presidency of a very Jupiterian Emmanuel Macron—has been assailed as a “Republican monarchy” by partisans of a more assertive parliamentarian state. By revisiting the struggle of those who dared oppose the new regime — only to suffer a crushing defeat on September 28, 1958, when they were barely able to garner 20% of the vote against the constitutional text — this film shines a powerful new light on the origins of the Fifth Republic and its consequences for the next 60 years.  It is a constitutional debate that planted the seeds for a complete upheaval of the French political landscape, on the left in particular, and set the country in motion toward what would be called the Union of the Left.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5V6eqcHZwtldYHkO8T7hVyeCoYk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111070,"logo_path":"/mtpksBGaM5BOpInHqLOxqVFTVWb.png","name":"O2B Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":90881,"logo_path":"/sRtQRyhTAPzsw0wUmnrpkXPQEuz.png","name":"Public Sénat","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":123946,"logo_path":"/4xNW5asBlhVC7ZlvB1VXYSrr0nb.png","name":"Toute L'Histoire","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1958: Those Who Said No","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
