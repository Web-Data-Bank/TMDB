This is tragic not least because he trains teenagers from youth welfare, for whom his run-down hall has become a home. In particular, the young, talented asylum seeker Samy, who lost her entire family while fleeing Afghanistan, has taken Burdenski under his wing. It doesn't take long for bailiff Billy Kuckuck to understand that the former boxing professional is more than just a coach for Samy and the other young people, namely also a social worker and surrogate father. Therefore, Billy looks for ways and means to help the boxing legend, and turns to his daughter Jessica. But she only saw her father from his worst sides during his sports career and doesn't want to hear anything from him anymore. Burdenski's stubbornness and pride are not helpful here either.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i2I0nRiKlCEbH0wW44bP3VEoKEZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21931,"logo_path":"/t4LXePf1f6W81RODGtTAWK5DIRt.png","name":"FFP New Media GmbH","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":6187,"logo_path":"/gtC63XG8fkFxszIuZIogffM1oY8.png","name":"ARD Degeto","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":35944,"logo_path":"/4KH89AIU5raRxMZ8pbywslRIt0S.png","name":"Das Erste (ARD)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy Kuckuck - Angezählt","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
