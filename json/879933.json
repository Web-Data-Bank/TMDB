Thoughtfully staged and split into separate acts, or \"chants,\" each is a film unto itself—microcosm, self, home, society, and macrocosm. Experimental elements are used to suggest connections through images, while voiceovers and text overlays provide historical and social context to the images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vk0BvGPLtoOFLnxTZTaPixFDVwv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chants from a Holy Book","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
