Tom was the son of mountaineer Alison Hargreaves, who perished on K2 in 1995. Mother and son, two of the greatest climbers of all time, died at almost the same age in neighbouring mountain ranges, both doing what they loved best. They now lie forever encased in the ice of two of the world’s highest mountains. Left behind to cope with the enduring tragedy are Tom’s sister, Kate, and their father, Jim.","popularity":2.906,"poster_path":"/r1buuKg7m3st9MBeiJl58ZoMxc3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135005,"logo_path":"/yHs7fh3S2JEDdYX5B0UrA5lSTjN.png","name":"Dorothy St Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":185828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Globus Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":165679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uppercut Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":6.714,"vote_count":7}
