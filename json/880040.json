Childs, Jr.’s best known production, this thirteen-minute short film tells the story of a man and woman preparing for and enjoying a dinner date. As Childs described it in an article in Amateur Movie Maker, “I got the idea that it would be fun to film the action of some person’s hand, say at a cocktail party. Upon this slender thread the light tinsel of I’d Be Delighted To! was hung.” Throughout the film, Childs’ camera focuses solely on the hands and feet of the film’s protagonists.
