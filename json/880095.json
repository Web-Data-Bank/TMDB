As India's current Hindu nationalist government pushes to redefine India as a homogenous Hindu nation, adivasis’ ways of life are under greater threat. Set among the Rathava and Bhil adivasi communities of western India, broken gods document the social impact of Hindu religious evangelism among India’s Indigenous groups. As Indigenous people join Hindu religious sects, their old gods are literally becoming broken - devotional mural paintings are being whitewashed from homes, and the earthen figurines in honour of village gods and ancestors are being left to fall apart. While for those who convert joining a Hindu sect offers the allure of a better life, those who continue to follow their old ways have become ostracized by their communities. Their broken gods have lost the power to protect them from illness and scarcity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vOvtRoQlIrWZJVvbSdTf5IsjCN4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161880,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nomad Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Gujarati","iso_639_1":"gu","name":""},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Gods","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
