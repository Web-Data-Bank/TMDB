People protested against the arrest of the politician. The number of those detained at the rallies exceeded 17,000 people, many of whom received administrative punishment in the form of arrest. There were not enough places for detention in Moscow, and therefore the detainees were sent to the Center for the temporary detention of foreign citizens in Sakharovo near Moscow. As a result, an unusual group of people gathered in the special detention center - almost a thousand young men and women who were close in spirit. This film is their memories of their days behind bars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Oid095CDP2h2owGvgDSvaKYqsS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111158,"logo_path":"/9m4vqLnfjoPeyJteUmi2LZQDJ1c.png","name":"Current Time TV","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sakharovo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
