Commissioned from travelling filmmakers Mitchell and Kenyon by exhibitor Mr Tweedale, the film was shown in February 1901 in the Pavilion theatre, part of the then unfinished Buxton Opera House.  For Buxton Skyline, Mitchell and Kenyon made a relatively rare departure from their more typical scenes of bustling crowds. The long, slow panning shot is unusually ambitious for this early period in film's history, and it's not surprising that keeping the camera steady proved a challenge too far given the technology available.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1901-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buxton Skyline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
