Partly inspired by the Doukhobors’ (a 17th-century Christian sect in Poland) Living Book, Erin Cosgrove’s film also draws on such diverse source material as string-theory, science fiction, and religious history. Meditative and humorous, the film confronts its overtly broad theme within the frame of an ongoing argument between two lifetime intimates.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Living Book","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
