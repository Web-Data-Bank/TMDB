Telemach Wiesinger visited waterfronts in France, Germany, England, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.S.A. to make a note of historic swing- and lift bridges, the last hovercrafts and the gigantic ship hoists by means of moving images. Many masterpieces of bridge construction from the heyday of ship- and railway constructions are nowadays dismantled or fall into ruins. These technical dinosaurs become a document and an allegory of Wiesinger’s timeless imagination of travel. The sound film „PASSAGE“ is his second collaboration with composer and multi-instrumentalist Tobias Schwab. The musical collage is used to reflect the cinematic language of Wiesinger and to mirror his mechanical film tools.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
