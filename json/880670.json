The leading actor, artist Werner von Mutzenbecher, brings from his „inner eye“ the viewer into a drama suspending space and time. Water and air seamlessly pass into one another, as horizontal and circular movements become one. The music, adapted from Franz Schubert‘s Doppelgänger song, has been arranged and varied for two barrel organs in reference to the motif of doubling in the film. The instrumentation alludes to the sounds of a carnival, while the character of the music emphasizes the melancholic mood of the overlayed scenes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doppelgänger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
