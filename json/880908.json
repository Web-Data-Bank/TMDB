One would not think there was a war on.\" These were famous last words from Private Benjamin Elliott. As the days of war passed, the mud became thicker, lice ran faster and trench foot inflicted itself upon many. Being the lesser evils of war, such physical effects rode alongside the masses of fallen men.

His former life but a distant dream - how he will recover this he does not know.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sxr74udkfe0cbsbGi4glfMYK4Q9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shells","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
