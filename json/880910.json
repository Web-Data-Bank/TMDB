It has its beginning in, among other things, Slettemark’s slogan ‘Opposition Must Pay Off’. The new, coffee-loving Nixon is marketed in a satirical balancing act between humor and seriousness. Slettemark’s advertising campaign is ‘a study of Nixon’s mental health’ in which ‘the face is the mirror of the soul’.
