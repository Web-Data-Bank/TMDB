While they have taken very different paths, EC3 and MATT CARDONA now find themselves on a collision course.  Since their public dismissal during a world-wide pandemic, EC3 has asked, even demanded, that Cardona answer a seemingly simple question: “Are you happy?”  EC3 believes the answer goes far deeper than MATT admits, and has tormented CARDONA on social media, his podcast and his YouTube show in a quest for the “truth.” Now, we will finally learn the answer. These rivals will face off at “Free The Narrative.”  There will be no three-letter companies or corporate wrestling brands—only answers.  In addition to this “featured fight,” EC3 has personally invited people you know and people you will know, all of whom are ready to embrace the #ControlYourNarrative movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oE7s9lXN0zo039BsAzaMdDgf4BW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free The Narrative","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
