A handful of top flyers in the world have come together to work on this project.\r Our goal is to show what we do and inspire our viewers to get out on the water and believe that nothing is impossible.\r The Waterski Community is a very special place for every single person involved in it. We want to bring the community together and show the world how amazing the sport of WaterSki Flying is and what the lifestyle of an elite athlete is all about.\r As one of the most diverse discipline of action sports in the world, we want to show our viewers what it feels like to hit a 6-ft tall ramp on waterskis while accelerating at 70mph on water. Generally, we sustain 5Gâ€™s of force and travel for about 260ft in the air. Every day we do things that have never been done before and put our lives and careers on the line for the future of our sport.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/882noU65mSulSJTtt4opZJw9JZ6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Whether you are a core waterskier or a fan, inFlight provides a unique inside look into the deep passion for waterski jumping.","title":"InFlight - The WaterSki Fly movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
