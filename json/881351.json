Three years of shooting with the latest macro camera technology and special post-processing enable a unique visual language that allows completely new insights into the world of bees - without becoming unscientific. This story is told by Anna Thalbach as the \"winter bee\" and her daughter Nellie Thalbach, who takes on the role of the \"summer bee\".
