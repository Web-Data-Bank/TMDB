Serenity's incendiary performance earned an AVN nomination for Best Actress. Her charismatic co-stars included Chris Cannon, Jewel De'nyle, Kylie Ireland, Gwen Summers, and Lee Stone.'  Join Wicked girl Serenity and award-winning director Michael Zen for an epic tale of love and lust that breaks the very barriers of time.
