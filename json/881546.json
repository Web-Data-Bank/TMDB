While none of the cartoons \"of tomorrow\" foresaw smartphones or DVD players, these far-fetched contraptions, gadgets, houses and farms, televisions, and various modes of transportation could only come from the madcap mind of Avery and his M-G-M crew. Uncut, restored and remastered in High Definition for the first time, Tex Avery Screwball Classics Collection Volume 3 is another must-own collection from the master of hand-drawn mayhem.","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/71fpRBwVQqUt5c7yT1poUMq7Sri.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tex Avery Screwball Classics Volume 3","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
