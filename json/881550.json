Jolting from the temporal to the primal experience of the unknown, gradual cues subtly suggest that the setting is Pompeii during the volcanic eruption (as represented in 35mm nitrate film of Vesuvius' most recent eruption in 1944). In the aftermath, a woman without sight feels her way to an uncertain future. Non-binary composer Cee Haines' music project C H A I N E S accompanies the visual work with a dynamic, modular score using live musicians and electronics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hn6ydT6nN9JT0FbqO14Qmey8KRW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dream In Red","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
