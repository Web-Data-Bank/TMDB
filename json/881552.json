Its core element is a video loop of a spiritual site in Southern India called 1000 steps. Over and under this I have keyed in video synthesis and feedback. It is mostly one continuous clip, with little editing and no after-effects applied. I mean it to be as performative as possible, because working live, in an expanded cinema format is my goal.\r The sound is a collage of field recordings that came from several sights in India, and includes sounds of my friends the cicadas, and groups of kids demonstrating to save the local forests.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jfRnGhKYQO5ztfFs8Ea2jOPWwig.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ten Thousand Steps","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
