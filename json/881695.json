It is based on an evangelical interpretation of the Gospel, and presents the message that one must believe in Jesus in order to be saved and go to Heaven, or face eternal punishment in Hell. The play takes the form of a series of skits in which various characters are unexpectedly killed, and find out whether they are destined for heaven or hell. If they have refused to be born again, they are sent into Hell, represented by infra-red lights and a literal Satan. If they have \"received Jesus\", they are welcomed into Heaven, represented by a white-robed Jesus, dazzling white lights and a chorus of angels.","popularity":0.662,"poster_path":"/lMUZ3zK1Lk00wqbfv3QSwveDw3C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162134,"logo_path":null,"name":"â€Ž Reality Outreach Ministries","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Unforgettable LIVE Presentation","title":"Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames","video":true,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
