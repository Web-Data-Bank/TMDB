Using a set of elementary instructions such as modulation, masking, and feedback, Telcosystems programmed a self-organizing network of algorithmic processes for the creation of spatial image and sound. The result is a non-referential world which strains the senses; an exploration along the borders of human perception, through worlds of multiplying and mushrooming clouds of light and sound, through worlds of mesmerizing spatiality and interferring landscapes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iIuRATM2BLQFog34ZjnKohZZ0BH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loudthings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
