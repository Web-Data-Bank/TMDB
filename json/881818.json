Inmates are leaving the place that has long been their only home.\r Our protagonists reside in Ward 207. They have really inhabited it – there is even a fish tank in the ward! They are not from a different planet. Humanity of the inmates may contrast with their records of committed crimes. All have their small pleasures and big plans. All are longing for changes and being afraid of them. Likewise, the term of imprisonment is running out for several of our protagonists. They are getting ready for life at large. They know how to survive in extreme circumstances but are unprepared for living a normal life. One’s return to the big world is one of the most accentuated marginal situations.","popularity":0.632,"poster_path":"/m6OJF9GSrvHnfvy5A2mAWSJ0ODs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":126600,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentarian","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2022-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See You Never Ever","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
