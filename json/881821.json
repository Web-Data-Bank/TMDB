For some, making the transition from high school to college is easy, but for others it is difficult and confusing. Out of Black and White tells the story of Chris Lewis, a college graduate who is reflecting upon his days as a freshman. What he remembers is a time of academic stress, disorientation, and doubt. Laced with wisdom from the Old Testament, Out of Black and White zeros in on a precise target that promises hope and insight for anyone who has ever experienced a traumatic season of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xpBjAvox0CcOiBnUd3TP8QjwKDW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61261,"logo_path":"/tmpDbOlLbyBz2JkeQUR1XtTAYxm.png","name":"Biola University","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Black and White","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
