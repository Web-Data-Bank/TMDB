Sara Renar, Nina Romić, Billie Joan, Mary May, Punčke and Seven Mouldy Figs share their experiences about the position of women in the music industry. Their stories intertwine and diverge but they all share a passion for music. They speak out about the discrimination they have faced, the problems with traditional record companies in the 21st century and the role of social media in their careers, and openly discuss the motivation and inspiration that drives young women to make music. They prove that music is not an all-boys club in which women are just passive consumers or attractive interpreters of works written by more capable and talented men. They raise their voice, for themselves, and all the generations of young women who will follow in their footsteps and present their work to the public.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/85CjSA4hYfYtzOBnmYv3hEe1Pkg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umjetnička akademija u Splitu","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Are Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
