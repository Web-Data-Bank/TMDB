Every January 6th from the dark of the Nunatsiavut night, the Nalujuit appear on the sea ice. They walk on two legs, yet their faces are animalistic, skeletal, and otherworldly. Snow crunches underfoot as they approach their destination: the Inuit community of Nain. Despite the frights, Nalujuk Night is a beloved annual event, showing that sometimes it can be fun to be scared. Rarely witnessed outside of Nunatsiavut, this annual event is an exciting chance for Inuit, young and old, to prove their courage and come together as a community to celebrate culture and tradition. Inuk filmmaker Jennie Williams brings audiences directly into the action in this bone-chilling black and white short documentary about a winter night like no other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/srOC7pqroV36VyPzTKlqypsMFAt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nalujuk Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
