Many of them have grown up and spent decades in America, working, paying taxes, starting families. Some can’t even speak Spanish. In a matter of days. they find themselves torn away from their children and loved ones and escorted across the border. The border town of Tijuana has become an airlock between two worlds, where the broken lives of migrants end up. For many of these deportees, the only work available is in relocated American call centres.\r Rocio, Richard and Sergio are just three of those affected. We follow them for nearly a year as they struggle to make sense of the situation they are now in and rebuild their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2MoLUasdrVWWfUu5ri1KGD4rBsz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brotherfilms","origin_country":""},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":90881,"logo_path":"/sRtQRyhTAPzsw0wUmnrpkXPQEuz.png","name":"Public Sénat","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On The Line","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
