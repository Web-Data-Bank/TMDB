He smuggles out each panel piece-by-piece with the help of fellow artists, only seeing the mural in totality upon coming home. As Jesse's work captures the art world's attention, he struggles to adjust to life outside, living with the threat that any misstep will trigger a life sentence.","popularity":1.487,"poster_path":"/2MvuTYAAtVzHHzC1zcs1fbU9kKv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15181,"logo_path":"/sjQmClxWfF4NmP01QJVY8e3UVYK.png","name":"Wavelength","origin_country":"US"},{"id":114103,"logo_path":"/zSqe6I0dKA7t8MILjcVskWeeqby.png","name":"Ajna Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":147938,"logo_path":"/5USotp1QuLWIHaJM4p6ODbuTB40.png","name":"MTV Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":173242,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giving Voice Films","origin_country":""},{"id":93092,"logo_path":"/6bzhNe066LzwT14dvYmtKNHUK8F.png","name":"Sundance Institute","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Witness a masterwork years in the making, from solitary confinement to world-renowned artist","title":"Art & Krimes by Krimes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
