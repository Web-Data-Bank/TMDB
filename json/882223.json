They are the only great apes native to Asia. Of all the apes, they are the closest to man in genetic makeup. And they face extinction.  Two years in the making, the film is an intimate portrayal of the world of orangutans, the threats to their survival and the people committed to help them thrive.  The film focuses on a recent discovery that orangutans do not rely on animal instinct for survival, but instead have a culture that they have preserved from generation to generation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jr2Ps82EwFBmCAPdBadmdAsUW5D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Collective Eye Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disenchanted Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
