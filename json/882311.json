Like the fictionalized Marco Polo from Italo Calvino’s “Invisible Cities”, the traveller in this film talks of worlds that resemble familiar places but follow their own, sometimes seemingly incredible rules. The observations condense into a meditation about the nature of cities and the transformation of the concept of globalization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/45Kbw7KkuhnmRU0Ary9sVkYLBIs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Million","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
