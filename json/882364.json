La Plaine, a lively district, a large square, a historic and popular market.  A tumultuous battle between, on the one hand, the city council's urban planning services, determined to carry out a major program of \"requalification\" of the district. On the other hand, a part of the residents, who refuse this gentrification operation, and demand to be associated to the decisions. This epic story lasts 3 years and ends abruptly with the incredible construction of a concrete wall of 2m50 high all around the square.  The television of the district, imprinted with the stories of past uprisings, a tool of counter-propaganda throughout this battle, refuses to stop at the report of a defeat and wonders.  Summoning the Free Communes of 1871, their joyful and fiery rage, a singular writing takes hold of the fiction. In order to make this collective struggle a victorious human adventure, another way of making the city and the world is envisaged.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/92CFwdPE10W0Bcpid1PxKEW0y3a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The battle of La Plaine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
