He tries to gain a better understanding of this vexed community - traditionally associated with campfires, abundant eating and drinking and music. He poses some imaginative questions in his film. More than once, however, he is told\r that something is none of his business or that 'those matters' are not discussed, especially not in front of a camera. Still, he manages to lift a corner of the veil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gipsy life: Sinti and Roma 1 - No Place of Their Own","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
