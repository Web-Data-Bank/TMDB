This partly explains why relatively little attention is paid to the scores of Roma and Sinti (the film mentions almost a million) who died in World War II concentration camps. Now that ever fewer eye witnesses are still alive, the remaining ones sparsely reveal a little more. Initially, Auschwitz\r survivor Lily only wants to explain how degrading it felt to have to undress in front of German officers - nudity and sexuality are big taboos. Still, a little later she decides to tell how women were raped and abused in horrifying medical experiments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gipsy life: Sinti and Roma 2 - A Blue Hole in the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
