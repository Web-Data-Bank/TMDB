But if you go inside and feel the particles sink over your head, the fog will be cold and the smoke will be hot. There was something very shocking about the foggy things, the fence-covered things, the deported things from the city, and the things that suddenly turned into useless trash. \"Fog and Acting\" is a work that focuses on the idea that meaning should be found from such objects. I stare at the fear I encountered in the middle of acting, the ultimate fear. Smoke rises in places where human imbalance, hatred, and aggression are suppressed. No, the fog descends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fog and Smoke","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
