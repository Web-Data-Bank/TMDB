This documentary traces Goethe’s early years, looking at his education, legal training, love affairs, and formative experiences. Using diary accounts, original manuscripts, location footage, period paintings, and readings from his works, the program highlights the writing of his popular play, Götz von Berlichingen, and his wildly successful novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther. The Sturm und Drang movement is discussed, as well as Goethe’s friendship with writer and philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Young Goethe: 1749-1775","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
