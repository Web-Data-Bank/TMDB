From orphans in the streets of Mosul to “the children of ISIS,” whose families had pledged allegiance to the caliphate. Since their existence is not legally recognized, they have no I.D., and therefore no access to education, medical care, or food assistance.Since the fall of ISIS, tens of thousands of children have also been held in camps along with the most radicalized of the women. They are living in catastrophic sanitary and humanitarian conditions that have only worsened with the Covid-19 crisis. An unprecedented investigation into a generation of young victims of the war against the Islamic State. How can we help them to believe in the future and to find a place in society, so that they do not become a threat to the international community?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cI6kOCkIgeqg9CLLacajWLsUOk1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iraq's Lost Generation","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
