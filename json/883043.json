In \"Northport\", Christian and Michael surround themselves with what moves them. The Michigan house is less formal than the Viennese apartments in the other two films. This space is filled with sunlight works of art by Michael, and interacts with more with the outdoors with its large porch overlooking the flourishing panorama of the countryside, and green-space that wraps around the structure. Photographed in color, this film highlights the bright summer of a more casual and relaxed time, while still infused with cultural elements.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northport","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
