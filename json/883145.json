Follow Neill as she finds inspiration for her latest painting, all the while expounding on her muses, which include her wife, Pat, and a handful of dear friends who are bastions of New England Yankee-ism. From the expansive blue of the Martha's Vineyard coastline to the verdant green of her garden in rural Pennsylvania, see the world through this artist's eyes, and get a peek into her process, as she explores what it really means to be \"home.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/akYhAqD3SmDL6Pm6v3j4vFbxqNQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visions of Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
