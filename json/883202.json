Capodanno 2005 - 2006","overview":"A typical Milanese end of the year: the semi-deserted streets, the sleet, a few scattered fireworks ... Yet just the right look and everything will appear new and unusual. This is what happens in this urban symphony, an authentic piece of “expanded cinema” that Francesco Ballo has recovered and edited for the Milano Film Festival. Almost four hours on a direct tour, in the camera car with comments that mark times and places, crossing the Milanese night between known and lesser known streets. A film to see and visit to celebrate cinema and its fantastic rigor, which comes out of the box. And you, what are you doing on New Year's Eve? We celebrate it on Sunday morning, with a long matinee.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Milano.
