If I took the same scene from both versions and played them at the same time, what could I find out? That was a wonderful exercise in critical viewing and side-by side analysis, but then I started to get a bit self-conscious: “Oh, maybe the audience doesn’t want to see this footage.” So, I thought maybe I can offer an alternative experience — if they don’t want to be spoiled, I can tell a story inspired by the film. This idea of having two video essays playing a the same time on different halves of the screen, the top and the bottom, and then at the beginning just instructing the audience that they can choose which one they want to see, they can simply use their hands to block the part of the screen they don’t want to see.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Right Now Then Wrong","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
