No matter what our messages are, no matter how difficult it is to get them across, we all share one desire: to be understood. But what happens when we aren't understood? \"10 Lives\" features four segments of directed improvisation that investigate a few of the ways people argue. In \"Babble,\" a young literary couple masks true feelings with metaphor. \"Abuse\" features a young woman's descent into domestic violence. Familial love and support is put to the test in \"Discourse\". The film ends with \"Silence\"; an introspective tale that unfolds after words are no longer useful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c0YjU8Na4ANLQYsUNRymO0vtjni.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 Lives","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
