Selim Bentounes surrounds himself with relatives to film the dynamics of a group of occupants, protecting the last beating heart of a universe without feelings. The dystopian flavor of Little Heart is not tasted in a profusion of effects. The film elegantly carves a melancholy into the setting, the sound, the faces and the everyday scenes that are not quite what they seem. It is far from the others that this film-parable goes however, so that the world is reborn for a moment, in an explosion of pure emotions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/utgwCfVVsTnxVOGGMeosRpbsr9E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vertical Production [fr]","origin_country":""},{"id":162398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hypernuit Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petit coeur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
