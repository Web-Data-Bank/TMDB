A moral question arises when a Maguindanawon housewife, Nhorsida whose hardpressed life forced her to peddle drugs was arrested with his innocent husband by the police. The couple while simply walking along a busy street but on the way to deliver the illegal substance is suddenly man-handled by the police. Despite the absence of a buy bust operation, the police claims and makes up a story of a drug trade. Reports in the news declare the couple having been arrested through a buy-bust operation, when no buy-bust took place. They then divide the supposed fee of Nhorsida for running drugs for Amira, like spoils of war and leave only a small portion to be declared as marked money.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ziHDTYdyUsPKOKnpyR3P2NgVwDd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
