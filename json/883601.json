With Jessica in a seemingly failed marriage and Ryan carrying a secret he has kept from his family, the baggage they are packing is heavy. They end their exhausting journey south only to be greeted by their overbearing mother and her never-ending critique on their lives as she hides her own depression with a bottle of wine. However, Aunt Fran and Uncle John are ever present to add humor to the ailing situation. With laughter and tears, director William Tyler takes his audience deep into the recesses of a modern, Southern family's struggle to stay together during a time of separation and death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6xiuyNqgTbTjDo72KzfsPn3Ajdb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Long Drive Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
