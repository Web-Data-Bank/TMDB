Using the special case of continuous lateral movement created from filming from a moving train, the film trails and loops across the screen, revealing the passing landscape. Filmed from the passenger compartment of the Berlin Ring-Bahn, the extended vision of the scenery includes surreptitious graffiti, elongated buildings, and a spatially compressed, passing train. The musical accompaniment is constructed from the original audio and created through the manipulation of delay-effect frequencies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t5zhnTUYZlXf9bwOLtRFJaaGDts.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin Loops: Savignyplatz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
