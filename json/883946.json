Gargamore has kidnapped a bunch of the new cartoon characters and sent his live action henchmen (played by James Avery and Bill Saluga from Going Bananas) to stop the real live actors from making it onto the special. Gargamore wants to do this because the new Saturday morning line-up is funny and he's deathly allergic to laughter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laugh Busters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
