The official image of 1930-1950 is replaced by the memories of fellow villagers and relatives, and the view from the researcher's office is what the official memory of the storyteller looks like today. This is a film about a person, about time and about the fundamental subjectivity and limitations of our view of them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cvFYkSYpyK4JbLeaNtlt5iP8gqo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Singer of Tales","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
