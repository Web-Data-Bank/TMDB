We have found the perfect tool and limitless opportunities for observing and studying the Earth. How many amazing discoveries have been made since then thanks to scientific instruments raised into orbit. We found out where most of the oxygen we breathe actually comes from, how such powerful and dangerous natural phenomena as typhoons and hurricanes are formed, we looked deep underground and found fantastic processes there. And this is only the beginning, only the first steps in the holistic and systematic knowledge of this beautiful and mysterious space object.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t2RktdH3P5LWcxvDV3EOy00NHmq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Earth: Top Point","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
