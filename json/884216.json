Patrick Tarrant’s film juxtaposes excerpts from White magazines from the past century and mechanical voice-over segments of an online learning module on equality, inclusion and diversity for present-day employees. – Ji.hlava IDFF 2021  \"Mandatory Training is a slightly ornery reaction to being forced to complete computer-based training and tests on matters that range from the banal to the ideological. For better or worse, if you answer wrongly on a question relating to race or gender, for example, you can, as the module explains, keep repeating the test until you pass.\" – Patrick Tarrant","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nCPpNGw4UGvPmZmmEE2XCDSJZDf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mandatory Training","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
