We asked the young people who attend the youth groups of the National Trans Youth Network to bring us stories they want told: tales of the barriers that they’ve faced as trans and non-binary, but crucially also of how those barriers can be overcome with the right help and support. These stories then became the six parts of Incoming Transmissions, voiced by the young trans and non-binary people of NTYN.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incoming Transmissions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
