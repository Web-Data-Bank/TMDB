Jungeun Lee meets with them and hears their stories, and the six characters—Beer, Hanseo Oh, Jerry Ahn, Yeon, Yeonju Yoo, and Yogue—openly reveal themselves in front of the camera. The main topic is the overlapping identities of women, immigrants, and queers, and the experience of otherization resulting from those identities. Their confession seems to be summed up in a few keywords, but the 'better life' they think of extends in different directions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8sKEGuRFfwCQ88J3fm0gCnr6K7x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belonging Nowhere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
