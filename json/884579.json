One day, extraordinarily, Bia wakes up and causes a radical change in the lives of everyone around her. While she needs to relearn how to talk, walk and relate, her adult daughter, her ex-husband and his current wife will have to readjust to a new family configuration, much more complex and full of challenges.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dMXCXyeGyuzaQglU2XI9ZViYc36.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37488,"logo_path":"/xObLKIzR6jojWxCkGPMJdsXRDne.png","name":"Mira Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":89438,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox Brazil","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":49756,"logo_path":"/tdQjfoqkGV9JMFm5PWHhRioYxn3.png","name":"Querosene Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":11547,"logo_path":"/kyOeH5CwsaILcJItafIMAM4KElB.png","name":"Agência Nacional do Cinema - ANCINE","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":181087,"logo_path":"/1doJ1Sg6VVCietnJZC7Da38Uk1e.png","name":"Fundo Setorial do Audiovisual","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":197334,"logo_path":"/poEQXm0Ej4xjSYWDf93xBbo8Gco.png","name":"Banco Regional de Desenvolvimento do Extremo Sul","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She and I","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
