The voice is not subordinated to any rational order, avoiding an adaptation to semantic content or syntactic structures. The digital sounds metaphorically blur distinctions between what is heard as natural or artificial and reference the dynamism and ephemerality of environments and forms of life. An amorphous figure appears timidly in a familiar background. We cannot predict its movements or what is going to become. We cannot decode its gender, age, nationality, or mood. It doesn’t follow any law, it’s just there to exist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a9q1P6EMvVn5kVNCfavNCXuyZYY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Partial","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
