The banker gives Gus a ten-dollar bill, and Gus is so filled with gratitude that he sticks closer to the embezzler than glue, no matter where the robber goes. This eventually causes the apprehension of the worn-out robber. A policeman gives Gus a reward and Gus then turns his grateful attention to him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"},{"id":146463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paramount Cartoon Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1958-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grateful Gus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
