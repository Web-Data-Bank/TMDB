This is a film about parents and children: how trauma never leaves a family, and how hope and resilience is also passed down. It asks the question: Can a new generation look at the world with wonder rather than fear?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g5GY7RByH6FJang0pFhQmS1QnS4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14872,"logo_path":"/udD9q0nbMXvneV4lpqYcOR7om74.png","name":"Tisch School of the Arts (NYU)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An immigrant boy of the Depression era soars above his family's tragedies.","title":"40 Nickels","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
