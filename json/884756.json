In the chaos of events, thoughts, issues, routine and everyday rituals become a safe haven that protects us from asking ourselves questions about meaning, etc. Treatments around the body, obsession with beauty and youth, excessive health care give us the illusion of controlling time and body. Bursting, splitting, striking out, alienating is not the result of a symptom, a disease manifestation of its existence. This is just because there is a crack, split, alienating fission in human nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Xs8xOD8h6rqdIKf5i5p9PXIZ3K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Program: Bodism","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
