Drones have replaced all farmers, breeders, and shepherds. This has led to better hygiene standards, considerably fewer contagion risks, and more efficiency in agricultural monitoring. Even traditional small-scale farming has turned into fully automated animal production. Before this decision, closing city farms were considered, Gilles Amar sheepfold: La Bergerie des Malassis was threatened once again. But closing one more farm would have been a stain on the government's reputation. To correspond to its supposed ecological and green politics, the farm is saved but led by drones.  In drone exploitation, Gilles’ words are still written and seem to be the only trace of human-being.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4k8XFdrQ5oqnqHO4hm8UHq0nQ3f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do sheep dream of electric shepherds?","title":"Electric Shepherds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
