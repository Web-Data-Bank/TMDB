By shouting specific phrases and acting out a strict choreography, it is a way of paying respect to the deceased but also overcoming grief and pain over the loss of a loved one. Through the documentation of the re-enactment of the ritual, Zgjim Elshani seeks to recover fragments of the practice in the communities where this form of collective grieving is still a way of overcoming loss. By doing so, the project intends to rethink collective grieving and what it means to publicly display emotions in a male-headed society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qn8IOb6wh8jNzMv3Vb07A9oEPsI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"},{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gjama","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
