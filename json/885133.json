I created a live event in the television studio using an urban classroom of children and my films and videos. The sound was the childrenâ€™s spontaneous songs mixed with the repeated countdown of a rocket launching; the conversation between the astronauts and Mission Control and U.S. troops engaged in battle in the Vietnam War. This tape is shown as a non-scripted improvisation. The studio environment and the children were bombarded by media.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uNTGNACVs2UegVoEqdNQvDgGfUL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minus 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
