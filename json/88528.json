Lean, mean, and stylish as always, this tale of youth-gone-wild is both vibrant and touching. Suzuki contrasts tranquil glimpses of traditional regional life with the emergence of the new rock 'n' roll youth culture and the greed and seething cynicism of encroaching Westernism.  Also released under the title \"Go To Hell, Hoodlums!\", this is a melodrama as colorful, shocking, and exhilarating as one would come to expect from Japan's master filmmaker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5F9B3E8JWtKddua0pwesqfJ8rK5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":955,"logo_path":"/5xnXD3PJI1HqOJceSAKZ3fDqO1V.png","name":"Nikkatsu Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1960-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting Delinquents","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
