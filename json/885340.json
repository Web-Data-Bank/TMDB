It was shot entirely on a (then-new) Fisher Price PixelVision PXL2000 low-fidelity camcorder in monochrome on compact audio cassette, inspiring Richard Linklater to utilize the same technique in his 1991 feature SLACKER. The film recontextualizes Citizen Kane to provide some self-reflexive commentary on the filmmaker's status in the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fDc0cC8GZG820GkNb75hx4AC5ZN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen Yuppie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
