If thereâ€™s anyone out there to receive the message.  Isolated in a sealed apartment, a lone observer regards an outside world outside become increasingly unreal or unreachable. Archaic illuminations, old slides and the pin-lights of the camera obscura, crawl across the walls. Connections fray. Time loses meaning.  A science fictional essay film, or its inverse. A rumination on optics, memory, data, and endings.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/hqHJO5CmJNcV3NE2kysPb6UVpCH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light Leak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
