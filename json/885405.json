As Fox News Channel first reported, Civil War 2017 uncovers an extensive network of neo-Marxist operatives coordinating highly disruptive and potentially violent protests from coast to coast.  Working with Dangerous Documentaries, director Judd Saul and conservative commentator Trevor Loudon have compiled a team of researchers and undercover operatives to probe the roots of the anti-Trump movement, highlighting the ultimate goals and ulterior motives. Mr. Loudon, a regular contributor to Glenn Beck’s online programming, is the foremost expert on the left-wing organizers of mass protests.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2Kp9pJEYZSsiGlFYjbvoiQrMbFL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America Under Siege: Civil War 2017","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
