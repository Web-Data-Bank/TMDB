Nabulagala, the Kampala slum where they live, is populated with broken lives, crumbling homes, and bleak prospects. The sunâ€™s heat suppresses emotion. Dust from the red clay cakes every surface. Malaria-carrying mosquitoes jab at unprotected skin. Homemade alcohol, glue, and other drugs, substances that offer a brief reprieve from the misery, have turned people into empty shells that occupy the shadows of this slum. Day in and day out, the next generation of Ugandans must surmount these obstacles in order to begin thinking, dreaming and hoping about the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UG","name":"Uganda"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drinking from the Well","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
