He wanted to accomplish the impossible: run 75 consecutive marathons in 75 consecutive days to bring attention to the incredibly difficult lives of single-parent families. He ran in spite of freezing rain and unbearable heat, in spite of chest pains and bone fractures that wracked his 57-year-old body. He just kept running - each day, every day - strengthening an unbreakable bond between father and son--- not stopping until he broke the finish line tape in Atlanta. MY RUN is more than a film about a guy running multiple marathons; it's a film about the daily marathons we all run in life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Run","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
