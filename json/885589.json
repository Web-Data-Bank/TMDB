As her ex-husband takes their daughter and her nagging mother to the countryside, she prepares for a laidback evening with her friends. Soon she comes to realize she lost her cell phone which prevents her from receiving a much awaited call from her previous night's stand. Her friends, Iulia, Andrei and Marius, arrive and try to watch a movie. The screening is frequently interrupted by an increasingly annoying and rather absurd dialogue that takes place between the thief/finder of the cell phone and Ana.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qi0Kk6JxIzq7hUhxqhA8zrXHYfL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51274,"logo_path":null,"name":"42 Km Film","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":162710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umbrela Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2010-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Belly of the Whale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
