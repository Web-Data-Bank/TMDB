Remote tribes around the world struggle to adapt to the intrusions of the Western civilization. This film brings forward tribes scattered on 5 continents: the San of the Kalahari Desert, the native tribes from the Amazonian forest, the Inuit from the Arctic polar circle, the Pygmies of the Congo rain forest, the indigenous of the Vanuatu archipelago and the Hmong tribes from Northern Vietnam. Their contact with the white civilization throughout history followed the way of violence and the way of abandonment. 16 years ago, someone found another way: A Third Way to reach tribes. This is the story of a new approach and communication between civilizations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AuIUmaCMgzYTEKPyUCOOkdGBSs3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BW","name":"Botswana"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GY","name":"Guyana"},{"iso_3166_1":"NA","name":"Namibia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"},{"iso_3166_1":"CG","name":"Congo"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Third Way to Reach Remote Tribes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
