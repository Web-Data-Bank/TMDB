Aad and Ron, who are taking care of no less than six foster children, are confronted by this bigotry almost every day. Things become more harrowing when the father of the multi-handicapped Michael (8), who has been living for almost his entire life with the two men, obstructs adoption on account of the homosexual proclivity of the foster fathers. TWEE VADERS candidly documents one year in the life of Aad and Ron and their foster children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eamfcVootp7xEJ785FRJCrbPyrK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Dads","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
