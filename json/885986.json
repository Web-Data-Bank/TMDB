Alone in the house he is attracted by the sound of a cell phone. Augusto finds the cell phone forgotten by his teenage son at home. A series of messages attract his attention, they are those of Trilly99, a young user of the social network MatchUp. Trillly99 proposes a game: she will start sending photos of small details of herself and he will have to replicate in the same way. Intrigued Augusto decides to play along but it will not be easy for her to hide her true age. He dresses in his son's t-shirt, shaves his chest, hides wrinkles and a white beard behind a Wrestler mask and spreads his wife's body oil. How far will this grotesque ploy in search of the perfect photo push our Pater familias 2.0?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4mHu0xOT2QIaUvs82U2R3syiDKc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pater Familias","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
