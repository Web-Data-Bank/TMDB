Hildegard has brought the art of sound walking to groups around the world, and she has formulated a deep feminist ecology rooted in the body. The film offers a place for the viewer to listen, the necessary precondition for personal and societal change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Listening","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
