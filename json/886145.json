These travels started a series of records, articulated in a kind of travel log in the style of a modern Marco Polo. This film moves between the gaze of the filmmaker and that of the tourist, at the same time it revitalizes the question for the other in a globalized age, with omnipresent screens. In this posthumous film, Ospina casts his regard on small details, be it common habits or exceptional events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2JhEML4ixUCb1sJ3MEdLwfWnRRj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eye of the Tourist: XIII Easy Pieces","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
