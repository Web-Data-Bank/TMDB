These works explore proprioception (sense of body position) & kinesthesia (sense of body movement), as meeting points between painting, poetry, voice & improvised music. Guided by intuition, & bypassing a range of traditional inhibitions, Peyrafitte investigates the porosity of her own conscious- and unconscious-ness with, as tangible aim & outcome, a strong desire to reveal the immanent “soul” of that moment. Most often the markings are done with the feet, either in hand-stand or head-stand, and/or with mouth-sprayed charcoals or other natural pigments — hands are rarely used to mark, except for smaller formats.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mg6DeKiBLmwMwDZOj4DGgM6UpBV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karstic Action: I de-suffice myself in confinement","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
