In a tiny mountain town with no road in – and no road out – a community carries secrets of all sizes. But when a young woman with ambition and intelligence collides with a pastor deeply committed to preserving the status quo, cracks begin to appear in the town’s well-constructed façade. And when a stranger appears with a mysterious backstory and the best moonshine anyone’s ever tasted – some of those secrets threaten to spill. With an original folk-country score, this modern-day myth inspired by local lore promises to leave audiences on the edge of their seats.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/42l9V0xj0wtR8MHnBypgdopNY28.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162831,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alliance Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darlin' Cory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
