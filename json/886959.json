After a few minutes the characters dry out and disappear. Almost everyday she comes here and practices her handwriting with her friends and colleagues. Together they have lively discussions about the strokes and shapes—amongst each other and with the many spectators. Hú Zhǎng Zū is the only woman within the turmoil of men, and due to her high writing art she is respected and highly admired. I come back to see her often, in order to learn from her and capture these ephemeral moments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k9f3LGbwqriiW5J6k2t2hvETE0f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2021-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Characters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
