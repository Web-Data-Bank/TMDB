She would later describe her method as “fragments of reality assembled in an unusual manner”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlinfever – Wolf Vostell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
