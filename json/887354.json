With a fair share of sensitive emotions and anthemic bops, In Pieces reflects on the romantic journeys of eight individuals, as they share, ponder and look back on the chosen paths and partners along the way. Set in New York City, there’s the scary excitement of being vulnerable and saying yes to whatever adventure is ahead. The magical first kiss. An unlikely friendship. Well-kept secrets. The monotony. The rebound. An awkward reunion on the 1 train. And the honest conversations of deserving more. All these pieces of a life that at times connect and disconnect, but once at a distance, come together to create a universal remembrance of what it’s like to be young and learning in love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y2QFjngKokq4Lbka5atXJrmokwl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Future Spotlight Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Pieces","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
