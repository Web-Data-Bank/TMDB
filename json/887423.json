Baltic German engineer Gunnar Haase, initially a refugee, arrived in Finnish Lapland in 1945 to repair the destruction left by the Germans. Antti’s father Hannu continued grandfather Gunnar’s mission to bring electricity to Lapland – the powerlines finally reaching the very last Lapland home on the 23th July,1987. Rural electrification was an enormous undertaking; it brought modern life and equality to people still living in the harsh nature. And while the undertaking took a heavy toll, it also illuminated the way forward. The Illuminators is an inspiring story about courage and social progress as well as sons following in their father’s footsteps.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tgjK6VMtlEmMLqJpZrSulxqRjiy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illume","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2017-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a Baltic German refugee who became Lapland’s father of light","title":"The Illuminators","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
