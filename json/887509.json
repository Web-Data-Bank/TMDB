In the installation, two images are projected onto a single screen, and the border between the two images becomes an imaginative site for visual and contextual exchange. Scenes of two girls playing a duet on the piano interact with scenes of two women conversing about memory. As the video progresses, subjects disappear into the “no space” gluing the two images together.\" -The Studio Museum in Harlem","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
