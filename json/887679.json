You can see boring interviews in other places, but not here. Enjoy, or wince, at drunken conversations with Arkona, Darkthrone, Dimmu Borgir, Enslaved, King Diamond, Arch Enemy, Septic Flesh, Primordial, Alestorm, Enthroned, Kreator, Voivod, Tyr, and Ensiferum. Join Bill Zebub and maidens of metal. No other journalists have the guts, the creativity, or the love of fun. And when you're done with 2 hours of mayhem, sit back and enjoy the #1 metal comedy aptly called \"Metalheads\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/abOHNnJmz6PVgxnWS2mCFvNBIRo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Extreme Metal Retardation","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
