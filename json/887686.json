This is not meant as a “What is Black Metal?” type of documentary because the only people who are interested in black metal are fans of black metal. Seriously. As such, there is no rehashing of the same thing that has been printed in magazines for years (mostly lies). If you are the type of idiot who watches a documentary just so you can see things that you already know, then please kill yourself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dnIanfPU6tmOWBTeyQgNo4Rc1Rh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":360,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Metal: The Ultimate Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
