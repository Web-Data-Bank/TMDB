That the police are roaming the streets, telling people to stay indoors. That the streets are silent and empty. That our relationships are tested with the simple inevitability of being together 24/7 in the same space. We all experienced something, whether it be painful or reflective, but it changed us. An international phone line was opened and people left messages reflecting their feelings, thoughts and experiences. 22 filmmakers from 15 countries united to make a visual-philosophical documentary of isolation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jYkzjo1QYoGnU879wf3ZJzeZ5M0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ettevaatlik Sten","origin_country":""},{"id":164655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kafka Films","origin_country":""},{"id":165071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pink Llama","origin_country":""},{"id":28110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Communication University of China Television Production Centre","origin_country":""},{"id":165072,"logo_path":null,"name":"SomeNobody productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"JO","name":"Jordan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
