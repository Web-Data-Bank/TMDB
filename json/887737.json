Their intimate confession is not just a demonstration of a free relationship between three people. The lovers, who have intimate conversations, sing, tease each other, or remain silent together, give a glimpse into the life of a social unit that takes questions of trust and tolerance to extremes. A polyamorous relationship can sometimes be even more solid than a couple because it goes beyond the familiar. It represents an experimental space where safe boundaries are abandoned and a gateway is opened to a frighteningly unrestrained universe where established patterns of behavior do not apply. It is a chance to free oneself from inner demons and be renewed within. To find ourselves, we must first lose ourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roof of Leaves","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
