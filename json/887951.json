Filmed over the last few years with the super 8 Ektachrome reels gifted by Katherina Thomadaki, it has been conceived either as four individual portraits, two diptychs or one single film. Within and between the glimpes of these women there also emerges a self-portrait of myself through my love for those who have shaped me, and an homage to the cinema of Klonaris and Thomadaki.  ipsae i/ii is a diptych comprised of ipsae (abi) and ipsae (guillermina), which explores intergenerational identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3GHlietzg6McFGOB5RFg2v3o54V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ipsae i/ii","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
