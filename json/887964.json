Each woman sells what she has gathered for construction material. But the river is more than a place to work. It is a place to bathe, wash clothes, laugh and tell stories. \"Fossil\" is a collaborative performance piece crated by David Bronstein, Debbie Crowell, Ed Mitchell, Lynne Sachs, and Gede Tjok. The dance evolved through discussion and movement exercises as a collective response to the images from Mambai. This project was supported by an artist-in-residence grant from Downtown Community Television (New York, NY).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fossil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
