In the fight against his arch-enemy James Lee, he lands in the future through a cleverly used time jump and must fight his way through the city of Möllenhafen, which is occupied by crow people and ninjas. But he is assisted by the old general Gio Pescie and his niece Käthe Pescie. Together, the three concoct an insidious plan, with the help of the now retired Martin Lee, to find his son James and bring him to justice. Because Braddog is primarily about one thing: revenge and retribution by any means! Is there an escape from the horrible future hell?!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ptVnORHqMZxNqbnkHHuuMnJzgGI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74219,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.U.
