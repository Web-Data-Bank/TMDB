Melanie claims that many of the things that have happened to Cry Baby are similar to the things that have happened in her own life, mixed in with fantasy elements. Each song on the tracklist is titled something childhood related, while the actual message being crossed to the listener carries more adult-like themes and problems.","popularity":1.139,"poster_path":"/beusIWga87KmP8iQYUvMw07RIjk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166662,"logo_path":null,"name":"NEVERSLEEP","origin_country":""},{"id":166663,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAD Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":65827,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantic Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They call me Cry Baby.","title":"Cry Baby","video":true,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
