Trying to understand the young generation’s viewpoint and to capture the end of cinema as we know if, Klepnikov wildly chases and captures visual and auditive input, which he combines into a film sketchbook consisting of fragments of the lives of young people who apparently have been through the end of the world, but who still have many years ahead of them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/49zn64mcEnh1YrBkbhIkgAOY1lm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6719,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAUR film","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Preparations for Film T","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
