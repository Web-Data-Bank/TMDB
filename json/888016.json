Through Nant, a young, first-time protester, we meet three human rights activists whose lives have been turned upside down by the coup. As the protests continue, Nant comes to understand the truth of a brutal regime that has continued to wage war against its own people for decades. Against a foreboding backdrop, Nantâ€™s political awakening regarding the plight of others in her ethnically diverse country gives hope for the future.  Beautifully augmented by poetry and art, Padauk: Myanmar Spring shows the resilience and determination of the people of Myanmar, and the sacrifices they've made.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/44t0yy958tOl1t0sbQYNIZdTp7X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Padauk: Myanmar Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
