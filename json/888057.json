The heart of the show is an ABC television special featuring live performances of \"Toxic,\" \"Breathe on Me,\" and \"I'm a Slave 4 U.\" A fun highlight is Spears's hip-hop collaboration with the Ying Yang Twins on \"(I Got That) Boom Boom,\" one of the few numbers in the star's stage repertoire with a little room for spontaneity. Between songs one finds Spears gushing over her grandfather, praising her entourage, describing the emotional toll of being in the public eye, and writing songs.","popularity":1.791,"poster_path":"/pBgyrj11lPAjmJdM7s24eucOyL6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fairy Zone Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":162989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greg Sills Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1756,"logo_path":"/d7YyNzysIF0lSb4lJRf1ar6MHxi.png","name":"Broadway Video","origin_country":"US"},{"id":77902,"logo_path":null,"name":"Company 3","origin_country":""},{"id":8421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Post Factory Films","origin_country":""},{"id":161819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cyclope Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ABC Television Special","title":"Britney Spears: In The Zone","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
