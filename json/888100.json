It wavers between spontaneous, even raw film, and conceptual performance. A \"heretical mass\" of four interpenetrating parts in color (Closure, Pilgrimage, Home, Cemetery), which define typically Deml motifs. The fifth part, in high contrast black and white, is a reaction to the illusion of a colorful world, a voice from the graveyard that frames the eternally absurd human quest for immortality.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Purgatory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
