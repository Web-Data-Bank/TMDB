The Kinloss is one of the largest ships in the Danish Maersk Line's fleet of tankers, which traverses the world's oceans and handles the global circulation of goods. The filmmaker shot the tons of steel moving between Busan and Shenzhen as both a wasteland inhabited by a few human beings and an industrial monument to the cold beauty and helplessness of the advanced phase of consumer capitalism. Fragments of cabins, decks, engines, massive ropes and breathtaking views of the sea complement the depersonalised narratives of a cosmopolitan line-up of employees of the world's largest transport corporations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinloss","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
