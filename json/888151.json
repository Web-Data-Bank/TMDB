She captured her ten-year-long journey to recovery, which took her deep into the past and to the edge of the abyss, in the form of a personal and poetic video diary. With her weakened kidneys, she visited doctors, psychosomatic experts, and an alternative healer who urged her to surrender herself into the hands of God. Gradually, she began to see the condition of her dual organs as a reflection of her unbalanced relationship with her mother, her partner, and her own body. She finally understood that if she wanted to find a cure for her diseased kidneys and start living a better life, she needed to understand herself better first.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n64CsHYnCRaYMXjFNzj7ITbWC9S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gnomon Production","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Healing Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
