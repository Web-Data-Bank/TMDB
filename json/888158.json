The term Animot was taken over from Jacque Derrida. While the French philosopher and deconstructivist uses the term to refer to everything animalistic and non-human, the film, on the other hand, uses intimate details to point out the proximity between human beings and animals. They are connected by their vulnerability, helplessness and mortality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7OjQVAFOrVUB5otraus2JjP8DCk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
