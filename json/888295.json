Using archival aerial photographs, microscopic videography and data mapping, this work documents how aquatic life has persisted despite intense industrialization. Earlier phases of development transformed the Port Lands into a human-built space for economic activity without regard for negative impacts on the existing environment. Evidence of this disregard persists in new so-called \"revitalization\" plans in which the water, land and inhabitants are conceived not as a living ecosystem but as data points to be optimized in a high-tech urban landscape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/811X0CmNeVW2ErjkfuSRLgCR0qY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Port Lands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
