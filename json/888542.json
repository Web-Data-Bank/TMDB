In the meantime, the entire adult population in the whole world (including their father) died from an unknown illness. The only thing that remained of him was several reels of exposed film. The children were left alone in the world. With no future, no faith, no hope... A self-therapeutic film from a beautiful era when most people disappeared behind the walls of their homes and were afraid to come out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uww7Z0zKODAa4Iz6iFhHv93eDCP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Killer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
