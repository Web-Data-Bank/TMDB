Mother Nature is slowly dying; and she’s screaming softly and whispering loudly about humankind and how it has grown out of touch with its forest identity. But an emergency team of tree ninjas comes to the rescue. They resurrect ancient rituals and help fuel the fire of ancient wisdom to ignite a glimmer of hope. People must reinvent themselves, branch out, and grow internally. Only then can our blue planet become green again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And What If?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
