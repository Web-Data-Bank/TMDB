Tailspin features Ethan Marc as a \"greaser\" who wants more from life. His job at the local diner is going nowhere and he constantly has to contend with snobbish \"socs\" who come in to be waited on. His main attraction is for pretty boy Jeff White who seems totally disinterested. So Ethan decides on having a good old time on the griddle with one of the boys after hours, giving him a nice order of sausage. Ethan looks great and his acting has improved considerably. The flick plays out as a standard boy-loses-boy, boy-regains-boy with some notable sex scenes thrown in. Maybe too vanilla for some tastes, the photography, score and set design contribute to make this a keeper.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3HFrZWQiFjRRBCNgzkYlNoCQ1Ai.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111582,"logo_path":"/lv7W9er923HNeSbVYwQBYtHjd6i.png","name":"Studio 2000","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tailspin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
