The film evokes different types of Stalin worship, from the individual to the collective one, and depicts a highly heterogeneous set of exhibits at a French exhibition in tribute to Stalin. Banned for commercial and non-commercial distribution in France, the film won the Best Short Film Screenplay award at the 1950 Karlovy Vary Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man We Love the Most","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
