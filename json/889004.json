He added an overpainting to the film, respecting the actions of the protagonists so that the characters would react to the coloured flying objects. Pilař made the untitled material into a video screener called A Film Sketch 1965 (ca. 1984), and later edited it with video effects under the title Painting into the Air (ca. 1991).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painting into the Air","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
