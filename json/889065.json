But occasionally some visitors come to her flat. Through them and the voice of Antonio López (Dream of Light, Víctor Erice), the only painter who remembers her, we shape a multifaceted film. This is a cinematic portrait, which well into the film takes a surprising turn. A film that reflects on memory and oblivion, art and the creative process; posing the question of what it means to be an artist and a woman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mWZmW7fzvOtDwTCuktWOBoIeNNA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56548,"logo_path":null,"name":"59 en Conserva","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":133965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cedro Plátano","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Visit and a Secret Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
