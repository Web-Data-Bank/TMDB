This cabinet is the only location in the film. It seems that they are in the cabinet, like they are closed, separated from others, even from the other journalists. It’s a slow and minimalistic film. It’s not a film about one specific journalistic research; this film presents a monotonous and nervous atmosphere in this cabinet. The boundaries between truth and falsehood begin to overlap, journalists experience the betrayal of a colleague, the office becomes sweltering and unpleasant.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/juQdupupP6V8NQdvtV5vMUOcQ2q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cabinet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
