Recorded over five years in New York City, Berlin, Barcelona, Athens, New Orleans, Rome, Paris, Havana, Madrid, Budapest and Marseille.

And a testament to the ethos of always carrying a camera even when you don’t know why.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5zJRqFSfrMNKqEBW2RoPPWebPFe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flutter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
