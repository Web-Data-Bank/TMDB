Now I am left with the memory of a word which I cannot find in the dictionary. The closest word I can find to \"teleomeric\" is \"telomeric,\" meaning belonging to the telomeres, or the ends of the chromosome, which protect their information and prevent them from sticking together. In this sense, the film is actually about the search for those rare moments of consolidation that keep us afloat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g8qE50DPepUPzr9awxUvSA5Bsxd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keeping Together in Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
