Predominant darkness. Only a few small lights cast shadows and slightly enlighten the surroundings. Shattering noises of machines and tools in use. Dust is in the thin air, and rocks keep coming loose. The atmosphere is menacing, suspenseful and at the same time fascinating. Like moles, the small miners are digging ever deeper into the mountains. The soil of the Namib is an essayistic 360Â° documentary in three chapters about illegal mining in Namibia, contextualized with historic colonialism and contemporary economic globalization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Soil of the Namib","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
