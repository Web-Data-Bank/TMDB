Through young Eliana, the director's alter ego, we follow the story of burnout, work retraining and healing of a human soul using radical forms of therapeutic strategies. Everyday life blends into the reality of dream spaces – “emotional incubators”, where the individual becomes collective. And the film becomes a part of the personal journey of the author as well as a hero of the story. We are situated in Berlin, representing the generic and business area of metropolitan cities in Europe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Not Your Fault","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
