Academics for Peace have been criminalized and put on trial with the charge of terrorist propaganda. A Defense portrays one of the Academics for Peace while preparing for her upcoming appearance in court in 2019. A psychodrama is put on stage in a house, where the person is both the state, the judge, the academic and the cook. Itâ€™s a self-portrait on the violence and absurdity of the ways in which the state sneaks into the house of an academic, forcing her to adjust her words, body and gestures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Defense","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
