They appear to be in a complete void. The camera films the runners from all kinds of angles: sometimes from the front, from the knees up, then in profile or a focus on one of the limbs in close up. The heavy breathing of their exertions is audible. The tight close-ups of the limbs lend the moving body parts an almost abstract, mechanical character.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k1MvjrgYcL1L7JGEIwJhqpy3YIg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pursuit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
