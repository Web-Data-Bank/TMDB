Music and images have rarely been so close in their perception of time. The film follows three movements in three different interiors with three different songs moving under the camera. While our gaze circles in those intimate spaces, the rooms become alive. Light and cats move, shadows appear, and the wind tells of eternal possibilities we may discover if we just open our eyes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
