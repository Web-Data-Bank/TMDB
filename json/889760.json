It drafts the notion of new feminist historiographies by tracing histories unwritten and by opening to date uncharted archives: at the core of its narrative resides Lonzi’s unfnished project on Les Précieuses, a French proto-feminist group active in the 17th century. It is this project our flm wants to revisit in an attempt to complete it in a speculative manner, thereby connecting a remote part of the feminist history with possible feminist futures. Adjacently, a tentative lineage in feminist thought towards the present is mapped through a re staging of an iconic photographic volume titled La strada più lunga by feminist photographer Maria Grazia Chinese from 1975 in the garden of the Casa Internazionale delle Donne in Rome.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It is at This Point That the Need to Write History Arises","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
