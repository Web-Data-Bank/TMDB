Her apparently orderly life hides a secret : when she was young, she gave birth to a child of whom she could  not take care. Years later, when she tried to find him, she was told a lie, that his file did not exist anymore. She has continued looking for him ever since. While searching, Vera leads a double life : she takes on jobs in the underworld, working for crime organizations, as a way of fighting the system that betrayed her. Cora (52) is a piano teacher living in San Sebasti√°n who dedicated her life to taking care of her adoptive son, Egoz (19). Egoz is about to leave home and start his own independent life, far away. Vera lost her son and spent all her life looking for him. Cora fears losing hers. Reescritura is an encounter between these two women during which they tell each other their life stories and imagine other possible destinies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Re-Writing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
