Female animals are banned too, except for cats, songbirds and insects. Throughout the film women discuss a place they have no access to and their ideas and points of view interconnect and take us all the way to the forbidden land. Since the female duo that directs Avaton is unable to visit the peninsula, they decide to reconstruct Athos by using material filmed anywhere but there, animations and reworked archival material.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5ftKzqKm183xdS3cWVwkNVLGeaL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/x5m947rMvwJbNpoGil5W76dIJjB.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avaton","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
