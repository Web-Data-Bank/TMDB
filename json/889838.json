Directed by Anderson Bellini and produced and scripted by Thiago Rahal Mauro, the document had it starting point in a long interview where Andre Matos spoke for over 5 hours about all sort of different subjects. With his sudden passing in 2019, the family yielded this material as well as hundreds of other ones from his personal archives so that this film could be finalized.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/fthRn3Avd3BitVt0OHoaxnOfbDn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185263,"logo_path":"/1H2YwG0rvzjB9vsmOpbwEq4YMqe.png","name":"Anderson Bellini Image \u0026 Sound","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andre Matos - Maestro of Rock","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
