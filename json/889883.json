After coming to New York in the 90's to enter seminary, Vince dropped out to follow his second calling - music. With his band The Love Choir, he has played a now legendary weekly residency for over twenty years. Reconnecting with his faith and using his intense soulful music, he began to preach a type of spirituality that meets people where they are, is open to everyone, and moves every single person that sees him play. Reverend Vince is deeply involved in social activism, working with other progressive Christians at home and around the country to build inclusive communities. Filmed over four years in a largely observational style and featuring Questlove and members of TV On The Radio, THE REVEREND is a stirring concert film as well as an intimate portrait of Reverend Vinceâ€™s inspiring personal and spiritual life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5deIQXEWJ18v1is3hhGWs13tQ6t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Reverend","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
