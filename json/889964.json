Its form changes depending on the circumstance as well as by the personas that alternate and define it. It is not necessarily presented as a literal intoxication but also as an emotional one. The subject experiences a communion, a spiritual encounter that co-exists with a rapture, the division of the soul, its departure from the Sensible World. The individual limits fade away, the subjects lose their outlines and their privacy; they cling to a dissimilarity that lacks a specific shape. The body turns into a place of observation, its pulse, its signs and its facial expressions recorded. As every state of influence and intoxication evolves, it registers on the body, leaving its mark behind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eT1YMnOigl3uhBrqofWo6kjyULx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rausch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
