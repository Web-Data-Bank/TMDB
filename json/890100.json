State of Emergency wants to recreate this strange video-game reality. The film is an attempt to save a place in time: to describe it, and to remember it. Our current present — our own state of emergency, the Covid-19 pandemic — began more than a year ago, and no one knows how long it will last. The main markers of this new reality are isolation and distance. In the film, we see a virtual city has become like time itself, a labyrinth that is endless and uncertain. Meanwhile, lines from a diary collect the disparate thoughts accumulated over the course of a month.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":163267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chai Khana","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"State of emergency","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
