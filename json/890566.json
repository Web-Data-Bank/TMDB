The man is being interviewed by another man, with both roles played by the artist, Kuba Dorabialski. The interview is conducted in a fictional Pan-Slavic language devised from an ‘irrational’ mix of Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Serbo-Croat and Bulgarian. The conversation of the two men starts formally, but quickly devolves into a rumination on social responsibility, sincerity, and the limits of language. It ends in an ecstatic pseudo-mystical dance and an introduction to a pair of angels: representatives of 1917 and 1991; bookends of the Eastern European 20th century socialist project.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invocation Trilogy 1: Floor Dance of Lenin’s Resurrection","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
