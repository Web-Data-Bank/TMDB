Nandin, Yineth, Rosario and Débora are some of the members of the Wigudun Galu group, whose name refers to an Omeggid entity from Guna mythology. They define themselves as a separate group, and their demands are specific to that group. They seek visibility, and their fight is arduous, as they are indigenous, they are trans and they are Omeggids. Broken down inside and outside your community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7QOdXBFTYVl3ugUpfqI6L0rfC4h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bananeira Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"PA","name":"Panama"}],"release_date":"2021-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wigudun, Alma de Dos Espíritus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
