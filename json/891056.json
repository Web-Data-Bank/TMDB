At the head of the school is a fearless principal, Robert DeBlois, who as a quadriplegic knows something about overcoming adversity. If the word \"inspiring\" gets overused, it rarely feels as apt as when watching DeBlois apply his tough love educational techniques on hardened teens. We watch three students - America, Jason and Yazmine - as they struggle through a make-or-break year, drawing upon conviction, pride and humor in order to survive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can 180 Days Change a Lifetime?","title":"Accelerating America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
