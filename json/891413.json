She is a Przewalski's horse: the only true wild horse species of the world. Although the origin of this endangered species is in Mongolia, Dot lives in the heart of Europe, on the grassy plains of Hungary called the \"Puszta\". 25 years ago some were introduced here and the horses instantly formed an organic connection with this magical land with rich and unique wildlife. Today this is one of the largest Przewalski's horse herds on the planet. This is their story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m69Eyj9UehsCiRJT65rubrz1w3T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86718,"logo_path":"/ed1P6FJC7L1vxRaETzV2P546uOH.png","name":"Doclights","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":13213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Azara Film Kft.","origin_country":""},{"id":164110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vadló Film Produkció","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2021-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Horses - A Tale From The Puszta","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
