The filmmaker, named after her aunt who was reported missing in the 80s, revisits a family wound that never had the chance to heal. She makes the journey to Colombia, her parents’ homeland, searching for the remains of her aunt who fought in the civil war and whose story is shrouded in mystery. The journey sheds light on an emblematic woman, whom Gisela never had the chance to meet; meanwhile, the film shatters the silence that was forced on her family and on all those denied the possibility of burying their dead.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sous le Silence et la Terre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
