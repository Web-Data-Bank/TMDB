The film provides a glimpse inside a festive cultural gathering; the workshop of a meticulous artisan; and an alley where a young cyclist is learning to ride. With her restrained approach, the filmmaker hints little by little at a seemingly inevitable transformation, while the relentless onset of gentrification threatens the social fabric of a neighbourhood. After a critically acclaimed detour into audio documentary, Jenny Cartwright returns to the evocative force of images to evoke a rich and diverse community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g4mBZTM7KfPZVVG2v9ONoyNT5h3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Je me souviens d'un temps où personne ne joggait dans ce quartier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
