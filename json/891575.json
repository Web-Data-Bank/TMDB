Marie, Ontario, a truss arch bridge straddles the St. Marys River, linking Canada to the United States. But underneath the bridge, a kind of liminal space exists where the notion of borders is blurred. With a wild yet carefully controlled energy, this deconstructed work transports us to the curious site where, it seems, anything is possible. Somewhere between an autobiographical piece, a heartfelt tribute to an immigrant mother whose fate is out of her hands, and a dance film rich in poetry and symbolism, this ode to freedom bubbles with reflections and experimentations – all set against the imposing backdrop of factory chimneys.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rinf9rF5uYukAG0iabMfZiKcSVU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Truss Arch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
