Defending champion Jackie Stewart had retired from racing, creating a power vacuum that sucked a host of racers, old and new, into the battle for the Championship.  And what a season! Predicting the outcome of each race was impossible as the drivers battled to come to terms with closer racing brought about by faster cars with better tyres. It was reliability as much as driving skill that kept the leaderboard in a state of constant flux. By the final race of the season Emerson Fittipaldi (McLaren), Clay Regazzoni (Ferrari) and Jody Scheckter (Tyrrell) were locked in a fascinating three-way battle for the title. It went right down to the wire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zhS7LYavvSCVIuvBsg5pKSCTNeD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"F1 Review 1974 Down to the last lap","title":"1974 FIA Formula One World Championship Season Review","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
