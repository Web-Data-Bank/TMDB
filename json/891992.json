With Atrophy Portraits we break down the layers of constructed perfection. These films are an exploration of power and submission, how the boundaries between those roles might initially seem fixed but can be more fluid. What it means to be the subject, to be observed and to meet that gaze.  This film is a portrait, designed to be watched on a portrait screen, for example your phone. A portrait needs a frame and our screens are our frames.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sBOpnGyKJCZfRYeNkN6ZuG25MFJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atrophy Portraits III","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
