A Dragonfly couple struggle with co-dependency; she's literally on top of him. A Grasshopper, addicted to coffee, is so jumpy, he launches himself in mid-sentence. A Praying Mantis who doesn't pray because she thinks she is God. A terrified Spider is deathly afraid of -- spiders. And, a perfectly-camouflaged Stick Bug complains that no one ever \"sees\" him. Throughout all this, Citronella battles her urge to flee - while Dr. Pill implores her to share her \"embarrassing\" problem.","popularity":0.625,"poster_path":"/f6m8pMBOE2O9JVS6U9WPtFmyBMX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Citronella Stories, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's okay to not be okay!","title":"Bug Therapy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
