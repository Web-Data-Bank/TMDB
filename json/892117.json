This experimental, narrative-led speculative fiction follows an exchange of internal letters between two protagonists who imagine one another across parallel dimensions. Each communicates to an envisioned other, who exists as a possibility beyond their self-perceived boundaries of reality, and these two beings meet in a shared world of imagination. In this reciprocal reach for the unknown, a world that bears an uncanny resemblance to our contemporary reality – colonised by Western capitalist constructs of race, gender and class, and characterised by a collective distance from Ta – opens a portal to another realm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ya2NOEAGLdzNL3zVh0DqHUZNsyE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(Tending) (To) (Ta)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
