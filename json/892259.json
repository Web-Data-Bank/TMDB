But they're not alone...As the studly guests' strip and shower, an Evil Presence watches and steals their clothes! Awakened by screams and eerie noises, the guys' reality turns into a naked nightmare of stalking zombies, fight crazed monsters, graveyard ghouls, and ghosts in the attic. Thrill to the exciting naked action as these buffed-out boys collectively flex their bare muscular bodies to deter these devilish demons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qBQ245aX4i7rEqw7sL1hgKUS7Ld.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53300,"logo_path":"/yH4RWWRJ7g7141njV9hA6c3bEVD.png","name":"Sharpshooter Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who will survive, the Beauties or the Beasts?","title":"Hunks on Haunted Hill","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
