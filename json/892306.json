He is smart, but is also a compulsive liar with vision problems and wears eyeglasses that don't quite remedy his weakened eyesight. To gain the respect of his fellow classmates, he ventures inside a haunted house right in front of the school, one that all the kids are afraid to enter. Inside, he finds a solitary old man who's hiding from the world. A friendship and apprenticeship are born between the boy and the old man, initiating a journey of self-discovery that lies at the very heart of this light-hearted drama.","popularity":0.633,"poster_path":"/mN5VNo60k47Ap2DrdjhMYBXEjho.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lagoonie Film Production","origin_country":"EG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"2021-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Extracurricular","video":false,"vote_average":7.929,"vote_count":7}
