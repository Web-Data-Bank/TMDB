The film is, in a way, the memory of a journey and a transition. This is the recording of how Jon Ander, born in Bermeo and used to the countryside life, decides to move to Bilbao and establish a relation with the city from his home. A small story to immerse ourselves in the idea that individual normality is a fabricated idea, as happens with traditions, systems and cities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harria eta bidea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
