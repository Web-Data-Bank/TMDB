Loneliness is also her life. One night, Amine, in a panic, seeks help at her house: Kimmy has fallen badly when she slipped and she has killed herself. Thinking that the police will not believe this version because of his judicial past, Amine borrows Constance's car to take the corpse and make it disappear. In the days that follow, this shared secret brings Constance and Amine closer. But one morning, an anonymous letter accompanied by photos demands a ransom: someone in the building has seen everything, the blackmail begins.","popularity":1.066,"poster_path":"/zLywsZpT1jk2ZcNpY5IIpyOaSzT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6300,"logo_path":"/5TBU2ucl0rZqP417gF5GZ7LTyF8.png","name":"Septembre Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Constance aux enfers","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
