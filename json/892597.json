Behind the facade, however, is a man trapped by his surroundings and falling ever behind in the pursuit of his life's dream. Not strong enough to confront his father's expectations, he left his true love, his best friend and his vision of life in small town America, and set off on a legal career—intent to, one day, return. Now the rising star in Washington social circles, and the youngest Managing Partner in the history of a powerhouse DC law firm, he is given the choice—continue the path of success in a life to which he never aspired, or return to the community that raised him.","popularity":3.478,"poster_path":"/d1HYgRGnemx5eQzsv091qpSHQyP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163605,"logo_path":null,"name":"AVA Independent","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes you have to take the long way home.","title":"The Road to Galena","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
