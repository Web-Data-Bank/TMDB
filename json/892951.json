Their gatherings provide a cozy, safe space for these young people in a society that’s not known for embracing its LGBTQ+ community. Discrimination, exclusion, and violence are part of the daily reality for these sports enthusiasts and their friends, whether on the streets or, in some cases, within the family. When they’re together, they find the love, warmth, and safety they need to fully be themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nUMIW7eve1d2iiy4sdCsPFIBO5R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163671,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jashi Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2021-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How the Room Felt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
