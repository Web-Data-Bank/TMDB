She belongs to the Hmong, an ethnic minority in which girls get married at a very young age. This is often preceded by a controversial “bride-napping,” where the girl is abducted by her future husband on New Year’s Eve. Negotiations between the families follow.  This also happened to Di’s sister and their mother, so it doesn’t seem strange that in preparation the women and girls discuss sex and married life without embarrassment. But Di also goes to school, where she learns very different values. And in her own way, even Di’s mother tries to warn her daughter about child marriage.","popularity":0.8,"poster_path":"/w8ykdZGCU59F8zf3IpthCAwK4b1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123568,"logo_path":"/ksokydHO08gNsR8W2Vh3j7i4xse.png","name":"Purin Pictures","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2022-05-07","revenue":67083,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of the Mist","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
