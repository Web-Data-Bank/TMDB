They were often welcomed in by well-to-do families with domestic staff living in sunny villas, and for most of the children this was a holiday in paradise. The contrast with their living conditions at home, and the huge difference between the lives of rich and poor in Portugal in this period, made a deep impression on the young Austrians.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uPxrXeLBbYibJNN99nj1UtGScBo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kintop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey to the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
