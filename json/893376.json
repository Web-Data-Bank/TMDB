She can only communicate by pointing out letters with her eyes on a special keyboard and she needs 24-hour care. It’s a horrific situation that Kathryn puts into words incisively and pragmatically. The only reason she hasn’t asked to be taken off life support yet, she says, is that she isn’t ready to say goodbye to her children. She wants at least to experience her daughter Minou’s wedding day.","popularity":1.293,"poster_path":"/gtTUDnCSYnaSv6y347DvK2YlrtU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186502,"logo_path":"/k1hHXBGIkegY0N6fjXL4TEuBsAK.png","name":"Zela Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eat Your Catfish","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
