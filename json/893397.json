Not only did the series insist on having kids speak to kids about their favorite stories, but Reading Rainbow introduced the world to one of the most adored television hosts of all time in LeVar Burton. Thanks to his direct, non-patronizing and, most importantly, kind delivery, Burton became a conduit to learning for children of every background—an entrancing guide to subjects unknown.","popularity":1.51,"poster_path":"/iMxAM9O3jAycF6a2WpbXPaW1Hey.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128976,"logo_path":"/6ZfJiskmTdzvYs8861ynrFNMSzk.png","name":"XTR","origin_country":"US"},{"id":116538,"logo_path":"/n5d2MXzCcyG0FSbfQClp6fVrDJV.png","name":"Sidestilt Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":23232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Window Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":153886,"logo_path":"/wcOgb8591a6a506L1bUqxEiRv1B.png","name":"Foothill Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of Reading Rainbow","title":"Butterfly in the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
