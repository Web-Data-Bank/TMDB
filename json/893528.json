In fact, Moore’s “wild decorum” is an accurate reflection of her character and values, exalting a gusto (as she said) that gets things done without running roughshod, a propriety that refuses to wink, distort, or disdain. But for all this down-to-earth practicality, her long, artfully poised sentences and strict but arbitrarily syllabic stanza forms also force us to a self-conscious awareness of the language itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vNi9cqisdULH9QntGfdsjDFNJAf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices & Visions: Marianne Moore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
