Figures and objects are isolated, linked together only by their presence on a beach, all exposed to direct or indirect threats. The different jellyfish are as much at threat – washing up dead, stranded in the desolate landscape – as they are a threat – appearing suddenly and making people vanish.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yFnLybM1AjGLSzj6wqrv4t3JtCm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38052,"logo_path":"/8uZNsz3zVarlswxx3CDBtfLPgMT.png","name":"Amber Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jellyfish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
