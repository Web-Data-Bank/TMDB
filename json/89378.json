Every July, crowds line up around the block before each screening; the festival itself lasts approximately 3 weeks. In the Belly of the Beast chronicles the intense struggles that five filmmakers in attendance went through to complete their films. Crew rebellions, corporate embezzlers, and bankrupt studios are just a few of the memories conjured up during candid interviews, while the camera captures the latest challenge: the public acceptance - or rejection - of their films. Included in Dark Sky Films's Manson Family DVD and Blu-ray releases.","popularity":0.734,"poster_path":"/mZVF40uyUxNR1Sdcq0LpZsR9D69.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196432,"logo_path":null,"name":"Videokiller Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":182669,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Film Board of Canada","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Belly of the Beast","video":false,"vote_average":6.25,"vote_count":2}
