Mrs O. thinks her neighbor is a secret agent. Mrs O. has Alzheimer’s, but her pet name for her disease is “Alda.” With great humor, irony, and self-deprecating insight, this defiant and willful woman commentates on her own daily life in Prague. There’s a list on the door of friends and family members she’s allowed to let in even if she doesn’t recognize them. Sometimes she thinks she’s living under Communist rule, and she worries that if she doesn’t hang out a flag on Labor Day she’ll be arrested.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ms2YTBIxYBEbblYgjv5NbPWRnDW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alda","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
