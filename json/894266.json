In this film, Fahdel's camera shows us Iraqis in another light and the hopes and fears of these men and women who escaped the nightmare of a dictatorship only to be mired in chaos. He is better equipped than anyone for this task. He is both an \"outside\" angle of vision and a brotherly view. An Iraqi among Iarqis, he embodies a reference point in the turmoil. His presence and commitment during the past year, his receptivity during those months when everyone was preparing for war explains why his camera is never indiscreet or prying.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lJ3RJHf6QEohc5FqwhmWLUnhrye.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Iraqis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
