Did she get her upturned nose from her father? No one who knows the answer, because 13-year-old Jaël is the child of an anonymous donor. She'll be allowed to make contact with him when she turns 16, but she doesn't want to wait that long—Jaël wants to know right now who her father is. While she’s waiting, she shares with us her fantasy father— imagine John Travolta with a stubbly beard—and she explains why she wants so much to meet him: “The most important thing to me is recognition.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father Wanted: With a Piggy Nose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
