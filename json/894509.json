After a wild college party, both land in bed together, but Shyam restores their honour the next day by proclaiming his love for Sundari and that he is going to marry her. His elder brother (Ashok Kumar), however, forbids him this wedding and forces him to accept an arranged marriage with Nisha (Supriya Pathak) who long before has lost her heart out to Shyam. The latter finally gives in, not knowing that Sundari since that night is in a delicate situation. As Pradeep learns that Sundari is pregnant and in despair about Shyams treason has tried to kill herself, he takes care of her and marries her. Only after Sundari has given birth to a daughter, Pradeep reveals the truth to Shyam.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tIIcOpZw1qM26cS7cMWHTjmDiKs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bekaraar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
