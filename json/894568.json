For hatred and accusations are never greater than longing and love for one another.  You meet the family one autumn evening in the parents' Östermalm apartment. Margareta and Henrik have invited their daughters to dinner, as they do every month. Ann lives with her son in a one bedroom apartment and struggles to make a living. Ewa and her husband live in a villa in Stocksund and must have three cars to be able to work that much.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bH2GvhEAEzUm3IcJ3clUIIYERLd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2009-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Höst och vinter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
