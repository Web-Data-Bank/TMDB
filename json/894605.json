At least from the western anthropocentric perspective, that is, do these things not have any language of course.\r This film is a nonlinear narrative of queer potentialities surrounding ecological intimacies and all that sex could hope to contain within and outside of itself; it is ultimately a story with no end, and if it were to have an ending - for example, the last chapter read or watched or heard - it would end with an ellipsis.\r “Fish Bowl” is my attempt at fusing queer bodies; and all that bodies entail in their interconnectedness with other bodies (including the other that is themselves,) with an empathic kinship with nature. And by nature I do not mean the nature that has been opposed to culture or society or a nature to be tamed, I mean queer nature for nature is inherently queer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5C9uvWe7OSHcHqMHa3eEpgBpXKH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fish Bowl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
