Van risks his life to mount undercover rescues. Maria escaped sexual slavery and now pursues the traffickers who profit from human misery. Three ordinary people with extraordinary stories - all on a mission to end modern-day slavery. Be it the Vietnamese lawyer who rescues women from China's sex trade or the Mexican survivor turned sleuth, these profiles explore the challenges of combating slavery. The pressure is high and the stakes are even higher for those dedicated to tackling the global trade in sex and labour that claims an estimated 25 million victims around the world. These efforts come at a cost - solitude, sorrow and stress - but their lives are seldom showcased. This animation series presents a rare glimpse into the lives of those who dare to take on the traffickers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o3YvhxzO5HBS66DLksUGoXJqitJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thomson Reuters","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taking on the Traffickers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
