We just go on with business as usual. But climate change, just like the loss of biodiversity and the current pandemic, is a consequence of how we treat nature. Corona is a wake-up call that has disrupted all of our lives. All attention goes towards solving the current problem: controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But prevention is better than cure. To do this, we have to look at how infectious diseases emerge and spread. World-renowned artist Steve Cutts created an animated film for the Nicolaas G.
