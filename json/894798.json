Stills punctuate abstract and documentary footage, offering a collage of mediums in the face of the unknowable. \"Sorties\" is a military term-- a mission launched from a defensive position. That's sort of what a walk felt like in March 2020 in NYC. And then of course things changed; cases went up and down, the science evolved, fear waxed and waned. Of course, the pandemic continues; but I had to limit myself in making the film; March 2020-August 2021.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4rYCdS4lfpE2KhTJC1UpmKO36Ou.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorties","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
