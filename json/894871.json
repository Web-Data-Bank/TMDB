But having risked everything to be with her and lost, his hopes of happiness soon turn into a jealous rage.  With equal parts danger and desire, Carmen is an intoxicating cocktail that never fails to excite the senses. French mezzo-soprano Stéphanie d'Oustrac plays the seductive heroine with a rock ‘n’ roll attitude who bears more than a passing resemblance to Amy Winehouse. Spanish director Àlex Ollé’s production is conducted by Kazushi Ono at the New National Theatre Tokyo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gDbAkkw99iTumsGdygg2Cwx6cNP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmen - NNTT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
