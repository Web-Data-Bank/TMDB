With honour at risk, social status bartered and happiness illusive, the Marschallin accepts time cannot be stopped and she must set young love free.  Exquisite music, poignant comedy and fairy tale romance: Der Rosenkavalier has it all. For its Garsington premiere, Bruno Ravella transposes what is perhaps  Richard Strauss’s most famous opera to the glamorous 1950s. Jordan de Souza conducts the excellent Philharmonia Orchestra and a bravura cast. ‘Garsington is back with a show that’s a joy to the ears, and a feast for the eyes.’ Mail on Sunday","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7loQMuHBLr9EXkfzY6CxYylWc2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Rosenkavalier - Garsington","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
