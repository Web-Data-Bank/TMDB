It takes one through the eccentric experience of the country’s diversity- from the strong, frothy chaya and luxurious orthodox leaf tea to the milky-spicy ginger chaha and savoury sheer chai. Through myriad preparation and drinking practices of the camellia sinesis, the Film uncovers the varied identities and paradoxes that sometimes make and sometimes break the idea of India.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":66632,"logo_path":"/alQJKHLQlV3EFkCshP5pyLfI3z0.png","name":"Doordarshan","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary by Shweta Ghosh","title":"Steeped and Stirred","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
