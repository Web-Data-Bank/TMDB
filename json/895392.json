The husband is just as irritated by her nagging since this time it is interfering with him trying to take a shave and brush his teeth. Their argument extends to what belongs to whom and what each person contributes to the household. They end up doing things and making remarks just to irritate the other. Their argument reaches a whole different level when a pretty neighbor gets peripherally involved.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9329,"logo_path":"/aue5pVfj9TcjYEOufkcuCbAL5hE.png","name":"The Vitaphone Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1931-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The constantly bickering couple are at it on a pleasant Sunday at home.","title":"The Naggers' Day of Rest","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
