The melting ice is causing rockfalls, lifts and mountain huts are no longer safe, and age-old climbing routes are becoming impossible. The filmmaker is accompanied by ecologists, an experienced guide and an ultrarunner to identify some of the trends. Whilst climbers are enjoying longer seasons and mountain goats and chamois are able to graze at higher altitudes, the local tourism-based community is wondering how it can adapt to these rapid changes. The remarkable time-lapse images are particularly insightful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dYUl6qM41yjvLJ2zRibfDjHqV3n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falling Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
