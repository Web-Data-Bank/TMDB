Paolo Rolli's libretto is based on the story of Ortensio Mauro's La superbia d'Alessandro. This was the first time the famous singers Faustina Bordoni and Francesca Cuzzoni appeared together in one of Handel's operas. The original cast also included Francesco Bernardi who was known as Senesino.  The story recounts Alexander the Great's journey to India and depicts him less in a heroic vein than as vainglorious as well as indecisive in matters of the heart. The work's charm and lightness of touch make it at times almost a comic work.[3]","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bQ3fvIX7MRe6gJoR9qRy5pcfU1M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parnassus Arts Productions","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the Royal Opera of Versailles, 2013 - Opera in 3 acts by Händel with a libretto by Paolo Rolli","title":"Haendel - Alessandro with Max Emanuel Cencic (Opéra Royal de Versailles)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
