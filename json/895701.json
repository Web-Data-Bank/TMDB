The final moments of the film director's life are acted out by twenty-four men and women of different nationalities, all whom are close to the artist. In a shift of focus who embody him, the video also features biographical interviews with each participant. The question once asked to Pasolini about the social and political role of art is echoed in the stories of the actors, in their most prosaic aspects as in their most decisive questioning. By putting them together, the artist creates a mosaic portrait of a community and the daily struggle to overcome social conditioning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mXBXoRNf7eIZQSD7klx7LJI6ey.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rome, 1er et 2 Novembre 1975","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
