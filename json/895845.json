These ancient trees and their ecosystems have been lost forever. Fairy Creek (Ada'itsx), one of BC's last untouched old growth watersheds, lies on Southern Vancouver Island on the unceded territories of the Pacheedaht, Ditidaht and the Huu-ay-aht Nations. Despite Premier John Horgan's 2020 election promise to protect the remaining 2.7% of old growth forest, logging of Fairy Creek continues unabated. In August 2020, forest and land defenders began setting up blockades to prevent the destruction of this beautiful and fragile ecosystem. One year later, after mass civil action, over 500 arrests and intense public pressure, the conflict continues. This comprehensive and compelling documentary film sheds light on the issues around the logging and blockades, through conversations with Indigenous Elders, politicians, police, lawyers, front line activists, and many others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9S8Ks4ewU3K2BjJrRVHhkIqIlgZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164089,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canada's Social Change-Makers","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fairy Creek: The Last Stand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
