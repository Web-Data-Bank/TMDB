They always get fired from any job they take. Most recently, Kadir and Doyok had been working at a company owned by the father of Lola (Diah Permatasari), but were going to be fired by the new owner, Abud (Fuad Alkhar), who had taken over the company. Kadir-Doyok then asked Lola why her father had sold the company to Abud, and it turns out that Abud had conned her father. Kadir and Doyok then try to expose the fraud. They succeed mostly because they happen to intercept a phone call meant for Abud.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iJOXq85dNTlL9GVGm4myJ2sE2sU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83704,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Parkit Films","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1992-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salah Pencet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
