In the Great Liberation War of 1971, millions of people of Bangladesh migrated from their homeland for liberation, for the first time they were identified as political refugees. After the brutal assassination of the Father of the Nation on 15 August 1975, thousands of freedom fighters and many politically Awami League followers had to accept refugee life again.
