At the early age of 16, she had already been to Argentina to summit Aconcagua (6,961 m). In addition to her expeditions in Patagonia, Alaska, Iran, and the Himalayas, her experience as a mountain guide in her native Swiss Alps also shaped the young alpinist. In this portrait, we follow her there—to the icy heights of Switzerland where Caro North feels most at home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I am North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
