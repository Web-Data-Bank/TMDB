The park, which features giant concrete spheres and pipes, allows the visitor to reconsider the experience of space, earth and sky within an urban context. It also serves as a kind of contemporary Stonehenge: once a year, on August 1 at 9:30 am, the shadows of the objects exactly align with outlines on the ground. Interviews with the artist, the architects, engineers, contractors, and the public, among others, reveal Dark Star Park as both a public sculpture and a functioning park that reclaims a blighted urban environment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fK3KHMc4DbodkvhRb9tGxlt7lOj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art in the Public Eye: The Making of Dark Star Park","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
