He sends Doyok to Yogyakarta to continue his studies while staying at the home of Uncle Simon (Robert Syarief). Doyok talks his friend Kadir into posing as Doyok himself and going with him to Yogyakarta.  Once Kadir is accepted into Simonâ€™s household as Doyok, it becomes very clear that the discipline there is really tough because Simon was formerly a member of the Indonesian Armed Forces. In the meantime, Doyok meets up with Rina (Yayik Artikandi), his girlfriend, who gets him a job as a taxi driver. However, this masquerade is uncovered when Robby shows up in Yogyakarta to check on how his son Doyok is doing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/23auq2lP0TrDOAoR2h5OZ7RYemO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83704,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Parkit Films","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1993-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tahu Beres","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
