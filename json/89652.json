Having exhausted every other avenue, Vanni forms a crack squad of motorcycle-riding, Colt .38-toting elite officers, tasked with meting out justice on the margins of the law. But when the Marsellaise launches a bombing campaign designed to extort a vast ransom from the city's authorities, Vanni finds himself in a race against time to exact his revenge and avert disaster.","popularity":1.85,"poster_path":"/lbWogWBxlyem3O4g0Htjvpq7bNB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83486,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":83303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rewind Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1976-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colt 38 Special Squad","video":false,"vote_average":6.893,"vote_count":14}
