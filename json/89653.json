Sullivan puts together a group of Italian-Americans into disguise as Italian soldiers in order to infiltrate a North African camp held by the Italians. After the soldiers have knifed the Italians in their beds, they find a hooker living at the camp. Sullivan's commandos are to hold this camp and its weaponry until an American battalion arrives, all the while these Italian-Americans pretend to be Italian soldiers, often hosting the enemy. Lt. Valli is a young, \"green,\" by-the-book officer who constantly argues with Sgt. Sullivan, who tells his superior that he has no idea what he is doing. One man on the base, probably a touch from Argento, is an entomologist who is needlessly killed. Things go terribly wrong after that.","popularity":4.594,"poster_path":"/7Clnm9KtNWAQhj4QF6pX3a6Ddf0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28057,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produzione Intercontinentale Cinematografica (PIC)","origin_country":""},{"id":18908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Cinema Company Film (CCC)","origin_country":""},{"id":40023,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.G.I.
