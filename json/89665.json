The hussars, mostly ordinary men, have heard news of the uprising and wish to return to the homeland to defend the newly independent country. The Empire, on the other hand, is firmly resolved that all Hungarian troops in the imperial army should be kept as far away from the trouble spot as possible, knowing that most soldiers would be loyal to Budapest rather than Vienna.","popularity":0.77,"poster_path":"/d4aBr2ygMM4JMCoV9nfh3hhbCF0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hungarofilm","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":55540,"logo_path":null,"name":"Objektív Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1978-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"80 Hussars","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":6}
