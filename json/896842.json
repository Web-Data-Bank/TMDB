On a hike in the sunbathed hills of Berkeley, Chaz talks about the importance of honesty, his dog Michael, and nerding out on skate videos - all of which have influenced his creative manner.  With a focus on the interplay of location and sound, music and visuals, MacRae and Bundick bring the west coast heat to the rest of us.
