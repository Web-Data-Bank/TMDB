In an attempt to awaken both herself and her uninterested boyfriend Petter (26), she goes to a pole dancing class where she meets Rebecka (24) – a girl that is everything Ine isn’t. Through Rebecka, Ine gets a glimpse into a world she has been completely isolated from – a world where people fight for the freedom to be themselves completely unfiltered, and where colors and glitter steps into place for the grey, squared life she has been leading. Ine's fascination with Rebecka grows into something she soon wonders if is infatuation. But is it Rebecka she is infatuated with, or is it her life?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1BH37skwxNBWKaeMou4qfFcjQyP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2021-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
