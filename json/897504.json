Cattle Decapitation's vocalist and art director Travis Ryan had this to say about this first-of-its-kind event: \"When Wes told me he would be down to do a music video for us, my jaw dropped. Having a music video that is completely married to the album artwork and color palette was something I had always wanted to do but never thought it could be a reality. As you can see from our lyrics, there's not a lot of hope floating around hereâ€¦ The scope of the video matches the scope of the album 'Death Atlas', which is meant to be listened to from beginning to the end in its entirety as is the video. Wes Benscoter has proven that he is a master of art, incorporating various mediums into one disastrously beautiful extinction-level art film.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cattle Decapitation Presents: The Unerasable Past- A Short Film By Wes Benscoter","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
