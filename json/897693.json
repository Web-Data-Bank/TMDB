It's the first part of our \"Dostoevsky-L.A\" project, which also will include \"Crime and Punishment, LA\" and \"Idiot, L.A\". The film crosses and re-crosses the thin line that separates tragedy from comedy. It introduces us to the enchanting Linda, whose life is centered around a planned reunion with her former lover Paul. Her plans change in remarkable ways as she encounters an extraordinary cast of characters, including a new lover and a movie producer who is pursued by the Mafia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z6Saf1HxOv2syBIVrxJSR6vpOB8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shades of Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
