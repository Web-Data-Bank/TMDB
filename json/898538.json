In an attempt to understand his parents' radical choices, he dives into the family archive. Extraordinary amateur films and private writings reveal never-ending conflicts and painful memories. Those of a father, a revolutionary commander, who sacrificed everything in the name of political struggle, but who saw his dream of justice vanish. Those of a son, who grew up in the shadow of a charismatic but cumbersome man, unable to accept the needs of a child. Those of a mother. A ghost that has haunted Camilo's dreams since he was five years old. A unique opportunity to give life to an impossible dialogue, long desired but never really happened.","popularity":0.634,"poster_path":"/pNiIF5YAWNsy1ve6rlA4iwMo0Q1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143854,"logo_path":"/lV9inJ52UxHtwMlwm8EEUyfd0nj.png","name":"Inercia Películas","origin_country":"CO"},{"id":113821,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmAffair","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los Zuluagas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
