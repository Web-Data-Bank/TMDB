Emperor Kisra (Kingsley) has a fearsome reputation for being utterly ruthless. But when the Arabian Princess Hind (Hart) refuses to become the emperor’s concubine, the stage is set for an epic confrontation. It is a battle that, by its conclusion, will have changed the region forever and echo throughout history. Escaping with her father, King Numan (Massoud) into the vast and unforgiving desert, Hind is pursued by Kisra’s seasoned mercenary Jalabzeen and his bloodthirsty troops. Hind and her father are forced to entrust their safety to a mysterious bandit (Mackie), whose fighting prowess is second to none. The bandit harbors his own secrets, which will play a large part in deciding the fate of the battle. Hind inspires the fractious tribes to come together for one last stand and unite against an army that outnumbers them and is far better equipped.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145428,"logo_path":"/dgUV94AxFEumfIICKEg5UdCCU3k.png","name":"MBC Studios","origin_country":"AE"},{"id":124233,"logo_path":null,"name":"JB Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":110799,"logo_path":"/eHjtiQJjrGQTooEsBmPSYoUnNB.png","name":"AGC Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":164534,"logo_path":null,"name":"NEOM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","name":"Saudi Arabia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Desert Warrior","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
