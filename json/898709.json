The repertoire materials and landscapes integrate the chorus of testimonies from friends, collaborators, artists, and critics with the same mysterious serenity of the artist's voice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164535,"logo_path":null,"name":"LaGalla23 Productions","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sulle tracce di Maria Lai","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
