One of the artists there, Felix Benavente (Sidney Mason), uses her as model when he paints a portrait of the Madonna for a church. His friend Robert Sinclair (Hugh Thompson) corrupts Mary so that her father (Walter Law) casts her from his home. She goes to live with Sinclair in his mountain lodge, but after the birth of a child, he callously casts her aside. Subsequently, her baby dies and she sinks to the depths of despair.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mJDZaFECgx8f0NcmePVzLGdOXq9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A beautiful model who became a vampire","title":"The Forbidden Path","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
