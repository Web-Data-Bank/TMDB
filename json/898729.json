Although she is on the verge of giving up on her new life in the United States, she is surprised to find that by playing her father's violin that she hadn't had the heart to touch since her journey began, she is able to bring him back to her for one final goodbye. Though the encounter with her father is short-lived, it gives Ailidh the encouragement she needs to continue to follow her dreams of becoming a performer and she is left with a newfound confidence that she will be okay in her new life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fo2IJ2CraKDZMhBUF7GEhsoU8Ju.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Savannah College of Art and Design","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heartstrings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
