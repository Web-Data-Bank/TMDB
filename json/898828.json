From the burning of witches to the femicides of today, through the repression and control of the church and society in our bodies and in our way of existing as women. Through a compilation of films, television programs and manipulated dialogue we see how these stereotypes and violence against women continue to be replicated in real life and today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2PBdk3uZIJGOvm2iJAiL8VQuetW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Madrina","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
