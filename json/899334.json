They're her relationships: four coupled friends from college and her husband, Mark. But somewhere along the way, Mark became distant, which led to Frankie being lonely. . . and ultimately led to Frankie having an affair with her best friend's husband. During a dinner party at her house, the truth is unexpectedly revealed not only for Frankie and Mark, but also for swingers Mandy & Jeff and on-the-rocks Tiffany & Russell.

Or, will the damage be irreparable?","popularity":0.872,"poster_path":"/dsN7LA1RP315Ln8cuJlYOP7JiZo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/pXHXO1qKuQEDv8NDvoNmSaV4gvi.png","name":"Wicked Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Which one is your favorite dish?","title":"Dinner at Frankie's","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
