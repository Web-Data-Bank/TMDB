This illuminating debut by D.C.-based filmmaker Lisa Mao profiles Chinatowns in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Boston and features the voices of residents, community activists, developers, government officials, and others who have a connection to these ubiquitous neighborhoods. Mao skillfully explores the survival of urban ethnic neighborhoods and presents the present-day pressing topic of urban development and gentrification through the eyes of those on the frontlines. Through the voices of those involved, the film brings a 360-view of changing populations and the diverse fabric of people and interests that are in constant flux and negotiation throughout the United States and its history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2bYRMcQbMvc6NYHkVfnz8aN05L3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tale of Three Chinatowns","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
