From the detective's notification to her family to facing the killer in court, we see the pain, anger and heartbreak a family must endure while the nightmare is investigated. The filmmaker is the brother of the late Alice Stevens and, in this tribute, ultimately asks if it's even possible to move forward after such a traumatic event.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/v9GbGaVlLIOLcELAjA0D9c9G1KP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150272,"logo_path":null,"name":"APS Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What is life after murder?","title":"Alice is Still Dead","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
