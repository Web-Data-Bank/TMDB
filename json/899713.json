A \"monkey man\" leads his monkey and the camera through the city streets, where the sound of spinning wheels can be heard coming from the alleyways, and the calls of street vendors and the performance of a voice mimic echo off the walls of old buildings. The film evokes the faint fragrance of Kolkata that lingers in these fragments of memory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronicle of an Amnesiac","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
