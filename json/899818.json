The Luck of the Draw centers around Siouxsie Q's adult radio talk show, in which guests are invited to share their secrets and sexual fantasies. There's a huge variety of scenes, including a lesbian love triangle, a married couple trying to shake things up and a photo shoot that turns X-rated. The film is modern, interesting; even the intro is sleek and edgy. At 1.5 hours there is something for every taste, starring Mickey himself and a large cast of well-known adult performers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bFhkyqyuf1VoJGcSTATUMFRbX3p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1891,"logo_path":"/8wZFrxv9YsWUeqdRa2k33xBABLQ.png","name":"Adam \u0026 Eve","origin_country":"US"},{"id":164744,"logo_path":null,"name":"ModCine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Luck of the Draw","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
