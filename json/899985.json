I read and liked Mr Fukuma's poetry collection, \"Country Life,\" and we began to correspond. Mr. Fukuma has doubts about modern urban life and is searching for a better place to live. I heard that he was interested in tai chi, a traditional Chinese martial art, and had begun to practice it, so I decided to photograph him and his wife as they naturally communicated with each other.
