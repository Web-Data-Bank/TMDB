His dream almost came true - he got a job in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic... as an administrator. Arsen did not have a medical education, but he was good at earning money by passing off Chinese implants for Swiss ones or selling a place in a queue to patients. Everything was seized from him, until the \"fresh tuning\" of the next star of show business exploded right on board the plane! Together with fake implants, Arsen's career was scattered to shreds - he was forced to flee from Moscow to his native Sochi. Where, in what he is sure, his rich experience will allow him to open his own clinic and make this world a better place! Well, or at least more.","popularity":0.724,"poster_path":"/qszScdWQQauo7Z2zmXROJ1SFfXL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124488,"logo_path":"/bmWtInD9QmnjJMR4igtETWOEbU0.png","name":"MEGOGO","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Master for all sizes","title":"Doctor Whistle","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
