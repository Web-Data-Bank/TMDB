Within a few months over 2,000 men and women of Japanese ancestry were arrested, detained and incarcerated in Hawaii and later sent to the Department of Justice and War Relocation Authority camps on the continental U.S. There was no evidence of espionage or sabotage and no charges were ever filed against them.  While the story of mass internment of Japanese Americans in California, Oregon and Washington has been well documented, very little is known about the Hawaii internees and the confinement sites located in Hawaii. This is the first full length documentary to chronicle this untold story in Hawaii's history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Untold Story: Internment of Japanese Americans in Hawaii","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
