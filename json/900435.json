As this story unfolds over our nation’s history, the very same inequalities and biases continue to plague our healthcare system, creating disparities in the quality of care that Black and Brown people are afforded. Interwoven with the testimonies of experts and medical practitioners are the personal stories of patients who have been victimized by healthcare inequities, including the filmmaker’s own experiences as a quadriplegic African American woman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Q5w7WdB3WAQzci2jfPg9iSQt3v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deadliest Disease in America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
