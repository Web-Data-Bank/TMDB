We follow them closely, during their first intimate moments. As their relationship evolves and they are living together, Musa strives to fit within unfamiliar circumstances, while Simos tries to control his possessiveness and enduring fear of losing his lover. Whenever his rationalization proves insufficient as a instrument for handling his crises, Simos opens the door that separates fantasy from reality and channels his fears into his dreams, which sooner or later become haunting nightmares.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hxaj5iCmAsiZXSjsOUCvakvwnNK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Musa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
