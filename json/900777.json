The film explores the ways in which the current rural generation investigates their place in the world, the future that awaits them and how to overcome prejudices to achieve it. As they conquer the world of robotics, with incredible determination and humility, they teach adults what the future is all about, how to achieve it, and why it is worth it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Fe9nD3IhnGqGbpNGr9ZuneFM1r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2021-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The center of the world is everywhere","title":"We Dream of Robots","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
