He's less than impressed by the selection of applicants, that is, until Ally shows up at the door. Ally is stunning, and his friends can't talk Jack into moving her in quick enough… That's when the fun begins…. For everyone but Jack that is. He has a self-imposed 'No Sex With Roommates' policy, but Ally's making it very difficult to sick to. In the end, after she's had sex with half the neighborhood, Jack can't take it any more, and gives in. But by now, the quirky roomies have actually fallen in love with each other... and like any good Hollywood movie… Live Happily Ever Afte…. Oh, and have great sex!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/syvakr0bIyI8OkKIdjs6SHWQwlm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/pXHXO1qKuQEDv8NDvoNmSaV4gvi.png","name":"Wicked Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roommates","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
