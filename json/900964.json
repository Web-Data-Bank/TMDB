She frequently dreams of the feminine spirit of the garden, named Nunkui like her. The girl does not know this spirit, she does not understand her dreams and is afraid; she fears that it is a dangerous spirit, an Iwianch. Curiosity, anguish and food shortages lead Nunkui to discover the knowledge of Rosa, her great-aunt, who still cultivates a traditional garden (aja shuar). Little by little, the garden and the sacred songs (anents) become a refuge for the young woman.","popularity":0.722,"poster_path":"/8kMp77H35lpUPuw4X5fuUDrACRO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180673,"logo_path":null,"name":"NÃºa Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2022-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nunkui","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
