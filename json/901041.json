She thought her best friend Abbey would always be there for her, understanding and accepting and laughing to the end. She thought Abbey was the only one who knew about her husband, the violence, her plan to escape. Joely thought she could get away. She thought her lover Wes would save her from the perfect-looking marriage, with his solid arms and sure gaze. She barely blinked when he showed her his bachelor suite - built secretly into a concrete storage unit -- she didn't care. She thought it didn't matter. She thought they were in love.  And an hour outside the city, a dark figure stalks the storage unit hallways and metal boxes, luring victims to a silent, bloody end. Joely thought her connection to this killer would stay a secret forever. Joely was wrong.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knife to a Gunfight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
