But is that true? This important presentation looks at biased objections that have been voiced against the young-earth view.  These objections include:  Genesis 1 is not a historical narrative to be taken literally  Too much happened on day 6 for it to be 24 hours  Genesis 1 and 2 are contradictory creation accounts  The Bible is not a science textbook  Genesis 1 was written as a polemic against pagan ancient Near-Eastern creation myths  You will see that, under careful scrutiny with an open Bible, these objections crumble.
