Fraser and the Lisu People","overview":"In 1908 a young English college graduate gave up a potential career and fame to serve as a missionary in the remote regions of China. But after six years, there was little response and the mission needed him elsewhere. What would James O. Fraser do? Breakthrough is a deeply inspiring half-hour docudrama which tells the story of how thousands of Lisu people came to faith in Christ. Breakthrough inspires many people -- whether viewed at home, with a college group, small group or church class, during a missions course or any prayer gathering.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AnH6OMv14G4do3iSLVeRd7NOuji.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164980,"logo_path":null,"name":"OMF International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breakthrough: The Story of James O.
