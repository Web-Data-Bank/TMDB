Unaware of her son’s death, Kamal Matmati’s mother would still go above and beyond for years, trying to reach him with letters and clean clothes. Thirty years later, a trial is held addressing Matmati’s death at the hands of the Ben Ali regime. The mother is asking for her son’s corpse so they can give him a proper burial. Matmati’s voice, who speaks to us posthumously, raises a discussion about the manipulated collective history that serves only the oppressors’ agenda.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6m0Ya4thDS5s3q7MqjYFSgGjRyJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79189,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Luna Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":81263,"logo_path":null,"name":"APA : Artistes Producteurs Associés","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Spot","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
