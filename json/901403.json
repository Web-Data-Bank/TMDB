Yet, there is a lot to see and hear: the rain in Oakland, the grandmother’s home in Baghdad, the aunts’ voices in Whatsapp, a little girl learning to count to 10. The story is told through scattered photographs, as well as random voice notes. The film redefines the notion of “home” and expands the meaning beyond a physical structure by accessing it through the words that, aided by the abstract collages, paint an image of a territory that can be dubbed as homeland, even after the visual recollection is lost. A heart-aching testimony on diaspora and homesickness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uluKdNQb4usM7LY5Da7eVMLyRVU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echolocation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
