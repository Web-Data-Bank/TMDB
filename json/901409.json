But rather than seeking to define socialism, director Marc Karlin instead created a series of portraits of people whose lives had intersected with the concept in practical (rather than abstract) terms - it is part of how they define themselves - and asked what 'socialism' meant to them and whether they believed it to be on its way out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jBuVsvYLdI0qZB7g9RW2B9cXuia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Utopias","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
