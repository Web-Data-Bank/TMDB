Ellie Kendrick, a truly youthful Juliet, and Adetomiwa Edun, a boyish Romeo, head an excellent cast whose period costumes point to the timelessness of parental disapproval, adolescent temperament, rivalry and violence. Filmed before a live audience at Shakespeare’s Globe in the heart of London, its intimate and atmospheric setting adds immediacy and vitality to the humour and passion of Shakespeare’s verse. Filmed in High Definition and true surround sound.","popularity":1.159,"poster_path":"/v57npARzsW0TNvlM28iL6YNkZZg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":171,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romeo and Juliet - Live at Shakespeare's Globe","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
