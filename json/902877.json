To begin our tale, a seductive and sexy magician, Alyssa Reece, introduces herself to Lutro, a man sitting by himself at the pub. The witchy wonder makes the rest of the patrons disappear before enjoying Lutro's long wand. Leanne Lace is lost in a mighty forest when she happens upon drifter Adam Essex. He invites her into his tent, but it's Adam who'll do most of the entering. After receiving a kiss, a man morphs into a younger version of himself and gives Stacy Bloom steamy sex to remember inside a mysterious antique shop. Thanks to Teresa's (Cherry Kiss) magical powers, what begins as a boring blind date turns into a night of passion after she morphs into a gorgeous sex bomb. Magic abounds!","popularity":0.971,"poster_path":"/iDtI4EF7oNNvmS9cp4BXICOAxia.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/pXHXO1qKuQEDv8NDvoNmSaV4gvi.png","name":"Wicked Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales from Cockwarts","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":3}
