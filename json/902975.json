A world far away from city noise and so called  “modern culture”. A world that was created by God, not by human beings. Jonas, called by the villagers the “Bull”, because of his unbelievable strength, lives in such a world. He walks through his life unrushed and certain, reminding a today‘s man of his fragility. He reveals a world where life and death, joy and sadness, power and weakness coexist together inseparably, a world which fills up with apocalyptic visions and the “end of the world” feeling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ypJYH1wkgOd8Tr7yjK6bxUe25PF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monoklis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dzukija’s Bull","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
