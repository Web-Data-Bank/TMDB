The goal - cycle 800 km over sandy and brushes filled trail, cross rivers and streams taking no more than 5 days. For some - it was a race, for others an opportunity to experience Lithuania's natural beauty and a good way to test themselves. There was no monetary or any other price waiting for the finishers except for a t-shirt and self-satisfaction.  The film \"Challenge Yourself - Epic Hydra\" follows a 62 year old Vitalijus, who despite his age, was determined to test himself and as he said himself: \"see how old I've gotten\". The only fear he had was the fear of not making it to finish.  The 38 minutes of the film have the sun, the rain, the tough and not so much bits, but the the thing that it has a lot of - the will to challenge oneself!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ogulpdlTjMTTJgL6JYt7Gh4OXN6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Epic Hydra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
