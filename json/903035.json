Mistaken for a key-note speaker he makes the snap decision to present the final lecture of the day. Not knowing what will come next on each presentation slide he improvises, throwing the notes out and speaking from the heart. Slowly the room begins to warm to his eccentric and unconventional style as he lays himself bare, self-imploding in front of a room full of strangers. It becomes obvious that he is not the lecturer and everyoneâ€™s world is thrown off course.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iqdoy4I9hynINebjLKGysGWjgAu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165121,"logo_path":null,"name":"RWS Films","origin_country":""},{"id":165122,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silent Temple Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Steps to Success","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
