To illustrate this basic truth, thirty-three animators each introduce a character who eats the one previously introduced and is eaten by the next animator's creation. It happens on land and at sea, with humans, animals real and imaginary, aliens, a few plants, and a robot. They are chomped whole, sliced, smashed, flattened, inhaled through straws, eaten from the inside out and the backside forward. Sometimes the little guy wins; nothing and no one is invincible. By the end, we've come full circle.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-12","revenue":9692,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film by Mo Willems","title":"Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
