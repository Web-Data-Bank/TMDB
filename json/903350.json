Starting from facts and a little dull talks with historians, the search of information (knowledge) takes them to Paris where they discover even more philosophical questions related not only to the independence, but as well to the concept of freedom in general.  “We have started making a movie about the freedom conference of 1919 and the role of Lithuanians in it. But making this movie we have stumbled upon lots of ideas. We have started asking ourselves, what is freedom, and what is the difference between the territorial and personal, or self-freedom?”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lituanie, my Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
