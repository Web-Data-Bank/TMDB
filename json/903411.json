It examines cultural production, public space and the collective imaginary through the prism of the ghost, understood as an echo of silenced voices and historical facts. Developed with Moroccan and Spanish cultural agents, the project explores narrative strategies to resignify places such as the Plaça Tetuan in Barcelona, the neighborhood of Tetuán de las Victorias in Madrid or the cinema “Español” in the proper city of Tetwan, Morroco.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8IAIf6AedRL0P9ibPxE8pZvKaQZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157920,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lejos Lejos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tetuan, Tetuán, Tetwan (Primera parte)","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
