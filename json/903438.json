Initially began as a simple action to replace the practice of writing a diary (which he found difficult to continue), Imai has been able to continue this daily action to this day and plans to continue it until the end of his life. In this work, Imai’s daily photographs that he had taken from 1979 to 2004 are sped up to appear like a moving image, akin to an animation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1979-2004","title":"ときの重奏:デイリーポートレイト","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
