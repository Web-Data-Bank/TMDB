In a packed auditorium at the University of Central Oklahoma, AiG founder Ken Ham showed that cultural issues like abortion and gay \"marriage\" are viewed differently because people start with different foundations. Dr. Georgia Purdom (PhD in molecular genetics) then did the same for scientific issues like mutation and natural selection and showed that science supports a biblical, not an evolutionary, worldview.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qhdU9ptOJ2BBswRUdvYlZUp370R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Battle of Foundations","title":"Genesis, Science, and the Culture War","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
