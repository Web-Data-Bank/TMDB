Brutus notices him and puts growth pills on a hamburger. Wimpy then eats it, and it causes him to grow very big. Brutus takes the towering moocher to the circus, but they refuse to hire him. Wimpy seeks help from the Sea Hag, who puts him in a baby carriage. Popeye sees his friend's large size and tries to shrink him down by feeding him spinach, but it only makes him grow bigger. He gives Wimpy a hamburger, which turns him back to normal. Wimpy thanks Popeye and promises to pay him Tuesday for today's hamburger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1488,"logo_path":"/ds4vzeoDAcUk2izdf0pIkR19pbW.png","name":"King Features Syndicate","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Brutus uses garden growth pills to turn Wimpy into a giant.","title":"Popeye and the Giant","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
