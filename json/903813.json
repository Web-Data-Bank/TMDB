They touch, hold, pick, and create, they bring things into existence. This film explores the relationship between art and labor in the most tactile of enterprises. Matter is present both in front of and inside the camera. In front we have ceramics, collectively mixed, molded, and shaped. Inside we have film (celluloid) collecting the light that comes from the world around ARROJALATIERRA. A film about making things that leave a trace in space and time.
