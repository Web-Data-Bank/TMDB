Christiana Perschon continues her creative documentation of female artists (as in SHE IS THE OTHER GAZE, 2018), with a sensitivity to gesture, texture, rhythm, materials. “The line unfolds into something particular,” remarks Beschorner, and the same applies to the film’s capturing and assembling of light, movement, and sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2hk7uyzmdQ3Ojqp4VeMJJdwWhGH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sekundenarbeiten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
