SOCIAL SKILLS provides Hills with the perfect subject: discontinuous fragments from a 60-day class in liberated body movement led by David Zambrano in Belgium. The soundtrack does the splits between disco funk and cartoon noise effects. Is it dance, childlike play, or the Utopian vision of a community of negotiated differences? It is all of these things at once.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uipWNd6ntNjNtgc3HOiv5Gc1rXY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2021-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Social Skills","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
