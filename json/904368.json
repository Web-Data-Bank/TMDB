It journeys through a sleepless night, conquering the semi-conscious moonlit world and the retrospective nature of the night.  The personal stories of twenty experts and enthusiasts in astronomical fields construct the narrative and its landscapes — coffee tables, paper planes, corridors, among other things. This anecdotal format seeks to present science through the eyes of humanity, prompting the audience to experience scientific information through the familiar mundanity of life.   The humanistic vision of science acts as a launchpad for curiosity and allows the audience to access science through their own experiential libraries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mdG9vc7mkxA61kQEVBAOEPQ8sIr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
