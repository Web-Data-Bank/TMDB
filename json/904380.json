There's Kitty Larue, the stripper with an identity problem. There's the horny bible thumping senator who wants to pray with Divine but really wants something less spiritual. Finally, Divine's young virgin daughter returns from boarding school and within minutes is turned into an alcoholic, heroin addicted stripper who has been betrothed to the black janitor. There's more but as the cliché goes, it has to be seen to be believed!  By the time of it's VHS release, the 12 year old live footage was already a bit raw and gritty, but still gives more than a fair idea as to why Divine was so loved as a performer. The production ran for eighty-four performances at the Hurrah Discotheque, New York.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8jeaQY7lWQgYeDNgmzS8a34Wq5S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Neon Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
