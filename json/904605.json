The film is constructed as such to illustrate the cyclic theory of life, death, and rebirth, as the woman's soul travels deep into her residual memories of an ancient and foreign land, with which she shares a mysterious familiarity like a past life. She witnesses its destruction, before seeing its resurrection unfold in the present. Through her exploration, she finds almost mirrored images in her own present life in the West. In her newfound perspective, life and death achieve an equilibrium that transcends the flow of time. At the end of the film, she comes face to face with peace when she meets her inner child, alive before her own eyes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mVvKrKHmRrBjQCpbzOMLMHewNj5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165312,"logo_path":"/nH33SHm4Hqc7p61NlRm7YBuVJ9a.png","name":"Parafauna","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A woman's soul traverses the sea of time.","title":"Dream of Water and Song","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
