Freya thrives in ‘No-man’s land’ – so named for good reason; it’s a remote and remorseless habitat; no man could survive here","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolverine: One Tough Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
