By transforming itself into a not-for-profit organization and building a solid connection with its community, the Revue Cinema provides an excellent example of how indie cinemas seek to provide much more than mere entertainment: they enrich the community and anchor its history.  During the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, Roy Zheng—documentary filmmaker and culture researcher—dove into Revue Cinema’s massive archive and virtually interviewed 34 observers of its ongoing legacy.  This research culminated into a 50-minute linear documentary that explores Revue’s past, present and foreseeable future.  Revue Cinema: Reel Communities will guide you into this 108-year journey. - ROY ZHENG","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oX9sTVZqudaJEq8FMMfzljJk5eH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165391,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roy Zheng Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revue Cinema: Reel Communities","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
