This was also the season when the pathetic Lola team tried to enter Formula One. the drivers being Italian Vincenso Sospiri and Brazillian Ricardo Rosset. But the team didn't enter F1 at all and the new Stewart team was the last team. But forget that. let's move onto the exciting battle between Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve. This will bring back memories of the fierce battles between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, like the Hill v Schumacher battle in 1994 brought some memories. The season started with a bang when McLaren's David Coulthard won an Australian thriller. Then Villeneuve won but Schumacher started to fight back with a win in torrential rain. But then disaster struck. Gianni Morbidelli. replacing his dropped countryman Nicola Larini at the Sauber team, broke an arm in a testing accident and Olivier Panis broke both of his legs in a massive accident at the Canadian GP that stopped the race.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/osr8BmJJYUiWJkTQkxDm40ILmj8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Down to the last 30 minutes","title":"1997 FIA Formula One World Championship Season Review","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
