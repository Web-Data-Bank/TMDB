Eric Lomax and Nagase Takashi met again on the bridge in a meeting that would profoundly change their lives. After this experience, Lomax wrote his famous autobiography \"The Railwail Man\", which was adapted to the cinema in 2013 with the same title. The documentary reveals exclusively what really happened when they both agreed to meet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5FaTdeqcrfAtkjGanEpABhvcHTL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enemy, My Friend?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
