With no pride-modesty the starets recounts the epic of his life in Christ during communism. He was not scared nor silenced, he did not budge nor flee, he did not yield to temptation, to revenge, or to hatred. A genuine hard-working proletarian, with muscles and character of iron, he rose up to his full stature against the System and defeated it in single combat. In the hard years of atheistic persecution, when many priests renounced their faith and abandoned their ministry, the uneducated labourer from the obscure village decided to fill the void, and to become a priest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u2AUsqYKjRWDkKIt4VKosNRnsMT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
