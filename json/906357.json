Beginning with stark footage from the Kwang-ju people's massive uprising and brutal suppression in 1980, through a recent strike of militant office workers, protests by farmers against the import of U.S. dairy products, and a showdown at the border of the two separated Koreas, these tapes seethe with ardent rage and moral intensity. As the struggles have escalated the use of video as a weapon, a record and a defense has grown to be an integral part of the Minjoong Movement, the people's movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Korea: Until Daybreak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
