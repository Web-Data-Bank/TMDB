Whichever is the case, neither friends nor foes are able to resist the powerful draw of Eisenstein's work. He was a person of complexity who was understood in very different ways, as a generous cosmopolitan and a stingy hermit, a cynic and yet a highly sensitive, vulnerable being. The film deals with a number of phases in Eisenstein's life, and tries to get away from the orthodox image of him by using new material to shed a different light on his biography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mAKFIsyMMJ9p4QfluGCvgYdjdjR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2571,"logo_path":null,"name":"SelbstFilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1998-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Different Faces of Sergei Eisenstein","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
