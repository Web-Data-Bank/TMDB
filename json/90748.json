The United Nations estimates as many as 200 million girls are missing in the world today because of this so-called “gendercide”.  The film tells the stories of abandoned and trafficked girls, of women who suffer extreme dowry-related violence, of brave mothers fighting to save their daughters’ lives, and of other mothers who would kill for a son. Global experts and grassroots activists put the stories in context and advocate different paths towards change, while collectively lamenting the lack of any truly effective action against this injustice.","popularity":1.024,"poster_path":"/x4rbN8H9VJwtABIgK25X399tLHO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The three deadliest words in the world","title":"It’s a Girl!","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":6}
