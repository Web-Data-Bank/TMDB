The little monkey didn't take it seriously, saying that it was the most capable because it could climb trees. The little deer and the little monkey couldn't stop arguing, and asked the magpie to comment, but the magpie scratched his head and gave it to Uncle Xiong. Uncle Xiong said that the game will tell the difference, so the little deer and the little monkey competed to pick peaches on the other side of the river.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9leoJXMn4Rmk2E2bfbqBP4MglrO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6223,"logo_path":"/lOxuAoSiKVeePamkUq5VCyUFiPw.png","name":"Shanghai Animation Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who is the Most Capable One","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
