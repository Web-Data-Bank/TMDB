The sisters are less than thrilled by the idea of spending time together: Vicky loves Christmas, whereas Kristina no longer enjoys the holiday without their mom. With strong convincing from Aunt Debbie, the sisters reluctantly accept her gift. Once they arrive at the resort, Kristina and Vicky run into Reginé (Kyana Teresa), a famous singer and one-time best friend who left them behind when fame came calling.","popularity":0.959,"poster_path":"/dR3w7Y7iDnBOYn9smaupakER9Ae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6679,"logo_path":"/doO7VwcEUnidNW0iUJkIF2oZ8Yq.png","name":"MarVista Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sisterly Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
