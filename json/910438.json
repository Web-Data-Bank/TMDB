Debtors have come to collect old drug debts and Jarna is given 24 hours to pay up, setting off a frantic, amphetamine fueled battle against time. Manic speed, fear of killers on his tail, paranoia and self-loathing over old wrongs eventually lead to a traffic accident. Jarna can no longer escape, his pace slows and he is on the verge of giving up. The moment has come when a near-lifetime of running must come to an end.","popularity":1.233,"poster_path":"/c6LRt4RexqFON7RJVO0f45iopaz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6339,"logo_path":"/ufP8NkiJ9ScGLIKz7J25xKtmVvX.png","name":"Solar Films","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Man Who Loved Speed","title":"On Thin Ice","video":false,"vote_average":5.333,"vote_count":6}
