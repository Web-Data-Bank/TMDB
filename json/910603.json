Some experience maternal burn-out, this physical and mental exhaustion which makes them wonder whether they are actually \"good mothers\". Some feel depressed and others admit that they no longer have time for themselves, that they only think about their children, and sometimes they even hate them. In this documentary, mothers talk about the hell they have experienced and their debilitation in order to help others learn to recognize the signs of this exhaustion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sU0quE5to24zs46hDLQn3RTA5FG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mothers on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
