This provocative and amusing documentary explores the battles being waged in courts, classrooms, museums, film studios, and the Internet over control of our cultural commons. Based on McLeod's award-winning book of the same title, Freedom of Expression charts the many successful attempts to push back this assault by overzealous copyright holders. Freedom of Expression is an essential tool for educators, activists, filmmakers, students, artists, librarians, and more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ceoZoHPwFO6iuzou8b6E9rVYenm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Education Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom of Expression: Resistance & Repression in the Age of Intellectual Property","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
