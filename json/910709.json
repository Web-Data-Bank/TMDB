The feud between the Vasa and Mamia families – historically documented – is causing bloodshed in the region. Bastiano Tansu, a deaf-mute since birth, is one of its protagonists. Mistreated and marginalized since his childhood, after his brother Michele was murdered he joined forces with one of the two leaders of the factions, Pietro Vasa, and put at his service his fury and his amazing aim, becoming a highly feared assassin. The State and the Church try to stem the wave of terror and only after more than 70 deaths, the peace of Aggius arrives. At first, Bastiano finds peace in his love for a pastor's daughter, but in a violent and superstitious world that already labeled him the devil's son when he was just a boy, someone like him cannot be found innocent. Thus, he chooses to confront his own destiny.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/viMzLlu4UeKI8GS7c7UNLpNV6D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2441,"logo_path":"/7Vutdea75apwXkRyfQ4Ne6j0KcN.png","name":"Fandango","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":130081,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sardegna Film Commission Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Sardinian","iso_639_1":"sc","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mute Man of Sardinia","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
