While the owner attempts to mesmerize and seduce the would-be rescuer, a meek student (Clifton Guterman) wanders into the house and becomes a tragic pawn in the psychological game of cat-and-mouse that is rapidly unfolding.","popularity":2.349,"poster_path":"/5L7aGDMLdUS8w9P2LKeGmcqL8ke.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Death","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
