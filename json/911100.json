In this DVD, Ken Ham challenges Christians to hold a high view of Scripture—all of Scripture. He examines Genesis 1:2–5 and other Bible passages to gain a firm grasp on the Bible’s authority and authenticity. The undermining of God’s Word will have lasting effects on future generations; we must repent of our desire to gain the praise of man rather than the “well done” of a holy God.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/emAlLyEpyvjpDMOOXIUVZdJ8t9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stop Trusting Man's Word","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
