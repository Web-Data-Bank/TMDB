Trying her best to be happy about Aaron's recent engagement, Bridget thumbs through his wedding binder, full of inspirational photos and sketches. In the very back, she finds something that Aaron hadn't meant to leave there. On a piece of small, folded piece of paper are all of the friends' names: ranked. Shocked by her placement, Bridget forces Aaron to pull the car over, the rest of the group now turning against him, and each other. The sun starts to set as this six-sided, roadside episode devolves into a mess of accusations and confessions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fcByXw06xYctOdd92TnxtzBaj0n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Definitive Ranking of My Closest Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
