An obsessive, hedonist, visionary, networker and self-promoter, an eternal doubter and admonisher, a lover and seeker, in short: a modern man who was far ahead of his time. In a sensitive blend of fiction and documentary, the film Dürer tells of the life of the eccentric artist and of the stories behind his famous works.","popularity":0.722,"poster_path":"/ZmUXjRByJPsZxoC7wqSI8wbKV3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158256,"logo_path":"/8Vz3cro3iuutl7q5Q6tYOiRAOtO.png","name":"B14 Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":165756,"logo_path":"/kZBJ7fEFnItyDo2TaAIWyDlnovs.png","name":"Gretchenfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dürer","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
