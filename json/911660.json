The director shows him several scripts, but they do not suit; so the director is compelled to call the scenario writer to have a play written in an hour. The director summons his company and reads the play to them; then tells them to make up, while he gives his plots to the stage manager. Being weary, he falls asleep in a chair in the center of the stage and dreams the following: A young girl, employed in an office, falls in love with the head clerk. The boss is a black mustached villain, who is also in love with the girl.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lubin Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dream of a Moving Picture Director","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
