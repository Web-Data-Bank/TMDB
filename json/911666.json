He conceives the idea of playing the game on his little sister, Henrietta. He writes a note reading, \"I have your children. Put four thousand dollars under the stone on front porch and I will bring them back. They are now hanging by the hair. Blue Beard.\" He then tells Henrietta to look the other way, and he takes her dolls out of the doll buggy and hides them in the garden. Then he places the note in the rural delivery mailbox at the front gate. A little later a young fellow brings an auto up to the gate and the children plead for a ride. After a little hesitancy he consents and the children are carried away to the park. Mrs. Mills misses the children and finds the note in the mail box. She takes the matter seriously, and gathering a lot of neighbors and a policeman, gives chase to the auto.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lubin Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Pretending","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
