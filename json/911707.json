As a perfect complement he also had a literary diary. Both form a unique testimonial chronicle: how to read the script and see what was filmed. This documentary deals with that lesser-known area of Díaz's work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4LBenusqqmVW3Jw3P6yj1vq8VXR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cordón Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2021-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Filmador","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
