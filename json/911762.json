Geological and political memory, without centre and without end, which returns in the family films assembled here following a logic of displacements, dispersions, discordances between sound and image. The screen is divided in two, as in the old stereoscopic devices, but the images do not overlap to create a single vision. Instead, they meet in the distance that separates them, as do the people portrayed on them: a group of women in an occupied factory, a woman in an elegant dress looking at herself in a mirror, a baby kicking, little girls posing for their first communion. The rhythm is the discontinuous one of a memory that brings reality and imagination together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/inCTJfugDYBTaPRGmb33tBDX3SV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parallax Dash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
