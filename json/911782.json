The ballet master presides behind her work desk to the creation of steps by different dancers, as varied a mix as the African, Latin American, Fado and jazz music to which they swirl, representing the spirit of that world event. Not by chance, the camera shows prominently a photo-book on the gypsies close to Pina's ashtray. The ballet's premiere was in Germany, and the documentary's premiere was at the EXPO 98 in Lisbon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lissabon Wuppertal Lisboa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
