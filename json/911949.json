The wallpaper torments him, a malevolent wind deters him from eating, and thorned vines erupt in his bedroom. A sudden cataclysm throws him into a craggy wonderland where he wanders into deep forests and through his inner inferno in a quest to mend his damaged spirit. Thematically, this film is concerned with the amorphous fears, covert brutality, yearnings, and magical thinking of childhood, the resiliency of the human spirit, and the meaning of home.  Lush visual images depict the emotional complexities of childhood - the combination of helplessness and invincibility, sweetness and brutality, and the edge where lines between the real and the imaginary are blurred.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9GjuyWv2jmUIrwVxBeYWXToJG6R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flooded Playground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
