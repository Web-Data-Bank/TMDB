Sweetness and love reverse the succession of events, postponing the obvious consequences of the pathology that holds Antonio prisoner, and creating an unexpected life, told by the subjective eyes of a little puppet of Pinocchio, Antonioâ€™s faithful friend since childhood. That is how a tale of Pinocchio develops, but backwards: a child who turns into a puppet as the disease progresses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wRxdncgD6NSaqBAZhDfe9yHIltq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antonio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
