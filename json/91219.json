She escapes the attack and is rescued by Claudio, a photographer who takes her under his wing. Claudio is obsessed by war images that tell of death, devastation and pain. While working with a supermodel, Daniela, it appears that their relationship is bordering sado-masochistic. Things slowly build, with a fair dose of nudity and perversion. Observing all this as best she can Silvia begins to fall in love with Claudio, however she struggles to discern between reality and her traumatic past, especially while Daniela, who is locked in a room, regresses to an almost bestial dimension.","popularity":2.433,"poster_path":"/prBe8f2VFR3QdtMQ7Vq46BVPPY9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anna Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1978-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Movie","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":9}
