Here a group of rapists are required to confront their victims face-to-face. The film concentrates on the bitter verbal sparring session between assaulter Richard (Graham Bechel) and assaultee Rebecca (Dianne Weist). Director Donald Wrye co-wrote the screenplay for Face of Rage with Hal Sitowicz, drawing much of the dialogue from real-life transcripts. The film was first aired as an \"ABC Theatre\" presentation on March 20, 1983, preceded with an all too appropriate \"parental guidance\" proviso.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12077,"logo_path":"/s6p5INYKlo6gD6RFXlm9ACA2VVj.png","name":"Viacom Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":176162,"logo_path":"/9MV8uhnIimEwcu9gDyjeOOnfzVz.png","name":"American Broadcasting Company (ABC)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Face of Rage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
