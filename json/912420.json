While he himself is not interested in profit, he is surrounded by shameless industrialists who steal and exploit his inventions. Adored and ultimately mistreated by his fellow man, the philanthropic genius will only find solace in the company of birds.  Inspired by the life story of engineer Nikola Tesla as fictionalised by novelist Jean Echenoz, the third opera by composer Philippe Hersant lights up Opéra Comique. Conducting the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France and the Chœur Aedès, Ariane Matiakh draws out the poetry from this scientific adventure alongside director Clément Hervieu-Léger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/18nNMgjJhW2kklc3biTEcdsgRSl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Éclairs - Hersant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
