The film opens in the Barbican’s famous concert hall and slowly descends into the bowels of the Chamberlin, Powell and Bon designed complex. The almost hour-long remix by Four Tet provides a seamless soundtrack covering the grounds of cyclical minimalism, hypergrunge and passages of pure silence.  Silence is employed during this piece.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nO0PjauXuod1uz9vtB6tzHhCKEf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sticky Drama (Four Tet Extended Version)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
