Tracked down by the thief of a convenience store whose mischief she witnessed, she finds refuge in an unhealthy affair with an ex-lover, leaving behind her son and her partner at the same time. But wherever she goes, she is haunted by the memory of her little sister who died in horrific circumstances... Gnawed by guilt, Penelope sinks into postpartum psychosis. Little by little, we no longer fear for Penelope, but for Penelope and what she is becoming: a threat to her child.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7824,"logo_path":"/cZKQQwETnhQQhWRe69CDRceOnAE.png","name":"1976 Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Oublier Charlotte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
