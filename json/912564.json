The Berliner Philharmoniker and chief conductor Kirill Petrenko said goodbye to the year with a slightly different Viennese dance music. Incidental music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold enriches a Shakespeare comedy with Viennese flair, Richard Strauss celebrates coffee house culture in his ballet whipped cream, while Maurice Ravel delivers an ecstatic, explosive version of the Viennese waltz with La Valse. Another highlight is Max Bruch's First Violin Concerto with Janine Jansen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Al0ZnmpaPLxJ4U9IrCyRjy8BdMq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berliner Philharmoniker 2021/22: Silvesterkonzert mit Kirill Petrenko und Janine Jansen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
