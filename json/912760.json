With his own voice, Marshawi narrates his memories of the city, bringing to life the waves on Jaffa’s shore, the sounds of its streets, and the sweetness of its inhabitants and its spirit. Recovery is a splendid cinematic experience that attempts to cloud the border between time and space as Marshawi takes us on a tour of magnificent photos from 1930 to 1948, allowing his nostalgia to breathe a new life into the static bodies portrayed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/skqDNcCQrREvWCRHbD2sLz8Av5M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recovery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
