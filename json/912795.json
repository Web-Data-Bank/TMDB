I have interpreted the story and it’s queer undertones by casting Dorian as a young woman discovered by a fashion photographer, then catapulted into the world of empty celebrity. She falls under the tutelage of a famous drag queen and becomes a nightclub luminary, constantly followed by the paparazzi. These media images become the infamous portrait, grotesquely mutating as she grows more beautiful and famous, culminating in her own narcissistic destruction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorian, a cinematic perfume","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
