Zeros in on four California women who get to know one another while traveling to and from Sturgis, S.D., for the world’s largest biker gathering, an annual event since 1938. The rally is a heady brew of races, partying and exhibitionism under the Great Plains sun. The central quartet have come to Sturgis not merely to revel but to work: Among them are two journalists (Cris Sommer-Simmons, cofounder-founder of Harley Women magazine; and Jamic Elvidge, who specializes in test-riding bikes), a singer-songwriter (Gevin Fax) and a photographer (Gail DcMarco).  Combines footage of the women’s trip and post-travel interviews.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24824,"logo_path":"/l9qV55gF4sVK6ZMitwH9csTSOgH.png","name":"Original Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":25928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Turner Original Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":2646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deep River Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biker Women","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
