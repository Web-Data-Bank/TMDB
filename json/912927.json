Святого Миколая","overview":"One week before St. Nicholas Day, St. Nicholas writes an application for sick leave. All gifts for polite children are ready, except for one: a 9-year-old girl Yustia did not write him a letter with her wishes. The same is due to his hospitalization and the fact that no child can be left without a gift, St. Nicholas assigns his responsibilities to the girl's father. The girl's father is a musician and composer who, after the death of his wife (the girl's mother), no longer plays music, but tries to make a career as a presenter, forgetting about his child's dreams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lVwzo4CM5oRZ1LxnfD8AJK5dnjP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165966,"logo_path":"/oZE1gDEVlrAkcW0Hs1KC09YFDIX.png","name":"WOW Studio","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acting Saint Nicholas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
