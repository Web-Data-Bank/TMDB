He also returned there as a teenager-an orphanage worker. And the guy would have had a typical fate for an orphanage: \"He stole, drank, went to prison...\" if he hadn't started building a temple in the Gene colony. And a miracle happened: a guy with no secondary education built a huge temple according to all the canons of ancient Russian architecture! Since then, Hieromonk Gerontius has built two wooden monasteries of rare beauty and several amazing wooden temples. And most importantly, he brought dozens of ex-cons to God. The author of the film tries to answer the question \"how is this possible?\", revealing the character of the hero.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lERsxmYOG78658h86I7KhLnW7gG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Edge of the Earth, or Lived 12 Robbers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
