The fate of the Ainu people is difficult: according to historical documents, the Ainu were the most numerous ethnic group in the Far East. But at the end of the XIX and the beginning of the XX century, some of the Ainu were assimilated by the Japanese, and some mixed with the Russian population of the Far East. At the moment, the Ainu living in Russia, while preserving their identity, are not included in the list of indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East and are fighting for the inclusion of the Ainu people in the state document of the Russian Federation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And One in the Field is a Warrior","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
