His actions are brave yet extreme in every way. Recognising this, the commander promotes the boy to section head, even though all his men are older than he is. He takes the most dangerous missions and as a result, one of his men dies. The late manâ€™s girlfriend then volunteers, and is also killed, after being just as reckless as the boy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":166027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Djabar Film","origin_country":""},{"id":79527,"logo_path":"/ecBbf5b0KNPrOjo5GZVch2dbmUf.png","name":"PT.
