The Africatown residents in Mobile, Alabama, have shared stories about their origins for generations. Their community was founded by enslaved ancestors who were transported in 1860 aboard the last known and illegal slave ship, Clotilda. Though the ship was intentionally destroyed upon arrival, its memory and legacy weren’t. Now, the long-awaited discovery of the Clotilda’s remains offers this community a tangible link to their ancestors and validation of a history so many tried to bury.","popularity":4.809,"poster_path":"/sHd1OBpWLxSN5UPSJrjwYeT4PPZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6735,"logo_path":"/pAQW38WU8ychBvYU2aGPTEbynEN.png","name":"Participant","origin_country":"US"},{"id":125345,"logo_path":"/z3Ly3BKafB4PUkvVmkTwLQ8V8yS.png","name":"Concordia Studio","origin_country":"US"},{"id":156793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Two One Five Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The past is always present.","title":"Descendant","video":false,"vote_average":6.524,"vote_count":21}
