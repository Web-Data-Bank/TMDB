Chol Soo Lee, a 20-year-old Korean immigrant who had previous run-ins with the law, was arrested and convicted based on flimsy evidence and the eyewitness accounts of white tourists who couldn’t distinguish between Asian features. Sentenced to life in prison, Chol Soo Lee would spend years fighting to survive behind bars before journalist K.W. Lee took an interest in his case. The intrepid reporter’s investigation would galvanize a first-of-its-kind pan-Asian American grassroots movement to fight for Chol Soo Lee’s freedom, ultimately inspiring a new generation of social justice activists.","popularity":2.082,"poster_path":"/pHCap0mMQvvnBDNs7u63QxiK6dm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128976,"logo_path":"/6ZfJiskmTdzvYs8861ynrFNMSzk.png","name":"XTR","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":139944,"logo_path":"/AhidH8FFYTAzexStLcJNQg2Tree.png","name":"Center for Asian American Media (CAAM)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Chol Soo Lee","video":false,"vote_average":7.25,"vote_count":8}
