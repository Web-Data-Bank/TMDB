Barcelona, 1977. Manuel, a young accountant, imprisoned and awaiting trial for embezzlement, faces a sentence of 6 to 8 years, a disproportionate punishment for the crime committed. Together with his cellmate Pino, he joins forces with COPEL, a collective fighting for the rights of ordinary prisoners and amnesty. A war for freedom breaks out that will bring the Spanish prison system to its knees. If things are changing outside, they’ll have to do the same inside. A tale of friendship, solidarity and freedom, inspired in true events.","popularity":18.836,"poster_path":"/8NmaPNP3NS0Ok6sL1fT6ZSnw5OF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7342,"logo_path":"/wNfgwQ0kzY74pSAf8mmguPI5nHX.png","name":"Atípica Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":67412,"logo_path":"/vgVqq5hunVs8GN5Je9d9rG7Q2NU.png","name":"Movistar+","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prison 77","video":false,"vote_average":7.36,"vote_count":75}
