The portraits give an insight into the subjective environment of the protagonists and their conflicts in this field still dominated by men. The protagonists tell about their diferent paths to electronic music and its impact on their lives. Captured by the camera, the movie draws a fascinating portrait not only of the three protagonists but also of Berlin, Feminism, Nerdity, queer life, the love for music, the aspiration for self-fulfilment and Djing as a profession.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yKlghXO4XIBLGqnWdwZsH63iMu1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sounds Queer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
