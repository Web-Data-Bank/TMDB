Over the last year the tide has become a tsunami. As Beth goes through her shift, the stakes rise: is this the night she will lose someone? Save someone? Eventually, Beth’s own story comes to light, revealing why she does it. All along we remain with her: listening, comforting, connecting – patching the world back together, one stitch at a time.","popularity":2.049,"poster_path":"/2GI2mJVrrCOI8Dtjhx7vMy4FTDY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180894,"logo_path":"/zqhACjyF9HUAnpaB3Qav7b3Iw3x.png","name":"Hantz Motion Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":99963,"logo_path":"/wi5JP4jpVBeb9qK97nhICkMurNZ.png","name":"Sight Unseen Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":180895,"logo_path":null,"name":"Olive Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":141828,"logo_path":"/x5YUWcJknvgnNXxX3jCmDxpB1YA.png","name":"Atlas Industries","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Listener","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
