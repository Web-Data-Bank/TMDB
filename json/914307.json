DisObey explores thinking around human rights, politics, activism, terrorism, youth crime and prevention, anti-social behavior, crime and deviance, social inclusion/exclusion, participation and representation. DisObey attempts to expand (and contract) definitions and interpretations of The Law. DisObey features Jason Warr, a criminologist from the University of Lincoln. Jason calls for a re-ordering of society: a recognition that we need to change our thinking and behavior radically in order to create a society that is truly fair and just for all. Jason also discusses his personal relationship with The Law as someone who has served 13 years in prison: Jason was imprisoned at the age of 17.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disobey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
