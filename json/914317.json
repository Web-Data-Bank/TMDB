La La La La asks questions about the rights of elderly individuals with dementia, living in care: What does it mean to be a citizen if you are dependent and living in care? How can people authentically and without prejudice express themselves while suffering from dementia and/or Alzheimers? What role does artmaking play within the care home environment? Many hours of audio interviews were conducted by myself and Dr. Mabel Lie, ethnographer attached to the project, to carry out this research. La La La La features five residents, who live in a care home for people with dementia. The hours of interviews and recordings have been collaged together to present multiple narratives simultaneously. Fragmentation, overlapping: a conflux of information, visually and aurally, collide in this work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La La La La","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
