A structural film with content, each roll contains layers of sexual illusion amid subliminal messages created by in-camera effects. The soundtrack starts from a single cat's purr and is manipulated with each sexual act, creating a climatic fever sounding like a buzzing chainsaw.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tjGQj4BT9dzXr238rfGRd2OYAqk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safer Sexual Techniques in the-Age of Mechanical Reproduction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
