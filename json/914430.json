This is a story of life put on “repeat”, story of permanent loss and discovery. My father lives in Donetsk and started losing his memory when armed hostilities began. Now he can`t remember the latest 10 minutes of his life. I come home after I haven`t seen my parents for a year. I talk to Dad, trying to pull out some of his memories through music, books and family stories. We can hear the shelling far off. But that is not the worst - even harder is the loss of memory, gradually taking my Dad away from his family and his past, squeezing the world to a few simple and important things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aQI28EbJqQE3ouC2xtpABGQWCCz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Bastille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
