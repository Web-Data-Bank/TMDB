But Crusoe cannot overcome the shackles of his own heritage and upbringing and is incapable of seeing Friday as anything other than a savage who needs Crusoe's brand of cultural and religious enlightenment. Friday attempts to share his own more generous and unashamed culture, but ultimately realizes that Crusoe can never see him as anything but an inferior being. With that awareness, Friday sets out to turn the tables on Crusoe.","popularity":3.946,"poster_path":"/mUIEf2Zce3PXJz37pWsTezTHU8K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keep Films","origin_country":""},{"id":18742,"logo_path":"/krQ8RCXPmQHmJ50gTEplxg3p588.png","name":"ABC Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1155,"logo_path":"/rKTzFu5woCo8k0u9ML7mWeLY541.png","name":"ITC Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man Friday","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":25}
