Oftentimes images are obscured by light flashes. I saved many of these short segments when filming and living in Chicago. All of these are spliced together creating a visual diary of my time spent there with my wife Susan. The time period was from 1971-1979. Most of the imagery is from our Chicago days with a couple of scenes from San Francisco. Since the images are flashes and this is a look backward, I titled this short Flashbacks.\" --DA.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1KzvNl40FmlRnFrev95XRk72KuE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flashbacks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
