A police officer, a prosecutor, a judge, and a forensic scientist conspire to manufacture evidence against murderers who they are convinced are guilty, but they lack the full proofs. When a criminal defense attorney threatens to expose their illicit activities, one of the group murders him. The police officer, who was opposed to the killing, is framed for the lawyer's murder and sentenced to life in prison. With this backstory in place, five years later he escapes prison and kidnaps the entire jury who convicted him, as well as his former judge, prosecutor and scientist allies. He assembles them all at a Jewish temple - the scene of the lawyer's murder - and proceeds to prove his innocence to them, while at the same time exacting just a bit more vigilante justice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qT37lOy1dkQ1Z8Lr2fYNmL0hDlH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17640,"logo_path":null,"name":"Justice for All Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Green Apple Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Corrupt Justice","title":"American Criminal","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
