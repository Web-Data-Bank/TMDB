We simply wouldn't be here without it. In this poetic short film, we explore our relationship with it, allowing the ocean to speak to us, while wondering how we can best respond to the questions it makes us ponder. Will we ever be able to change our destructive behavior towards its environment? Perhaps we can only do so by understanding our relationship with it and remembering the deep connection we seem to have forgotten about.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q8R6ucVOXgu4WNJ7AbMHubvqDCX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A conversation with the ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
