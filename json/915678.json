The film humorously depicts the life that went awry from the main character. At home it is wrong, going out is wrong, this is wrong, so wrong. So he decided to just run away to Mecca. But with a cynical intent, that there may only be a peaceful life because it will only worship, not thinking about the economy.  Originally the title was Lari Ka Mecca, because it was forbidden by the film commissie, this is because the name Mecca is a holy place for Muslims that cannot be played with. So the title was changed to Lari Ka Arab, to keep it attractive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n56vY2KHJSEaltX4WTsuUYIj5NZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Halimoen Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1930-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lari Ka Arab","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
