The traces, marks, and imprints left on the tape were scanned and animated into a noisy moving image, overlaying with slow-motion footage from a platform from a train station. A mundane moment of time stretched into a poetic space where passenger's figure and movements reveal below the traces of the insignificant sticky tape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AaJVmtB1r0kGNa06fGvPeWBCa4U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sense Of Place","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
