From his early BoBo doll experiments through his work with phobias, to his recent work on self-efficacy, Bandura has given us a sense of how people actively shape their own lives and those of others.  Utilizing archival materials and newly shot visuals, students will be introduced to the vocabulary and innovative methods of this influential thinker. Dr. Bandura’s narration imbues this video with his compelling presentation style and intellectual authority.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uYceLAQakiLMQlNHToRSvSf9Hi4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Davidson Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory: An Introduction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
