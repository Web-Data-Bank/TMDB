Yitschak Spiegl was the foster daughter of a Czech mother, and was living as a woman when in 1988 he fled Communist Czechoslovakia. Fragments of his personal history emerge as he visits places in Austria with filmmaker Vita Soul Wilmering where he spent time as a refugee. Chance meetings with people on the street unintentionally form a recurring thread that links up themes of exclusion and pigeonholing, which shape the painful undertone of Spiegl’s life story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hqcA9kEPBkqp3hiL08R8DuwAEUO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiegl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
