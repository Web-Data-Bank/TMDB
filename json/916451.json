The screenplay of this film is based on the novel of the same title by Andon Zako Çajupi. In this work, the relationship between a 14-year-old boy (Gjino) with a 20-year-old girl (Marigo) becomes the fruit of the economic conditions of life in the mountain villages. Gjino's mother, Tana, is a peasant whose life conditions force her to insist on a marriage that does not bring happiness to her son. These qualities, united in a single character, make Tana an interesting type, merely a sketch of a character but lively, full of humour and colour, against the background of a typical rural life of the mountain villages in Southern Albania.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Përallë nga e Kaluara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
