In September 1987, two scrap collectors looking through an abandoned clinic (Goiânia Radiotherapy Institute) found an old radiotherapy device. Moved by curiosity with the machine, they took it to a junkyard, where they disassembled it and extracted a capsule containing a blue powder that glowed in the dark. From that night onwards, the radiation spread unseen throughout the city, contaminating more than a hundred people, leaving deep marks and traumas. From a collage of contaminated images, radioactive ghosts emerge, embedded in the history of that place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s665TKIQoqEWBqWj5ejL7IR6Lq2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137909,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barroca Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2022-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"After killing the dragon, Cadmus released the blue curse, spreading like dust into the city.","title":"Dragon Tooth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
