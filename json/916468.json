He is respected and liked in the industry and is known to be a man of honesty and principles. He feels that Varun should make a debut in one of his movies, which he decides to call \"Nagar Vadhu\" (Prostitute), and hopes to cast a well-known Bollywood actress, Sakhi Swami, opposite Varun in the female lead role. The only problem is that Varun dislikes acting, but when Raj persuades him, he changes his mind, and agrees to act in this movie. Varun meets with Sakhi, and both are attracted to each other. This does not auger well with Raj and he puts a stop to the production immediately. It is then that Varun finds out that his principled father has been known to have an illicit relationship with Sakhi. How will this knowledge help him overcome the wall of mistrust that has now arisen between his dad, himself, and Sakhi.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sMH0yWUaHK8gZZ6Dh094WjjzLtc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43701,"logo_path":null,"name":"U.K. Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Khudai","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
