Shot in Berlin, a city whose borders were formed and defined by the political and historical climate of post-war Germany. This film has no narrative, it is a journey throuth the city using the 'jump-cut' and 'cinematic time' to move from the past to the present and the present to the past. Trains, airplanes and pesdestrians now move freely through what was a 'divided' city.  This film was originally projected onto a shop window in an Edinburgh street in December as part of a Lght Festival celebrating the European Summit in 1992.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Festung Europa - Shifting peripheries","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
