It was professionally recorded and upon delivery the hard drives had been mislaid. When it was rediscovered we immediately set about editing and finishing the show. And the final product is a wonderful example of the \"Outright King of Live Comedy\" on top of his game. It's also a fine reminder of what life was like before the pandemic.  The show contains scenes of hugging, kissing, high fiving, dry riding, casual exchange of bodily fluids and a 1000 people packed into a room laughing their hoops off.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fktvp28WypYuN1OrO21qlHn4IOK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jason Byrne's Lost Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
