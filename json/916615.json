Fun and tremendous, operating in iconographic cannibalism. It is a work that shows another reading of the national holiday, demystifying it. Confronts the Spanish bullfighting culture with the visions and uses of the bull in other civilizations. This video creation immerses itself in the aesthetic, ritual and cultural universe of the world of bullfighting, rebuilding it critically, but at the same time with healthy irony.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dhEc7mqUr0tE20ihXzcqnaNHZvO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132556,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTVA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La cosa nuestra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
