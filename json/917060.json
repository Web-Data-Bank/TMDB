It explores a state of misgiving between two characters with different world views: a domesticated, fenced-in American dachshund (Jerry) and a wilder, free-running Scottish sheepdog (Kep). Hope fuels a state of ongoing discomfort as the pair seek to connect. The film was the outcome of a year-long artist's residency coordinated by ACES (Aberdeen Centre for Environmental Sustainability) and The University of Aberdeen, funded by Creative Scotland. The residency brought together artists, natural and social scientists and ecologists to examine issues of environmental conflict and to explore conflict resolution. The screenplay was developed collaboratively by artist filmmaker Matt Hulse and Professor of Geography Bill Adams. US documentary director Elizabeth Lawrence provides the voice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Together Apart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
