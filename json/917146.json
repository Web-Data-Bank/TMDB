The eight-time first-ballot Pro Bowler can go from clearing 5-foot-high box jumps to beating future Hall of Fame running back Adrian Peterson in footwork drills. The 6’5”, 320-pound native of Longview, Texas, is also a skilled hooper, capable of 360-degree dunks and a nasty crossover akin to Allen Iverson’s. Now, the San Francisco 49ers offensive tackle—known as the “Silverback” for his size and speed—is authoring one of the most miraculous comeback stories in NFL history.","popularity":1.476,"poster_path":"/xonccdGxPzy9O2f5yG9D7f1cse4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166447,"logo_path":null,"name":"CloseUp360, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SILVERBACK: The Trent Williams Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
