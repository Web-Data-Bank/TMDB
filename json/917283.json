It is a video that consists of three chapters divided by each album that the rapper published in his career, but all three connected by its plot. Ozelot's work is a marvel from beginning to end, it would not be enough to make a video like this to unmask everything that the rapper anchored to his music and the pure thought of each song, even. An attempt has been made through inference to make a connection of points that try to make sense of Ozelot's albums Singularity, Dimensiones y Cuerdas and El hombre de masa cero, creating a chronological plot regarding the order of the themes within the albums.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ozelot: el rapero que comprendió el Todo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
