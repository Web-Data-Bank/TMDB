Follow along as the company embarks on its remarkable creative journey and take a deep dive into the psyches of the company’s founders (Donovan Zimmerman and Jan Burger), and the diverse group of artists who help bring the show to life.  Shot primarily on a single camera and with no budget in Saxapahaw and Chapel Hill, NC, We Are Here is a 55-minute documentary that investigates the intention and process of a community whose aim is to move us to action through moving art.  It takes a whole lot more than cardboard, wood, duct tape, and string to make a great show. In We Are Here, we find out what makes a puppet come to life and we are challenged to reconsider our own place in the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iGxdbdLzG0hhzX5UrheJNY7NPUG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film about artists trying to save the world.","title":"We Are Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
