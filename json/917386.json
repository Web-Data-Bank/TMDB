We can hear the murmur of delegates gathering in the room. There are more and more people. The words of the speech are barely audible, but one may presume that an important member of the party talks to the working people. The delegates, wearing the same suits, smile approvingly. The camera moves to the B seats. The delegates sitting there grid their teeth, pout and frown. They comment on the speech quietly, they hide their anger. A look at the A seats, the delegates sitting there are really pleased with the speech. An animated story by Miroslaw Kijowicz, a director, scriptwriter of animated films, set designer and educator. An ordinary man was usually the protagonist of Kijowicz's philosophical short films. The situations presented in the films were rather general, they were supposed to provide food for thought. \"A-B\" obviously refers to the growing political crisis of the second half of the 1970s and Orwellian doublethink.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gbKCTxanoZqYSuPwXCds4LY8LyY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Miniatur Filmowych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1978-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A - B","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
