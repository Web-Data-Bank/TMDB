Tomasz Dominik and Piotr Rozbicki capture interesting, distinctive details - an unusual balcony, inscriptions on the walls, beautiful but dilapidated architectural details - from the gray reality of shabby tenement houses, blocks of flats, squalid courtyards. In the background we can observe the political, economic and cultural context of the period: lifestyle, cars, clothes, texts on walls. In the public space the sphere of the sacred mixes with the profane.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l1wG04rqNLOF1WUCnfqpDV4shIh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warsaw 88-89","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
