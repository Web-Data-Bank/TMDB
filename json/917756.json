Total Football","overview":"Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten, The brothers Koeman… These were some of the superstars from Holland whose blazing talents made the European Championship of 1988 so memorable and one to log indelibly in the whole recent legend of outstanding international football.\r Eight teams qualified for the tournament finals, including England who scored more goals than any other side, 18, to reach the final stages – and the Cinderella side from the Republic of Ireland, managed by Jack Charlton.\r But most of all Euro ’88 had a winning side who swept all before them in a colourful and passionate series of displays that will be viewed again and again by anyone fascinated and intrigued by the way the world’s most popular game is so sumptuously developing as it enters its second organised century. It is a must for fans and serious students alike.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rMfSVS3k6Op7j4QED7kvWoUqm37.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166545,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Sport and Leisure (ISL)","origin_country":""},{"id":166546,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung","origin_country":""},{"id":74310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Worldmark","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The official film of the 1988 UEFA European Football Championship.","title":"Tor!
