He takes serious action and sells his suit to a simple guy who has long since lost his sense of \"New Year's magic\". By leaving his position as a magician, Santa deprives people not only of a festive mood, but also of snow that could contribute to this. But contrary to his views on the hopelessness of the modern generation, people notice the changes and become the creators of a real New Year's miracle on their own.","popularity":0.878,"poster_path":"/iNztrmt6nzM1XTgc6M7atmd4NTW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Device Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Real Santa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
