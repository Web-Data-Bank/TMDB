Before long, she was leading the Auntie Sewing Squad, a work-from-home sweatshop of hundreds of volunteers—including children and her own mother—to fix the U.S. public health care system while in quarantine. It was a feminist care utopia forming in the midst of crisis. Or was it a mutual aid doomsday cult?  As the demand for masks abates and we begin to return safely to space, Kristina is beginning to put her life together post-pandemic cult leadership. With hilarity and boundless generosity, she invites the audience in on her work building community in isolation, while reflecting on what we’ve been through and imagining what we want to become.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/gbjFviYZSvSM1J4zpWiXlhnpUws.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143870,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Theatre Workshop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
