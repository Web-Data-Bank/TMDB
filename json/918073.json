Remember when cutting edge technology was pressing a button and seeing a little man throw out milk cans? That we were dazzled and would never forget such simple goings on is difficult to explain to today's kids. And most of our toy train stories began on a Christmas morning a long time, and this video captures that magic.  Features both Lionel and American Flyer vintage and modern toy trains in action mixed with reminiscences by collectors and operators of receiving trains for Christmas and the important role toy trains play at Christmastime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4XYAAFoCduOQEmvKz4pD543Sciu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christmas Toy Train Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
