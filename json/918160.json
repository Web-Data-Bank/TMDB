From the isolation of her Chicago apartment, she reconstructs his annual Christmas Carol puppet show – over a Zoom call while the family celebrates Christmas Eve under lockdown. But as Trudy becomes more absorbed in her own version of the story, the puppets take on a life of their own, and the family’s call transforms into a stunning cinematic adaptation of Dickens’s classic ghost story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v6EyNXl8qcaYQ7NyQgiO2zlskVq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manual Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manual Cinema's Christmas Carol","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
