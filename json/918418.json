Meanwhile, the Turkish-Cypriot population is aging, silently and away from the spotlight, on disputed and over-militarized lands. This war no longer concerns them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/63nzHgv55mXyiEkLpwiuyoAIDkB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169265,"logo_path":"/ff7BwnT6Y4bad9UuDzGnGUNY4eu.png","name":"Fjord Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Roar of Their Engines","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
