Culled from 16mm prints found in Something Weird’s attic, SMUT WITHOUT SMUT: SATANIC HORROR NITE is an exclusive feature-length mixtape curated by the Lucifer-worshipping maniacs at the American Genre Film Archive (AGFA). Best viewed during the witching hour at a haunted drive-in, this mixtape features “Smut Without Smut” versions of six Satan-themed features, as well as trailers, commercials, and ephemera from the vaults. WATCH! Demon killers wearing makeup in the style of the band KISS! SEE! Sacrificial rites performed on kitchen tables! OBSERVE! Credits like “Co-starring Raquel Belch!” Dreamy, outrageous, and filled with naked people wearing velvet capes, SMUT WITHOUT SMUT: SATANIC HORROR NITE is a spicy treat for those souls who are brave enough to jump into the fire.","popularity":0.672,"poster_path":"/flY7I5eSbQtfDoE0LzJbxIqsP21.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110219,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Genre Film Archives","origin_country":""},{"id":70320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Something Weird Video (SWV)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smut Without Smut: Satanic Horror Nite","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
