Through the stories of three CODAs, discover how the unique upbringing of hearing children born to deaf parents can be considered both a burden and an opportunity and how it shapes who they are and who they become. Also hear from the parents themselves about how their condition unwittingly puts an impossible weight of responsibility on their children, who are forced into adulthood from the moment they learn to talk.  Mother, Father, Deaf offers a previously unseen portrayal of contemporary reality for deaf families. Their stories, while deeply personal, mirror the experiences of CODAs around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c3ZXhCGiS0IGYBXDib2g10tYcle.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreamscape Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2019-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother, Father, Deaf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
