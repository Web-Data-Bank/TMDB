She meets an elusive man, Schumacher, who requests her to decrypt the puzzles left behind by her grandfather — clues that can lead to a cure for cancer. While Rudrani, along with her engineer husband Priyam, takes on the challenge, what she doesn’t realise is that she is getting sucked into a pool of dangerous international conspiracy. In a race against time, Rudrani and Priyam must uncover the clues to the antidote of a dreaded virus that challenges the very existence of mankind. From 1943 Germany to the hidden secrets of Swastika, from secret societies to novel viruses, from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose to Adolf Hitler, the adaptation is a mind-boggling adventure across the United Kingdom, Eskay Movies’ home away from home.","popularity":0.677,"poster_path":"/96EdBUG0BNjcazIQUbo7pFIrsLf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18905,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eskay Movies","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":179081,"logo_path":null,"name":"SSB Talkies","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2022-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Old war, New Weapons.","title":"Swastik Sanket","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
