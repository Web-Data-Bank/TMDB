It is told entirely through the hilarious, rueful, self-reflective words of sixteen diverse parents (of newborns to six-year-olds) and would-bees, living in Toronto and London, Ontario. They take different sides on every controversy (known donors v frozen, liking clinics or hating them, how much biology matters, being ‘two mommies’ or ‘a mom and an other parent’, seeing homophobia everywhere or nowhere), but they are all passionately articulate about this strange new world of queer family-making.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Immaculate Conceptions: Inside a Lesbian Baby Boom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":1}
