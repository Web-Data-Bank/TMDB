It is through their inner voices that I try to paint a sensitive and subjective portrait of contemporary Lebanon. I also witnessed the gradual emergence of a third character, the city of Beirut, which is constantly being destroyed and rebuilt, and which carries within itself the heritage of their past. Beyond a confrontation between inner truth and objective reality, this film is a reflection on violence and interrogates the need to see and produce images of destruction, thereby echoing the war photojournalism of Patrick Baz.","popularity":0.821,"poster_path":"/lQFIC11QT1AfV2dx6M4yllz91EH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sur tes cendres","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
