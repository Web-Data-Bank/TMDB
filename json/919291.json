Long assumed to be a work of fiction, recent archaeological discoveries are beginning to reveal a legend that may have been inspired by fact.  Jason is supposed to have travelled east to the mythical land of Kolchis at the ends of the earth. Modern findings suggest that the real Jason was an ancient Greek mariner who led a crew of courageous mariners nearly 2000 miles to the far eastern shore of the Black Sea in search of trade â€“ an audacious voyage into the unknown in nothing more than a small open ship.  Using high-quality CGI effects to illustrate the adventures of Jason and his brave companions, and with contributors including historians, archaeologists and economists, this fascinating documentary looks behind the ancient myth to try and uncover the reality behind a story that has inspired three millennia of poetry and art and Hollywood films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hAqLwq0K4hrCGX2VmVSBwTgCInN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8172,"logo_path":"/z8wiYrvJAwbm2jcPSj8qVqWh4RP.png","name":"Atlantic Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Long shrouded in legend, this documentary examins recent archaological evidence suggesting that the story of Jason and the Argonauts may be more fact than fiction.","title":"The Real Jason and the Argonauts","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
