It's like a space-time capsule, carrying a period of time that I have experienced first-hand but have no memory. August 22, 2020, on your first photo, you are a dark area of 0.3 x 0.4 x 0.3cm. I miss you all the time, although most of the time, I can't see you. These 40 weeks are a period of time when you and I have experienced together but can't be remembered by you in the future. I hope to keep this memory for you.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yGKm0kzDYJUB3Rb3YX7mDDOoiQe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories of the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
