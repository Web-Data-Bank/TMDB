Before long, Lizuca's father comes to take her away to live with him and his new bride, a vile woman who considers children the bane of all existence. Lizuca and the dachshund escape the wicked stepmother and spend the night in a hollow tree, a tree that changes into an enchanted land where Lizuca (like Alice through the Looking Glass) discovers a world of characters in the form of bees, frogs, the four seasons, Snow White, her dwarves, and other fairy tale creatures. This magic place is threatened by the evil stepmother's plan to sell the grove that protects the secret land to developers -- a decision that puts the woman on trial before this perfidy can be realized.","popularity":1.847,"poster_path":"/wR3x6dSKDA3kUOCk45VQreANsYU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centrul de Producție Cinematografică București","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A little girl and her dog in a enchanted journey","title":"The Enchanted Grove","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":11}
