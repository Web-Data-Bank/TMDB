Carlos (along with his over the top athletic drumming)... and the sheer virtuosity and comic weirdness of guitarist Rick Nielsen, whose searing guitar lines ad flamboyant physical energy are matched only by his deliberately goofball geek look-presaging punk rock while playing like Jimmy Page.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheap Trick: Live Tokyo 1978","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
