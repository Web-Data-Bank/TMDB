About fifty, balding, paunchy, Robert spends most of his time locked in the garage where he tries to develop a teleport machine.  Robert will try to teleport himself, but a fly is stuck in the machine, and the scientific apprentice will gradually turn into a giant insect. Robert will little by little dehumanize to become a beast able to climb the wall, pushed by an insatiable search for food.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gYAlb17aa8B1txOaAI4Y0c0uPHb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wahoo Production","origin_country":""},{"id":166821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre International de Créations Théâtrales","origin_country":""},{"id":166822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord","origin_country":""},{"id":166823,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Point Fix","origin_country":""},{"id":166824,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Copat","origin_country":""},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":136701,"logo_path":null,"name":"OLYMPIA TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A laboratory of scenic and visual experiments","title":"The fly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
