As a tapestry of footage collected from surveillance cameras over the last four years, Self-Portrait moves from moment to moment around the world, beginning with the frozen storminess of winter, to the melt of spring, the lush heat of summer, and finally the decay and cooling of autumn: the dawn of winter. The film shows a candid peek at humanity through what we've chosen to document – all of these cameras set up for primarily capitalistic, \"property\"-protecting purposes, but yielding a beauty and a truth – an incidental portrait.","popularity":1.145,"poster_path":"/3Z2pMmR2KTF3nUgq7mPrNTdJew9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
