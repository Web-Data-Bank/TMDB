The work is a return to something we once felt and a repetition of something we had never experienced. It charts the path of an Ensō (a special circle form in Zen Buddhism), a depiction of a “whole” or a “void”, a different cosmology, depending on the way you look at it, up-close or at a distance. The circle in the video holds together the improvised elements of free jazz and the disparate footnotes found in fortunes opened at random. It sets the stage for a gathering of friends and proposes that waiting can be a form of love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Setting the Stage for a Gathering of Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
