Odd, unconventional and unusual - these are animals that don't normally grab the limelight. From the parrot that has forgotten how to fly, to the bear that has turned vegetarian, a chameleon that is barely bigger than an ant, and a penguin that lives in a forest. Nature's Misfits reveals the extraordinary and rarely seen lives of these evolutionary oddballs, their strange habitats, unusual forms, and the incredible hurdles they overcome.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nature's Misfits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
