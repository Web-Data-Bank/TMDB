Located in a glass manufacture, the film follows the transition of the amorphous matter from its molten state to a wine glass. The meticulous choreography of their interrelated actions grants the craftsmen’s labour an hypnotic allure. As the making of the glasses takes us through the different stages of their fabrication, the customary production cycle is hijacked by an unusual slip: the intervention of a magician who bends the wine glasses, bestowing upon the assembly line the traits of an enchanted realm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xP4mm8lMIASdlZ1N0lbM7GeUz32.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slip of the Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
