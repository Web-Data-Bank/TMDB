Their lives uncertain and at the risk of being denounced by their neighbours or relatives, they transmitted confidential information, disseminated anti-Nazi leaflets, and saved Jews from deportation. When arrested, they were imprisoned, deported, or even executed; after 1945 - despite their acts of bravery - these women were forgotten - now some of these heroines are emerging from the shadows. Among them are propaganda ministry official Libertas Schulze-Boysen, journalist Ruth Andreas-Friedrich, and student Sophie Scholl.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nnmMWo0jYkhN24JoetTMjwjfBHn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Women Who Fought Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
