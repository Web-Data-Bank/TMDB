But their success in reducing crime, and making their \"campus\" a magnet for art enthusiasts, families, and local residents, also attracts deep-pocket real estate developers.  Their bold response is to include community planning and new housing as a part of their art practice. If they can shape an area in Third Ward for the residents, there's a chance they can keep the neighborhood intact.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Third Ward TX","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
