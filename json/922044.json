Bedrooms across the land were being adorned with the rock and roll imagery of one band; Guns ‘N’ Roses. It was at this time that the band were invited to the iconic stage of CBGB’s, the home of punk.  Rather than lay down a rip-roaring set of leather-clad rock and roll the band instead put together a stripped back acoustic set. Yet, despite their lack of electricity, they held the audience in the palm of their hands.  It was a few months after the release of Appetite For Destruction—the band’s breakthrough LP—when they were invited to play the small CBGB club gig but the band were far from flying up the charts. In fact, with the record stalling at 65 on the charts, the group were intent on gigging around the circuit.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/9MC9FfGDVonwzzaj1kZG3BeXDOz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guns N' Roses:  Live at CBGB in New York","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
