To get unprecedented access to the Israel lobby’s inner workings, undercover reporter “Tony” posed as a pro-Israel volunteer in Washington. The resulting film exposes the efforts of Israel and its lobbyists to spy on, smear and intimidate US citizens who support Palestinian human rights, especially BDS – the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. It shows that Israel’s semi-covert black-ops government agency, the Ministry of Strategic Affairs, is operating this effort in collusion with an extensive network of US-based organizations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iDSuLGPKbNIhxxV3vPQ1EYZqtra.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Al Jazeera English","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":188,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Watch the film the Israel lobby didn’t want you to see","title":"The Lobby - USA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
