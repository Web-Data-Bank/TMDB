In her apartment, photos turned yellow by the passing time tell the adolescence of a boy who at the time was called Luciano and who was going to live the most terrible period of his life. Lucy is the oldest transsexual woman in Italy. She is among the few survivors of Dachau's concentration camp. Lucy's story tells us the story of the 1900s. The events of her turbulent life become a metaphor for a humanity that does not give up and that treasures the most important gift in history, memory, as a unique and irreplaceable starting point.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qn8ZK1PSHt0ShtqbkpzPcNrQKoS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Breath of Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
