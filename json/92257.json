To overcome these dreary thoughts, she decides to find out about him and the other men who danced with her during a ball that was a turning point in her life, many years ago. She pays a visit to those forgotten acquaintances one after the other; Christine is not only surprised to see how they have fared, but also discovers the impact she had, unknowingly, on the feelings and the destiny of these persons.","popularity":1.111,"poster_path":"/9cSKDlW2zatHjzXH786pCCXOTLw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Sigma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":148272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Vog","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1937-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un carnet de bal","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":22}
