We are making sure everyone who can not attend a live performance this Australian Summer can join us for the final show of the original line-up via a virtual concert.  We have so much to celebrate and canâ€™t wait to have you dancing along with us from your lounge room or backyard.  The party will get started with a special piano solo set from our very own Ollie McGill before we move into two hours of The Cat Empire.  We have a set-list jam-packed with favourite songs from our entire career. Expect an unforgettable celebration with plenty of reflection and immeasurable joy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cat Empire: Virtual Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
