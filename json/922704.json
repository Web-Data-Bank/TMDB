Acconci offers critical perspective of the personal and public contexts of his work.  Major works from many phases of his production are presented in this discussion (Following Piece, Seedbed, Claim, Reception Room, Instant House).  Within the dialogue, Acconci tracks variations in his approaches to the roles of power, body, physical space, and the private/public divide within his art. He also evaluates the ways in which the movements of conceptualism and process art entered his practice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vito Acconci: An Interview","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
