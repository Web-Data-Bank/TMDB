I normally project the work as film inside galleries and museums, and occasionally cinemas. I have always been steadfast about showing my films in the medium with which they were made and were always intended to be shown. I have therefore never allowed them to be streamed online or ever projected digitally. Film is a very different way of making and seeing a work, and over the years, I have campaigned to keep photochemical mediums available to artists and filmmakers, and I have found that I have done this best this by continuing to make and show my works in and on film.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Event for a Stage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
