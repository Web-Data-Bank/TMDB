In the rolling foothills of Alberta, the colts and horses run free with wild grace and speed, until it’s round-up time. Some are destined for the Calgary Stampede, the most exciting time for cowboys and ranchers who compete in the dusty ring to win at roping, bronco-busting, bulldogging a steer, and chuck-wagon racing, risking life and limb.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1946-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bronco Busters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
