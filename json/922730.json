Strangely self-absorbed, she is struggling with indecipherable little stuff in her palm (while Stalin's portrait rests casually under her arm). As the soundtrack, we hear Beethovenâ€™s Marmot played slightly out of tune, diligently and naively, by a child.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marmot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
