The piece takes us back in time, or rather brings the past back to life, a hundred years after these bodies, faces and eyes were caught by the camera, and the city of Beirut, tinged with its rich Ottoman history, was filmed by unnamed cameramen - anonymous figures behind and in front of the camera. Arsmondo wanted to give these images a fresh life, a presence among us, and asked musician Sharif Sehnaoui to gather a group of Lebanese artists to create a musical backdrop.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Topologie d’une absence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
