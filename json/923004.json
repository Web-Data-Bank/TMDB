Each one - from the song of the largest lemur to the song of the humpback whale to the song of the lyrebird - was recorded in his lifetime.  When Sir David was born, the science of song had already been transformed by Charles Darwin’s theory of sexual selection: singing is dangerous as it reveals the singer’s location to predators, but it also offers the male a huge reward, the chance to attract a female and pass on genes to the next generation. Hence males sing and females don't.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/sHzpXG3m41dUi4uZ5w1Ypm5ULmH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mike Birkhead Associates","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Attenborough's Wonder of Song","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
