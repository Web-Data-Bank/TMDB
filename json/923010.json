Marcia has spent most of her 11 years living with her Jamaican grandmother but is sent to damp, dark London to start a new life with her parents. Missing her gran terribly, Marcia is surrounded by bullying schoolgirls, racism on TV and a jealous younger brother... Only her favourite pop star will help her feel at home.  Concrete Garden is a wonderfully observed graduation film from director Alrick Riley. With warm performances from a young cast and exquisite detail in the production design, this tender short film powerfully evokes the trials and tribulations faced by kids settling in 1950s Britain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dplVmZGUztTAqyJPeGp9S9U1ck4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17700,"logo_path":"/30KETxKJcX7cm65WymAKMYPP6C4.png","name":"NFTS","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concrete Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
