Yes that's right, this villain LOVES him some pussy plasma. When Geoffrey and his brood of sexy hoes unwittingly unleash the spirit of Desmond, the part-tay heats up in a menagerie of death and Jamaican Fury. Spit seed as you witness scantily clad women run willy nilly around your hearts and tug at your nut strings. Dance the death dance as you find out what happens when five school chums, a talking vagina and Michael Jackson have to stop a rampaging fiend, hell bent on sipping the women folk dry and ruling the world with a rasta filled fist. Take heed, foolish mortals. Nothing can prepare you for such terror and cheese. Strap yourselves in for an explosive ride through your own dementia. This IS Blood Trim.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oiI8CtAThdv1bL5Fs4peoRjnS8C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5540,"logo_path":null,"name":"Low Budget Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Trim: The Bleeding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
