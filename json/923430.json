Rather than overtly appearing in each film, Johnny Kline is more a summation of the evils within the film as a whole: he is a monstrosity of cinema. By composing fragmented narratives and drawing on an array of found materials the films of Johnny Kline form a visceral and furious passage through the underbelly of found-footage cinema, where Kline is both a master of ceremonies and a spectre behind and betwixt each frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8LlHuoSXnaIBZRJekxPkmOBOffK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friends with Johnny Kline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
