However, when these online platforms exist to fulfil sexual desires opposed to civil action, is the community at risk of being reduced to just sex? For two weeks I travelled the Balkans, meeting men on homosexual dating applications. We would go for coffee and then somewhere more private. I would interview them about what it is like to be a homosexual man in the Balkans. This film is a culmination of that journey and those men.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gkJb7QQWICwckFfB82BpXzKN0SX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Mermaids in the Balkans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
