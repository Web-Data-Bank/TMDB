This film is part of an ongoing project to show where I am in a (here, natural) landscape in a way that reflects those structures of thought. It is \"hypnogogic,\" not so much perceptually (although to some extent that too) as conceptually. Our eyes see constantly, but what do we actually notice? That vision is excessive, wasteful, even; in paring down, it becomes both more spare and more concentrated.  It is also a meditation in process of how my marvelous son Marcus has changed my life and my way of being in the world, recoloring a place where I was already.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aXdhxKNZktguoSYHwbh3nga7n5n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shadow of Marcus Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
