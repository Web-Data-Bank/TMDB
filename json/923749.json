The young man despairs at seeing his advances rejected and will not taste the love that the young woman comes to confess too late.  Adapted from Goethe's novel, Jules Massenet's opera Werther is a jewel of French lyric repertoire. Opéra Orchestre National Montpellier Occitanie shares the sober and elegant staging by Bruno Ravella – his Rosenkavalier was recently enjoyed on OperaVision – and invites the famous Canadian contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux to sing Charlotte for the first time, alongside a young and almost exclusively French-speaking cast conducted by Jean-Marie Zietouni.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/blsOzXxYcKi6tTk8hWzlrapRdyU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Werther - Montpellier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
