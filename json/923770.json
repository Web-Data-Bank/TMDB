Spectacular views of the Storehogen Mountain in VREID’s hometown of Sogndal, Norway and of Hellisheiði in SÓLSTAFIR’s native Iceland lay the majestic backdrop for this one-of-a-kind, 90-minute long digital streaming event.  Speaking about the livestream, SÓLSTAFIR‘s Aðalbjörn Tryggvason says, “playing live music in sideways rain on moss grown lava. They wanted something Icelandic. Doesn’t get any more Icelandic than this.”  VREID songwriter and bass player Jarle Kvåle adds, “SÓLSTAFIR‘s and VREID‘s stories are two parallel stories of the north. In this weird world, our paths have crossed on several occasions and this time they have merged into something new. This is the third streaming event VREID has done, and in many ways, it represents the end of a trilogy for us","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qNPMmOmTlpZ51ANwrZMCAprAtEv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SÓLSTAFIR and VREID present  Across  - A Cinematic Concert Experience","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
