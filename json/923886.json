Oil and water will never mix and it is this basic concept that has driven the production of this video work.  I wanted to create a situation where the two try and come together, despite the obvious outcome.  The physicality of oil and water will never allow this union and thus causes an interesting to and fro within the video frame.  The images have been mirrored and a combination of machine,electronic and organic sound create an almost abstract machine like structure, technology and nature come together in an exploration of force and pressure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vpRnmjHw9wTo2xqyFb7TudyAums.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oil and Water","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
