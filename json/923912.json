Nowadays, the traditional way of life of the Sámi people living in minority groups and their own identity inevitably arouse conflict with modern systems. To Anita Gimvall who is a Sámi tribe who has lived a lifetime in Lapland, it shows a cross-section of the recent arson incident in a traditional house. To the North for Nonexistence traces out a conflict and alienation at the ambiguous border between past tradition and modern life, settlement and deportation, thought and sharing, and stories of blurred boundaries and backgrounds inside and outside.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uQxix4lOsxnKx00ysczaxd4sL3k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To the North for Nonexistence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
