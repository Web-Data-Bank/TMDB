Alternating with the girls are black spaces and single frame shots of store mannequins, skeletons, dolls, etc. The sound track is applied with household bleach and a fine pen, rows of dots producing the actual sounds heard, a kind of rushing roaring, the way breathing sounds through a stethoscope. The sound is synchronized directly with any live shot, the black spaces being left silent, building to a kind of expectancy as shots continually shorten. â€“K.
