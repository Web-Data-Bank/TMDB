The presence of wind and sea and the fact that a third of the Netherlands is below sea level served as some of the main sources of inspiration for the Jalet.  Mist is part of a three project collaboration between Jalet and Japanese visual artist Kohei Nawa, following their critically acclaimed pieces VESSEL and PLANET [wanderer]. The work explores the ephemeral space between reality and mirage, and a physicality that recalls the dynamics of evaporating, condensing and falling water. For this creation, Jalet is also collaborating with choreographer Aimilios Arapoglou, composer Fennesz, lighting designer Urs Schonebaum, costume designer Sruli Recht and photographer and videographer Rahi Rezvani.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jvJN0SzHGX10V7E7BvgyXfV0CTU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nederlands Dans Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mist","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
