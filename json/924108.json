To make ends meet, he sublets a room in his apartment in a suburb of Santiago de Chile. However, he seems to have lost control when his housemate departs, leaving him with rent arrears, a collection of plants, a dog, a woolly jumper, and... a house ghost. Pablo is 30, and when it comes to romance he is also chasing apparitions. He is secretly still in love with his ex-boyfriend, a popular YouTuber.","popularity":2.309,"poster_path":"/xDoghTI6uSD2GVpT8FxhtluvSZ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Niña Niño Films","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2022-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pablo's new roommate is NOT all there.","title":"Phantom Project","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
