In Xian, China, getting remarried en masse is nothing unusual. It is also a celebration of what was previously impossible owing to socio-economic conditions. Now, however, elderly couple Li and Nie are facing up to death. In small ways and big: a dying female friend has her eye on a potential suitor for her husband; their fridge breaks down; the grave of Li’s deceased first wife has to be vacated. Guilt-ridden about her death, he gladly offers her a final resting place in the grave set aside for him and Nie. Maybe there will even be some space left, so Nie’s late husband can join them?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kixiIRuTGgAvDXnq2kqJjmgBvaf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Love Again","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
