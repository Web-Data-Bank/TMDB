The true number is likely much higher. One of the most violent and brutal cartels is the Sinaloa Cartel. In collaboration with 550BC, we got access to footage recently filmed by a Sinaloa Cartel foot soldier. The result is this short documentaryâ€”an unflinching look inside the lives of Sinaloa Cartel militiamen as they advance to launch attacks on rival cartels.  The cartels make billions of dollars a year from drug trafficking, and have a presence in every state in Mexico. They now have equipment similar to that of the Mexican military and are often considered to be narco-militias. This documentary shows you the harsh realities of their lifestyle.  Sinaloa Foot Soldier accompanies a book by 550BC that documents the lives of the Sicarios in more intimate detail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sRKzpeXCbHDC16i9SskWJe1rq2q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sinaloa Foot Soldier: Inside a Mexican Narco-Militia","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
