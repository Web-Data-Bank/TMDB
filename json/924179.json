El nombre de las cosas speaks aloud the unspoken and unspeakable, to give a name to traumas in order to heal them. Deeply poetic and disarmingly honest, director Diego Escobar uses his own story to address a widespread problem of inherited male aggression and all the ways families – and society – cope with and adapt to its toxicity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aGoerc9ShxOinISTC4ToBu2LLPQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2022-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Name of Things","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
