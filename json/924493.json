One of his first decisions was to break up the ORTF with the creation of three new television channels: TF1, Antenne 2 and FR3. Three new public channels but autonomous and competing. It is a race for the audience which is engaged then, and from now on the channels will make the war! This competition will give birth to a real golden age for television programs, with variety shows in the forefront. The stars of the song are going to invade the living rooms of the French for their biggest pleasure. This unedited documentary tells the story of the metamorphosis of this television of the early 1970s, between freedom of tone, scandals, political intrigues and programs that have become mythical.","popularity":0.752,"poster_path":"/8Heh90FuUdSPKT67UlWjA291bX3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121513,"logo_path":"/2k2sAvoWs8gGA7KiVdLr0AqKDUw.png","name":"ADLTV","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La TV des 70's : Quand Giscard était président","video":false,"vote_average":7.667,"vote_count":3}
