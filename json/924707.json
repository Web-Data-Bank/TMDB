They were held and tortured at the ESMA - the School of Naval Engineering and were never seen again. Moving tale based on letters Alice Domon sent to her family and friends back home as well as on the testimony of many friends in Argentina who remember her humanity and courage. She shared the lives of those in need, helped heeling their sick and bringing in their crops. And she raised their political awareness - which brought her to the attention of the regime. A film retracing recent history that is by no means in the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zX9CJLbYRcxtiqbgLtSTTOcALLY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Ojo","origin_country":""},{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yo sor Alice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
