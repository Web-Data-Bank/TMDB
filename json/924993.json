The time limit on their paradise of university is drawing to a close, and they are all feeling impatient in their own ways. Keiko is unable to find a job. Ueda is unsure of Keiko's feelings. Koike is torn between her dream of becoming a novelist and the reality of finding a job. The summer is passing. As if to hold on to their time in paradise, they enjoy a late night of fireworks. In his dreams, Koike sees a strange family picture. The image of the three of them sitting around a make-shift table on a riverbank overgrown with summer grass softly and unobtrusively conveys to the viewer their anxiety about their ambiguous future. The film's sincere image of adolescence is heartbreaking.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/glTJVxwfYrpJSY72mmtGTEWsLHF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flower","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
