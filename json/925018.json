But do the two popular North Sea islands have anything else in common? Judith Rakers wants to find out and discovers the beauties of the islands through the people she meets there. On Norderney she enjoys the rehearsals of the \"Döntjes-Singers\" and a walk in the dunes. The crossing to Föhr has to be earned: Judith Rakers lends a hand on a crab cutter. Afterwards there is a crash course in Frisian at the island radio station \"FriiskFunk\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Abid7jVe4RCULbFPn0IDlqWlkl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Norderney und Föhr mit Judith Rakers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
