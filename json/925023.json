Rustic thatched roofs, striking windmills, a pleasant sea climate and all this in the middle of the Wadden Sea National Park, accessible only by plane or ship. Judith Rakers hires a crab cutter for the crossing. She learns that there are two types of Föhrer: The High German-speaking inhabitants of Wyk and the \"real Frisians\" in the western part of the island. The Frisians are supposed to be modest, reserved but determined. Judith Rakers experiences how they \"tick\" during her very different encounters on the island.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Abid7jVe4RCULbFPn0IDlqWlkl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Föhr … mit Judith Rakers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
