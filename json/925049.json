The business people and residents at Tibarg in Hamburg's Niendorf district are initially surprised and irritated, some even angry.  Here, of all places, where shopping arcades and department stores characterise a district, containers for refugees are to be set up. Here, of all places, where parking spaces are scarce anyway. Presenter and Tagesschau anchorwoman Judith Rakers has been there from the beginning, is on site again and again, observes what is happening, how the situation is changing in the middle of the residential and business district.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reportage - Flüchtlinge als Nachbarn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
