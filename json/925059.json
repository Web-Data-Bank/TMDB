It gets sporty with trail running at the Schlögener Schlinge with magnificent views of the natural wonder of Upper Austria; adventurous is the dive among pike and crabs in the blue-green Traun. Judith Rakers has a creative romp in the graffiti harbour of Linz; she enjoys Austria's culinary classics from apricot dumplings to Wiener Schnitzel and Sachertorte.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3pB32JDDDomfBHoOZ5xKVvtrbwd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donau-Reise – Von Passau nach Wien","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
