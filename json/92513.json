As well as competing for students, the two are locked in deadly combat for the hand of the local beauty, who seems to be pretty much the only woman in town. Into their conflict comes yet another master Kim, this time a kung fu expert (Kwon Oh Joong, “Damo”) who puts them both to shame with his dizzying skills and suave charm. Eventually, real danger arrives in the form of some unscrupulous land developers, forcing the three to join forces for the greater good.","popularity":1.898,"poster_path":"/eD6lxHHBzWE2j1depdJMHKxLTp0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3965,"logo_path":"/jJDiZYbl3Cf6qzMPbmsfSr9aEvI.png","name":"Taewon Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2007-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Kims","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":11}
