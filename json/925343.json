The Yellow Emperor summoned the mystic powers of the magical Kunlun Mirror and defeated Chi You, but Chi You’s ferocious black dragon Xietian managed to escape. The Yellow Emperor feared that Xietian would return to cause destruction to the world, so he requested Master Long Brow of the Green Mountain Sect to find the dragon and kill it. However, Xietian proved to be a far superior opponent for Master Long Brow. Exhausting all his life’s energy, Master Long Brow finally managed to trap the formidable dragon at the bottom of the lake on Wu Mountain with a magic seal. A thousand years later, the black dragon Xietian managed to break the seal to escape, and its first destination was to massacre the entire Green Mountain Sect for revenge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u4GUpzvocOVvk6LSgKVoHJQa8IR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ancient Beast of Kunlun Town","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
