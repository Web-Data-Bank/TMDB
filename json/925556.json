I don't know what kind of film I'm going to make, but I'm going to make it. The camera is set up in a room. He moves into a bigger room and tries to capture more of his everyday life, but eventually, he gets tired of playing with the camera alone and enlists three of his friends to join him in making three dramas. The filmmaker insists on showing a naked woman in the film, but before he can make up his mind, the camera returns to his room, where he struggles to make a film, and, unable to process it as his own expression, he calmly accepts his awkwardness. In this way, the audience can see the growth of the artist. In this two-hour film, the audience experiences unique complicity with the artist's growth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6T86pv1lDRYbiS7I6mySrZ2LDgk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"M.B.
