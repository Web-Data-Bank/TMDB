His timely intervention turns the tide of the fight, and unbeknownst to him, sets in motion a series of monumentally consequential events. Back in the city, Su has a more mundane problem to face—an enormous debt with the local book lender. To pay this off, he must peddle his remarkable skills as a physician. While Su would prefer to steer clear of the affairs of the martial arts world, a request from the Lord of Globe Castle is financially promising—and might gain him access to the Fantastic Academy, where he can feast his eyes on the Limitless Celestial Book. But treachery is afoot, and Su is soon drawn into a crisis that will rock the foundations of Heaven and Earth.","popularity":1.363,"poster_path":"/uMJ7lqwmwBatWFmpEYXtqAUFsEf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167680,"logo_path":null,"name":"霹靂國際多媒體股份有限公司","origin_country":""},{"id":4338,"logo_path":null,"name":"PiLi International Multimedia","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demigod: The Legend Begins","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
