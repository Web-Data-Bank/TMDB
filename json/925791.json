Tommi and Jaana have been together for eight years. Jaana avoids commitment and gradually her actions start to seem suspicious to Tommi. Tommi gets the feeling that all is not well in their relationship and hires private detective Niklas to investigate Jaana's private life. Niklas is an experienced and intense investigator, but his methods are eccentric. Niklas tries to find out everything Jaana does in her life, where she goes and who she meets. At the same time, Tommi struggles with his own suspicions and the question arises whether Jaana could be deceptive in a relationship after all, or whether Tommi is merely building a state of fear in his own mind.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/hZYLBhZOxTssqreRpDSLbw5BDAZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nordbron Productions","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deceived","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
