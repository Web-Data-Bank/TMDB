It opens with a dramatization of her first, amateur recording session, with young Lauren Frost playing a part described in the credits as \"Young Girl,\" though Streisand later refers to her as \"mini-me.\" Frost doesn't get too far before being joined by Streisand herself on a stirring version of \"Something's Coming\" from West Side Story. The rest of \"Act One\" traces Streisand's career from her club days to her movie performances. \"Act Two\" has less of a narrative structure, though it is equally autobiographical, with Streisand displaying and commenting on videos of herself performing with other stars and building up to the stroke of midnight with a combination of old, recent, and new specially written songs. At 57 that night, Streisand remains in good voice.","popularity":2.048,"poster_path":"/luVzc7YGkz7m2b3i2CxOV4yAAw2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sony Music Entertainment Visual Works Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":10691,"logo_path":"/qw2h6MQ5yG5WmilxsWsQiAaXwCq.png","name":"Columbia Records","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Barbra sings in the 21st Century!","title":"Barbra Streisand: Timeless, Live in Concert","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":8}
