Here, capital is synonymous with the individual’s ability, and innovation is the confounding keyword. At the same time, we get to know those who rent a little “pod” that barely offers space for a bed and desk, raising questions about how the entrepreneurial ideology affects us as people. Good Life reflects on a modern phenomenon, where community has become the product of a company, but which at the same time reminds us of other collectives from a completely different time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zMte46GB08snaXcyhmtU8C9i1O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
