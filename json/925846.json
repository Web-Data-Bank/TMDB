As Maud now comes back to them, they have been together for 25 years, have three more or less grown-up children and are in the midst of a separation. Through charming flashbacks to the turbulent years with small children, shortly after the turn of the millennium and swooping down in the current relationship in transformation, a unique portrayal of life’s great undertakings – life-long love – arises. But how do you go on with life without your better half? How will the kids react and can a separation be the only way for love to survive?","popularity":0.719,"poster_path":"/8LTEitun5QE5rpJJZHrjXjKZAN1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love & Divorce","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
