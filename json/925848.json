The embroidery, depicting motifs from Sámi history, is also the starting point of Thomas Jackson’s documentary, which tells us about Sámi culture, whose history has been marked by a struggle against the majority population. The struggle has concerned the right to land and way of life, but also underlying this are two views of mankind and its relationship to nature. In Historjá – Stitches for Sapmí, historical events and mythological images are woven together with how climate change threatens contemporary reindeer herding and thus the existence of Sámi culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lJ23eBMw7JhpjR6j6uhTX8YW9Ap.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Northern Sami","iso_639_1":"se","name":""},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Historjá – Stitches for Sapmí","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
