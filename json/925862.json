The Swedish model for fighting Covid-19 in recent years has been discussed across the entire world, and its main figures have been the object of both hate campaigns and personality cults. Documentary filmmaker Viktor Nordenskiöld’s camera has followed the front figures of the crisis at conferences and everyday places. The result is a highly interested insight into the processes that have laid at the foundation of the controversial Swedish strategy, and how the medial and political pressure affected the decision-makers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5OEtvq6IXMJdLddT8cdRay96i8J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freetownfilms AB","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Swedish Model","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
