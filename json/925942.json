It's known for Tivoli, the Little Mermaid, the Royal Family etc. But Copenhagen also has a very different visual part. Everywhere around the city street-artists are adding their stories, emotions and expressions on the walls and tunnels. Copenhagen Remix is shot during the biggest \"fairytale\" event during the last four decades in Denmark: The royal wedding between Crown Prince Frederik and his Australian fianc√©e, Mary Donaldson. While the city is dressing up for the royal event, two local artists are working intensely in the streets with their arts. Meanwhile a desperate graffiti remover from the city council is trying to clean up the \"mess\" before the giant event.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bastard Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2005-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cph Remix","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
