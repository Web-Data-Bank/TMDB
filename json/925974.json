As a small Caribbean island, Cuba is disproportionately affected by climate change through extreme weather events. Up to 10% of Cuban territory could be submerged by the end of the century, wiping out coastal towns, polluting water supplies, destroying agricultural lands and forcing one million people to relocate. Finding solutions is now essential.  In this documentary, Dr Helen Yaffe goes to Cuba to find out about ‘Tarea Vida’ (Life Task), a long-term state plan to protect the population, environment and the economy from climate change. The Cuban approach combines environmental science, natural solutions and community participation in strategies for adaptation and mitigation.  Produced by DaniFilms with Dr Helen Yaffe from the University of Glasgow for the COP26 conference in Glasgow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aVsbKXEClH4TjmGPbliE4yc9ROx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dani Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cuba’s Life Task: Combatting Climate Change","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
