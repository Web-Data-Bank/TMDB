Armed with powerful male hatred, Seung-hye distanced herself from the men even by dividing the house in half, but her junior, Na-yeong, falls into the hands of Hyeon-joon, a wolf dressed in sheep's clothing.  Seung-hye hates men's genitals because male hatred is deeply ingrained in her brain. To this Seung-hye, she suddenly witnessed Soo-cheol's genitals. She tries to forget it, but the penis stuck in her mind and she can't unsee. She concludes that Soo-cheol \"fooled her into liking sex\" and treats Soo-cheol as a rapist.","popularity":3.135,"poster_path":"/5UJXsr7mC2Y524SdcSRkvYK7ZMr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mixed Living","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
