Those associated with the School were unified by their desire to create from within. They created a monumental, dramatic art that remains a singular expression of the crucial modern quest for individuality and personal freedom.\" Never knowing exactly how their pieces would turn out, the artists of the New York School embraced their own complex humanity and worked from a place of bold, sporadic realness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zBt8FUlaLHIAzs1P6kernIH42sx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New York School","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
