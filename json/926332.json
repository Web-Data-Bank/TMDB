She has moved back in with her mother Christina, a fragile, immature 55-year-old woman who blames Margaret, her firstborn, for ruining her dreams of a career as a concert pianist. In a state of unbridled fury during an argument, Margaret hits Christina. The law steps in, further complicating family dynamics. As she awaits trial, Margaret is forbidden from coming into contact with her mother or within 100 metres of their home. This only intensifies her desire to be closer to her family. Every day, Margaret appears at this 100-metre threshold to see her 12-year-old sister Marion and give her music lessons.","popularity":3.546,"poster_path":"/l8Z75B3US2McqgutlxtuqEvizrj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168344,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bandita Films","origin_country":""},{"id":58568,"logo_path":"/2qxPHPKa29w2MsaPKpYRfBnQcyq.png","name":"Les Films de Pierre","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1926,"logo_path":"/sORCydQs61kwWqRIIzPiBpgVVag.png","name":"Les Films du Fleuve","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Line","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":8}
