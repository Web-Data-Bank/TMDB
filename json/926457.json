Part of the larger Acropolis complex, and a Unesco world heritage site, it was built around 161-174AD by the Greek-Roman politician of the same name.  When an artist performs at this unique venue they are under no illusion that the monument is the main protagonist. Max Cooper managed with such mastery to reveal this ancient venue as a canvas so that that the architecture, beauty and history of the space become as much a part of the show as any of his music and visual collaborations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6duqMjhVBBSecy9XwLBWKcezi7Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max Cooper: Live at the Acropolis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
