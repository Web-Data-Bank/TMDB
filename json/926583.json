The film is narrated by Emmy-winning actor Jon Hamm and includes never-before-seen archival footage and in-depth interviews with those who knew and studied Williams, including his daughter Claudia Williams, author/journalist Ben Bradlee, Jr., veteran baseball writer Roger Angell and award-winning broadcasters Bob Costas and the late Dick Enberg. The program demonstrates the power of the heroic myth-making culture in which Williams flourished. Lesser-known topics explored in the film include Williams’ Mexican-American background, his experiences serving during World War II and the Korean War, and his deep rage over his mother’s virtual abandonment of him and his younger brother.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nick Davis Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"The Greatest Hitter Who Ever Lived\"","title":"Ted Williams: \"The Greatest Hitter Who Ever Lived\"","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
