To create Abbey Road’s new stereo, 5.1 surround, and Dolby Atmos mixes, Martin and Okell worked with an expert team of engineers and audio restoration specialists at Abbey Road Studios. This Super Deluxe Edition of Abbey Road features the new stereo album mix, sourced directly from the original eight-track session tapes. To produce the mix, Giles was guided by the album’s original stereo mix supervised by his father, George Martin.  Abbey Road’s Super Deluxe box set presents 40 tracks – including “The Long One” Trial Edit & Mix for the album’s epic Side 2 medley – on three CDs (stereo) and one Blu-ray disc (Dolby Atmos, 96kHz/24 bit high resolution stereo, and 96 kHz/24 bit DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ml0HVMkhO8paJswe872ffRmPG7H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beatles - Abbey Road","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
