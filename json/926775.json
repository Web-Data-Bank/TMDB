A fast drive, a road cuts through the man's silhouette. The gaze advances through a young forest, following a woman from above who soon reveals her calm, bright face from up close, alternating with that of the man. We advance slowly down a hallway, the woman's face in double exposure. Viewed in close-up, a row of lamps creates sections and perspectives. Hovering lights appear in succession. Steps and a pumping pulsation lead to a car ride, while the white section of the sky bleaches the woman's image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fLk8WyyBq9C7bTHr6kIsVBFMEbS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XVII/85 Projektionen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
