Processual Video is minimal with regards to an “image” but quite complex in terms of the interplay of language and image. In fact, the image as such functions more as a tracking device. On a black screen, a white line slowly rotates on its own axis, seemingly generating a spoken text that refers to itself. Depending on its position, the line gets narrower, then wider, finally dissipating horizontally into thin white strokes. While this is happening, Hill reads a text that triggers associations and wordplays with the precise position and detail of the continuously changing line.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Processual Video","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
