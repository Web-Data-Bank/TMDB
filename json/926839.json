The film-maker on separate video monitors, raps verbal explanation, poetry, reparative voice over and/or commentary, changing her hat for each change in language. This is an irreverent multi-lingual piece impishly concealing texts of renown (da Vinci, Tzara etc). A Kabuki howl cues brief live action, a shadow of an embrace and strangulation (evidently melodrama in early cinema); a bout of boxing; a mathematical (the ultimate language?) recitation delivered in the film light, from an imaginary cat walk by Ms Thew and Mr Pig, resplendent in evening dresses\" M.J.L London Film-makers' Coop cata., 1983","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blurt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
