During the exorcism, a voice-over relates the varied reactions of the bystanders. What is ‘exorcism’, and how do symbols, sounds and imagery relate to each other? In this highly experimental work, Chung compares the director’s montage with the process of exorcism, offering an alternative interpretation and reconstruction of the film’s structure and narrative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1993-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exorcism","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
