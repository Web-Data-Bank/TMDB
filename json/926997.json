A river of tears bursts its banks and washes the heroine away into a surreal world where symbols, references and personal experiences dance together. A baby learns to play the flute from a goose before becoming a girl and using the flute to drink up the river and swallow her teacher, the goose. A bone remains with which she draws herself a belly that gives birth to little creatures that suckle, swim, scream and explode and do all the other things that new-born babies do. In a pastel-coloured frenzy, the filmmaker traces the development from being an infant to an adult woman and artist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rC9K2RungZ3xC3k7WI6tjRahQnD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82153,"logo_path":"/mNEYX9oxFny6OOyb8083AKPbH8U.png","name":"Miyu Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Story for 2 Trumpets","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":4}
