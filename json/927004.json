As they roam the neighbourhood looking for somewhere to settle, they question their parents about faith, spirituality, roots and their experiences of migration. They decide to occupy an empty bank building in order to fill it with their memories, dreams and role play. A portrait of our time that oscillates between documentary, performance art and surrealism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rBoH3Glcx7syenMlF3VVB2hntZE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
