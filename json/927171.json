Appearing as a hole, a shadow, or a mirror reflection of his properly embodied friends and coworkers he pays a friendly visit to in each of the four scenes, he engages in a series of rebus-like exchanges in which he attempts to negotiate the nature of his existence, whereby he is present to others literally through his own visual absence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your Vacuum Sucks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
