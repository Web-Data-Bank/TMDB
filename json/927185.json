The crossbars are almost constantly in motion, sometimes as a single bar, sometimes as a group of several, and finally as a single bar. The moving crosses resemble film strips at times, but then they turn in a circle or shift and reveal the outside world: trees, bushes, or the sky. The images move faster and more frantically, superimposing on top of each other until they are interrupted at the end by individual freeze frames.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yOsol0HjCCtfpFQWr0nYqs98p3D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XVI/84 Fenster III","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
