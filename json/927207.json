School outcasts Rioka (Ishibashi Anna) and transfer student Yoshimura (Kirishima Rina) enter the world of a game run by an shady website on the invitation of their absent classmate Miki (Minami Yuki). Its objective is simple: a group of high school girls murder each other until one of them achieves seven kills.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tXvFC5RhkuYHDJqoaAeqFcW6Upv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167937,"logo_path":null,"name":"finefilms (JP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shojyo Senso","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
