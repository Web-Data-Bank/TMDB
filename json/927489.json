Antebellum Gallery existed from 2005~ 2017 in the heart of historic Hollywood on Las Palmas Avenue. Owner & curator Rick Castro presented fetish as art on a monthly basis for a group of like-minded enthusiasts who he lovingly referred to as “Antebellians.”  During Antebellum’s reign, Rick saw the times as a 21st century pre-war era, a time of cultural strife between social freedoms and the religious right culminating in a bad reality TV millionaire becoming dictator. The Antebellum era, like the Weimar era are historic short bursts of creative experimentation and freedoms existing under a looming dark cloud of things to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antebellum","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
