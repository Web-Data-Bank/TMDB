Grand Final day: Rugby League's finest tradition and most anticipated event. It is the culmination of a lifetime's devotion.  Being crowned Premiers is rightfully regarded as the pinnacle of the code; the ultimate reward for boasting the right blend of skill, speed and most of all, relentless determination. Nobody knows that better than the great Laurie Daley, which makes him the perfect host for this unique reflection of every competition decider since 1980.  From Steve Gearin's incredible try for Canterbury right through to Penrith's 2003 title, this compelling programme covers every grand final in between and the moments that mattered - unforgettable affairs like the legendary thrillers of 1989 and '97 to name just two - with recollections from the champions who etched their names so boldly in history with inspirational deeds under the most intense pressure that any footballer can face.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1DqHxMKGash4TJpNGdFqseEUjnP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70895,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual Entertainment Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2004-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's the day young boys dream about and can turn tough guys to tears.
