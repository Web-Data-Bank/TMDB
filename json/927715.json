From the first months of the occupation, he was active in the underground as a courier of the Underground State to Hungary. In 1940, he jumped from the second floor and escaped from the Gestapo prison in Krakow. After the war, he was one of the longest active ski jumping athletes in the world. Marusarz became the guest of honor at the 4-Hills-Tournament in the 1965-66 season. He stood on the famous Gross-Titlis-Schanze at the age of 53 - his jump in a suit and tie has made his legacy. Marusarz's spectacular jump in a suit during the Four Hills Tournament '66 became a pretext to tell his fate, as well as the story of his sister Helena - a talented skier, participant of the Resistance Movement, murdered by the Nazis in 1941.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zRhViLzOzTSp0Ak1unvP3xYzTPy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marusarz.
