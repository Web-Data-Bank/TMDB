These art schools are the most outstanding architectural achievement of the Cuban Revolution. But for many years, and up to recently, stood abandoned, consumed by the jungle, outside the western suburbs of Havana. For more about the story of the schools see revolutionofforms.com.  Solás' remarkable, taut, little film nevertheless captures the spirit of utopian optimism that characterized the early years of the Revolution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"1962-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Variaciones","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
