The two independently filmed parts are visible here as two film strips on the left and right of the screen, each with two images. The four image fields sway slightly against each other due to the inaccurate transport of the film in the camera, an effect reminiscent of moving train wagons on rails, and the different recording rhythms of the two film tracks combine to form a polyrhythmic montage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zRgHaR4Xit2EL4VBkUXUGDqrGrg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XIX/88 4 x 8","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
