Everyone is a suspect, and most of them had a motive.  Written and performed by Emily Head, directed by Guy Unsworth, and filmed live in one take, we meet each suspect to see how they react under interrogation, and see if the mystery can be solved.  The stage at the New Wolsey Theatre becomes a complex cage (designed by David Woodhead) in this Original Theatre Online premiere. Playing every chatacter, Head uses different accents and subtle physical changes of facial expression or mannerisms to define each character.  Paul is slowly unmasked as someone many would want to harm, and a twisted story unfolds through the different accounts we may or may not want to believe. It is clear something is drastically wrong in this psychological thriller.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2MWUdaRZHUh7WbVYstpH7tcR3y4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Original Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The System","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
