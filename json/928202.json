While buying a nice bottle of wine, Hortense meets Jacques, a fifty-something, grumpy local cellarman. Eager to see him again, she attends a chaotic wine tasting in Jacques’ shop - meeting his best friend who clumsily tries to seduce her, and his new apprentice who turns out to have a rare gift for tasting as well as an unfiltered honesty. As Hortense and Jacques grow closer and closer, their past begins to catch up to them.","popularity":3.925,"poster_path":"/s8zh9DbnkfGm2IaTZaciyKQd1iM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":694,"logo_path":"/5LEHONGkZBIoWvp1ygHOF8iyi1M.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11199,"logo_path":"/ursSXLOZaDxiZ84sEgfXbiFnYaa.png","name":"SCOPE Pictures","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":57294,"logo_path":"/aBPcCUBeSULcYMjxHAKR5286qyh.png","name":"Mandarin Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tasting","video":false,"vote_average":6.175,"vote_count":63}
