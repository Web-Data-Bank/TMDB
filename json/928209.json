Driven by a desire to cure Lisa of her own type 1 diabetes (T1D), the filmmakers got unprecedented access to a clinical trial – only the sixth ever stem cell trial in the world. What follows is an intimate decade-long journey with the patients and scientists who risk everything for everybody else. The Human Trial peels back the headlines to show the sweat, passion, and sacrifice behind every breakthrough cure. For the millions of patients suffering around the world, these breakthroughs can’t come fast enough.","popularity":1.216,"poster_path":"/aZQv63IoRjGPN4clGiSDVHiwX6s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Would you go first?","title":"The Human Trial","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
