Not much, apart from their skin color and the racism they experience. For the first time, the film \"Noirs en France\" gives the stage to black French people of all ages and from all backgrounds, known or unknown to the general public. Told by the writer Alain Mabanckou, this documentary retraces their stories, anchored in prejudices and stereotypes, but also filled with hope and pride. These blacks in France build a history in constant transformation.","popularity":1.012,"poster_path":"/xOb5Pqxuy4W94No8FfEixVNstr6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":88002,"logo_path":"/zV5SSl4WlW9Dh63M9dqhZiEPRCF.png","name":"Bangumi","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noirs en France","video":false,"vote_average":6.625,"vote_count":12}
