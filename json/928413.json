Humans hide in caves and pits. Dirt and darkness are their companions. All they hear is the wind howling across the frozen wilderness. Joe does not hear the wind, though. He only hears the deafening rattling noise of his generator which provides light and life. He does not need to worry about night monsters. He has ample time to look for the solution to the mystery of eternal darkness. INTEC has something to with it, and he will find out the rest as well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of Walnut Grove","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
