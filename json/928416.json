At the height of the Great White Hunter era, Edward turned his back on big game hunting and championed conservation instead. Inspired by his safari guide, Denys Finch-Hatton - played by Robert Redford in the Oscar winning film - he put down his rifle and picked up a movie camera, pioneering the photographic safaris we all know today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edward VIII: The Lion King","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
