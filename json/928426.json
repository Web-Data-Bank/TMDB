Harding presents Broncho Billy with a letter of introduction. The newcomer is taken into the rough western home and is told to make his headquarters there until he has finished with his painting. Harding sees in Broncho Billy's wife, an excellent subject for oils, and is given consent to paint her portrait. Harding takes a deep interest in the woman and not only teaches her how to read and write, but gives her a thorough knowledge of worldly things in general. Some time later, Harding receives a telegram demanding that he return to his home immediately, that his mother is critically ill. Broncho Billy's wife takes Harding to the railroad station in their buggy. Broncho gets wind of his wife driving away with Harding, and comes to the untimely conclusion that she is eloping with the artist. Harding is overtaken by Broncho Billy and a fierce struggle ensues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f9nc6rP7f1zdtXd7GunbKr0Va06.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broncho Billy's Mistake","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
