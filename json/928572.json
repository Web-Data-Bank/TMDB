This film is an expression of that process. Inspired by AngelikaÂ´s near death experience we immersed underwater in the sacred Mayan Cenotes to tell her story of growth from pain, anxiety, fear to surrender, coherence, harmony & flow. Just like the lotus seed grows from dark waters to become the most beautiful flower, we too have the ability to grow to our full potential. This film is an invitation to dive deep within, reconnect with the soul and experience the profound power of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/39RcouYXZW400MWb6CxmxsWE4H4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lotus","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
