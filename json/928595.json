The legends and magical stories depicted on the stones of the temple remains overlap with the reality of modern Cambodia. The lingering pain left by years of civil war, the gap between conditions in the cities and the countryside, and the thoughts of the boy who has lost sight of the future are conveyed at a leisurely rhythm with beautiful imagery that gently evokes emotion in the viewer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The People of Angkor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
