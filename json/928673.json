You'll see George Harms take a state record desert ram in California, and a world record CA Bighorn with a bow.  Bighorn 3 also follows Gary Hansen's #3 state record Idaho Bighorn hunt, and through Oregon for a CA Bighorn.  Mark Almgreen takes a great desert sheep with a muzzleloader, Ann Palmer shoots a great desert ram in Arizona, and we'll see a pistol hunt that completes all four methods of hunting.  With two additional Bighorn scenes, Bighorn III highlights nine outstanding hunts and closely focuses on field judging rams between 160 and 208 Boone and Crockett points.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cchtH60W34SiyKu4kvWUY4kMYn8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168191,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Lewton","origin_country":""},{"id":168190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Safari Video Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nine Great Sheep Hunts","title":"Bighorn Rams 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
