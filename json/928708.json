'Namjae', the father of 'Eun-tae', a high school student next door, also heard the rumors and contacted 'Joo-yeon' to be cast. As the parents of Se-hyeok and Eun-tae, who are neighbors, enter into a strange rivalry, Joo-yeon, who is in an embarrassing situation, eventually agrees with the two families to share the days of the week and guide Se-hyuk and Eun-tae. 3rd student Eun-tae has no interest in going to medical school and is only busy thinking about playing with her third-year-old girlfriend, and Se-hyeok starts to go for the beautiful tutor Joo-yeon rather than studying for the entrance exam.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jH3q1iTjBMwWV3bW619M290izA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young Mother 5","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
