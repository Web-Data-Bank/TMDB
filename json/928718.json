But things have never been the same since Isabel’s mother left. Once so well looked after, the house is now bare and neglected. Isabel and her husband are growing apart, and their children are increasingly worried about them. Maria’s sister’s disappearance has left her family in distress and forced her to engage in criminal activities with Adan, the son of a local policeman. Isabel decides to go on a dangerous quest, neglecting her own children, as well as her housekeeper’s warning that she does not understand how things work in Mexico’s poorer regions.","popularity":4.742,"poster_path":"/aLnJooXIKlAIxdElAQ37UtqLF8I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rei Cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":9980,"logo_path":"/9pLJAcyas8aUyVq0mwbv2EMQmgW.png","name":"Fondo para la Producción Cinematográfica de Calidad","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":81247,"logo_path":"/1UKEY2h0ouRnyRLX9yhBXtlZGxt.png","name":"Estudios Splendor Omnia","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":98240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cactus Film \u0026 Video","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robe of Gems","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
