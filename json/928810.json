Boisterously challenging Americaâ€™s dominant grasp on global cinema, their work pushed boundaries both technically and morally! From Gothic horror to the carnal violence of Gialli and the gut-munching terrors that followed in their wake, Italian horror cinema dominated the world market and Nightmare Industry will expose how these much-loved filmmakers made them, acquiring a legion of loyal fans as they went. This is a wild story of rivalries, heartbreak and compromises that transcend cinema and explores how a band of dedicated filmmakers changed the shape of horror forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ze75dXTUTkrnkQeoshdN549eW6w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135251,"logo_path":null,"name":"CreatorVC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"The Ultimate Retrospective on Italian Horror Cinema","title":"Nightmare Industry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
