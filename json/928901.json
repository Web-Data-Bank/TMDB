The suggestion he offers is this: They will spot a good car and when the chauffeur is near Hank will throw a fit and the sympathetic Lank will induce the chauffeur to take his stricken friend to the hospital. The scheme works perfectly. Hank approaches the car, is suddenly stricken, and doubles up spasmodically in an awful epileptic fit. Lank is the first on the scene and waves violently to the driver of the car. This latter proves sympathetic and offers to get Hank to the hospital with all possible speed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hank and Lank: Joyriding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
