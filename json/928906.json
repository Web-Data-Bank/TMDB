The film not only demonstrates how to make a cane fife, but also gets to the heart of both Turner and his fife and drum music as he's shown performing at an annual Fourth of July picnic. Quick cuts between dancing band members and the rhythmic movements of Turner's family going about their daily chores capture the mounting excitement and provide a rare, revealing glimpse of the work and play that characterize this traditional rural Mississippi society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eLWRm5uoEupsh1nTFd0L7JVp4sT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gravel Springs Fife and Drum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
