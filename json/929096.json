Made during quarantine, the work is about the yearning and the passing time that separates myself from natural space. The video starts on a single frame of a negative, lit from a lightbox. The negative is taken in the mountains in nature. At the time of recording, Quebec is still under lockdown and National and Provincial Parks are closed to the public. As an artist whose work is centered around nature, the environment, and the human relationship with nature, I have temporarily lost my muse. The act of layering squares of clear acetone over the negative, is the passing of time, until we lose touch with nature and natural space. The negative is barely visible under all the acetone that has been piled up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/duIqdfjtUzQxBV8mQVZ6fWYrnSR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disconnect","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
