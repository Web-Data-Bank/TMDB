An art film that just exists and breathes and whispers to your libido. Inspired by Magritteâ€™s \"The Treachery of Images\", I non-verbally argue that the one-sided representation of sex in media, whether through sensationalized click bait disguised as journalism or the male-dominated pornographic vision, strips sex to an act that nullifies its complexities and emotions. Created with absolutely no budget, this piece proves that there is a place for sex in art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kuDOdnxiNBnok1gVzzFg1VWnw40.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Treachery of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
