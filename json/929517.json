The locals tell stories of the strange optical illusion above the lake, the earliest sightings of which date back to the 18th century. According to some, it’s the devil himself; others claim it to be Pajari, a character so evil that even the devil didn’t want him. The present-day sightings become a part of the meteorite lake’s folklore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devils of Paasselkä","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
