Water contamination spreads throughout the village pipelines and one cybergoth finds herself laying on a hospital bed. The film is a visual poem narrated by a group of young inuit women, reflecting on ongoing suicide attempts and the separation from their families. The cybergoths remind us of a post-apocalypse future, that is to say, the apocalyptic qualities of the present; a fragile reality where national, communal, environmental, and mental stability is at risk.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3iJDyl6XbxP8pWL0ITkOdAlmCCO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GL","name":"Greenland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Kalaallisut","iso_639_1":"kl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Hole Legion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
