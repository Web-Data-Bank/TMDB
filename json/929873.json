The first four concerts were in festivals and the last eight in stadiums. The band held a tourname-competition among the fans and they personally chose the winning suggestion. The band did not play the \"New Song\" but the \"Other New Song\", which they had played on the previous tour (Escape from the Studio '06), was played at the Bilbao BBK Live Festival [1] The setlists of the tour were full of old songs. In Lisbon, Metallica performed \"...And Justice for All\" for the first time since October 1989.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dvp0Iub2YQteyxiT7VvldYsOxEh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live Concert","title":"Metallica: Sick Out Of Studio 2007 Oslo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
