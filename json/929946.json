On May 18, 2016, Allan Taylor performed in the \"Bürgersaal\" for the first time, the concert was quickly sold out and some of the guests were partly from far away - they came from Schleswig-Holstein, Berlin, Braunschweig, Frankfurt and even from Hungary and the Netherlands. A wonderful evening with the great songs of this artist, who has been traveling around the world for over half a century with his guitar, his stories and songs. The man, whose voice is so incomparably warm and deep, whose guitar playing is so puristic, yet so full and expressive, and whose wonderfully simple lyrics base always on deep thoughts and a touch of melancholy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oW74sq1dUhqvifer4nyve4k4MyF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stockfisch","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Allan Taylor - 50 Years on the Road","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
