His brain calculates financial schemes no worse than any computer, and his intuition is better than a lie detector \"reads\" each person. The price for such success is problems in the family. But who doesn't? One day, Viktor accidentally learns that the whole world, seemingly created by his hands, is someone’s long-thought-out plan, and he himself is not the master of life, but just a puppet, which is already pretty tired of the invisible puppeteer. Viktor starts the game ahead of the curve: to to live on and save his loved ones, he needs to find his \"programmer\" until he finally wiped him off the face of the Earth. Expensive villas with exquisite interiors, airports, abandoned bunkers, deceptively comfortable houses or high-tech business centers - everywhere there is a place to hide another clue for Victor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neuro","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
