On the twelfth day of Christmas, shipwrecked Viola washes up on the shores of Illyria, disguises herself as a man, is sent to court a countess and falls hard for a Duke. As she navigates the gender confusion in all her roles, she finds her true self and true love in the process. Featuring an original jazz-funk score by Shaina Taub, Twelfth Night is a soulful shake-up of a Shakespearean classic, perfect for the 12th night of Christmas or any day of the year.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vCdoeQHPBpd8JVhVv4LRKs7lD7g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143811,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Playhouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twelfth Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
