These reviled blocks were home to thousands of people. The architects of these buildings talk about how the blocks came about, while residents explain how they shaped their lives. The government set the architects a clear task, but they did not always submit without signs of frustration. A wonderful story about a past that, despite the depressing Bloki, is not reviled by everyone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fJzKE65wrV7c0jfG5LApER0x8d4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Dizajn","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloki","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
