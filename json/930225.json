By doing so, the object filmed frame by frame is exposed to the viewer's eyes for a longer period of time, creating an effect that is different from that of normal slow motion, where the object filmed at high speed is projected at a normal number of frames. This creates a strange sense of rhythm that strongly stimulates the viewer's sensibilities. 6 shows the overlapping of colors, and 7 shows the development of an image centered on silhouettes as the mind moves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3VQOnxJ1Z4UOVmaP5XmuzHtxzk1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bo Peep 5～7","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
