My family and I live in Ayase, and I work at a bookstore in Ikebukuro. Sometimes I open a store at a flea market with a friend. We sell tableware, which she likes, and accessories made from buttons, which I make, and they are quite popular. With the money we saved there, my friend went on a long-awaited trip abroad. My goal is to start living alone. Today is my day off, so I go out to check out an apartment. I stopped by a park and saw cats having a meeting. When I saw the old building, I suddenly wanted to see my grandmother, so I took the train...  The entire film is written in monologue and with a handheld 8mm camera, and features all the things \"I\" like: buttons, the dawn from my room, cats, the ocean, and my grandmother. There is no context, no meaning, no great sense of beauty, but they play a comfortable rhythm and a beautiful melody. This is a fictional essay whose natural gentleness reminds us of non-fiction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9lxf8fpgkhfzxgfUAkVkJ8BcZev.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SCENT OF THE SUN","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
