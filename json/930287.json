Long before the Kinkster became a celebrated mystery writer in New York City, and waaay long before he became a candidate for Governor of the Great State of Texas (thank you very much), there was Kinky the 'country' music singer and songwriter of the mid-1970's. He was a paragon, a veritable pioneer of political incorrectness set to music, and there was nobody quite like him on the Austin music scene (or, for that matter, on the planet). There he was on the Austin City Limits stage on November 11, 1975, in his finest rhinestone suit with fur-lined guitar strap, bounding through his entire catalogue of double-entendre ditties. The band never sounded better (nor looked, well, weirder). The audience loved every lyrically devilish twist. There was only one problem. They said it couldn't be aired. There's still some mystery about exactly who they were who made the decision to pull the show.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28897,"logo_path":null,"name":"New West Records","origin_country":""},{"id":17948,"logo_path":null,"name":"New West Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinky Friedman: Live from Austin, TX","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
