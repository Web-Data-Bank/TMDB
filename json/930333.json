But his dabbling catapulted him to global fame and there was no going back. Throughout his career, Depp has had fame and infamy in equal measure. His roles are often that of the isolated anti-hero: Edward Scissorhands, Donnie Brasco, Raoul Duke in Las Vegas Parano, and Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean. His poetic outsider characters reveal a critical view of American society.","popularity":1.535,"poster_path":"/uU8KgJcbyvPJJKIpK4lkD7R59we.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85979,"logo_path":"/A5tJ4wnByy98VlnqmyOmETdez3y.png","name":"TSVP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnny Depp: The Love of the Bizarre","video":false,"vote_average":6.25,"vote_count":4}
