Burns was a poetic genius, but full of contradictions. He was a lover of women, and an exploiter of them; a Republican firebrand, and a social-climbing government excise man; an advocate of freedom who almost became a Caribbean slave master. Alan examines the groundbreaking research that suggests that the poet suffered from bi-polar disorder, a condition that led him to have severe mood swings.","popularity":0.854,"poster_path":"/5EPKSqQJvtPulAPgABfT6dXTPtZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":145328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caledonia TV Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BBC Documentary Film","title":"Inside the Mind of Robert Burns","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
