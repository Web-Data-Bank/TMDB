The only thing they have in common is that they have all worked for the same boss - and, as they swap stories, discover that they have all screwed up for this same boss in the past. As they share their stories of errors on the job - seen through visual, stirring flashbacks - they begin to wonder why it was they were put together in the first place and what might be waiting for them at the end of their little road trip.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/aKe5EVKgeBsG8iwIIDHPM3MglMQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168519,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Slick Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":126757,"logo_path":null,"name":"My2Centences","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Dogs Lie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
