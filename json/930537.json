Although the film makes obviously wild pirouettes around this very interesting subject-dance instructors and their willing and able clientele and whatever relationships they have in between- it is in fact an intriguing drama about love, avarice, and betrayal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Z21tydFxMwBxeB8iKMur9fSPWE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8238,"logo_path":"/3f3SS3sep9V3Nf7RAxNd5UUEw1E.png","name":"Regal Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1996-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bayarang Puso","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
