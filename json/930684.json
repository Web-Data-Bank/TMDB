Reality shifts between layers as they seem to exist in both this world and possibly other worlds. Loosely based on Beauty and the Beast, Wish is a fairytale without a clear narrative, focusing instead on the invisible emotions that moments create. The film shows us an experience of alienation that can be at once both full of magic and deep sadness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x0dfXUY0RGtBHoMOsG8jDCg3dm1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
