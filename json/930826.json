In their \"Remarks on the Oberhausen 66 Film Festival,\" the GDR documentarians Gerhard Scheumann and Walter Heynowski take the competition selection to task: They see formal experiments as \"excesses on the big screen\" and instead of political themes, they discover a \"surge of perversity.\" After her own film \"Kommando 52\" was rejected by the festival, a criminal complaint by the GDR lawyer Friedrich-Karl Kaul against the mercenary and commander \"Kongo-Müller\" is the focus of a press conference. The refusal of a cinema owner to show the film was a \"hint from the neighbors\", the neighboring public order office, and therefore state censorship in the Federal Republic of Germany.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/88WKTXUEXHjKVLv3wHaI6tkNMXl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80379,"logo_path":null,"name":"VEB DEFA Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1966-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hint from a Neighbor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
