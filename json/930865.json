It successfully captures some of the raw emotions of northern Italy’s underground bombing universe, collecting rare footage, photos and interviews which include writers like Bread, Rae, MastroK, Spice, Dumbo. Great sound bites from these guys, who wanted to raise their voices upon the grey murmur of the big ciy. The film shows also some action, showcasing the street bombing missions in the subway of Milan. It’s an essential video for those who were there and who was not and anyone who don’t want to forget the historical memory of a movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8DFs7t6keM3xqrwam4zb9XZ22ES.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Italian graffiti street art in the 90's","title":"Nero Inferno","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
