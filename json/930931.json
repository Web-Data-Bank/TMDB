The headteacher suddenly announces that there will be a draft. The idea that a school is like a nation and that one must have the military power to protect one's own school could be a satire for the sake of satire, but as in the episode where the principal is a Chiba native, the term Chiba native is used as if it were a racial term. The film maintains the quality of the gags that generate laughter, as in the episode where the school principal uses the word \"Chiba-kenjin\" as if it were a racial slur, making it an excellent comedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tOiRlahHuClqO65HWyccuKd3jK0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"教訓 Ｉ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
