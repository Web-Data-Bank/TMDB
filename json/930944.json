Every day, Take Five, a guard protecting the deserted border district of Firebird, sits alone by his radio. It doesn't matter to him what's going on in the war front. His daily routine is to enjoy a game of radio poker with his unknown colleague on the other end of the radio. Marina, a young girl who vaguely believes in the happiness of the phantom city, comes to the border to board a refugee ship bound for Shanghai. However, her future is crushed by a ruthless gunshot... Fear and a sense of danger in a controlled society where dreams, hopes, and cravings for freedom lead to death. The hard-boiled narrative, which telegraphs the need to lament, is very stylish and wonderful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e9TNEsj906oyBRH9kZc17XJTxmn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"上海航路","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
