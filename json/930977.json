The next thing you know, your body shrinks and you're scurrying around like an ant on a stone slab. The next thing you know, your body shrinks and you're scurrying around like an ant on a pile of rocks. First, the movements of the characters are broken down into hundreds of still photographs, which are then colored, and then they are moved one by one in stop motion to create unrealistic actions.
