But Steven has a dangerous secret: He is going blind - and he's the bobsled driver. In the last interview conducted before he passed away at the age of 37, Steven tells his own story of rising through the ranks as a bobsled driver, hiding his blindness from his team as he becomes one of the best sled drivers in the world, his struggle with depression, and how, with the help of an experimental surgery, he overcomes his obstacles and captures gold before his untimely death. At a time when society is finally beginning to discuss the mental health of athletes, the film makes an invaluable contribution to this important conversation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/27qK6CGZctGugwTxE3DiV0ns1Si.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Brown, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holky: The Steven Holcomb Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
