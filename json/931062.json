It's a mix of awesome skate clips and partying. It opens with Tom Green trashing a mirrored closet door and they guys smack him around over it. I didn't know he still had a career... interesting. Aboard two boats the team go to an island, with a lot of beer, to celebrate the finish of their 2004 tour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Yhchgbwoo6J7wMAsGsNNvft0vu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northside Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skateboard Party","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
