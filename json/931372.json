Dropped into the life of this family, a helicopter is gradually enfolded into their daily rhythms, transformed into something utterly unexpected. In this land free of electric cables, cows find a shelter and children set up their private playground in it. Patient observations through the rusted “eyes” of this helicopter unfold a story of a remote place exposed to just one piece of civilization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ZrpQQvV9obI9LNw1zZsyA6Q41N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Their Helicopter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
