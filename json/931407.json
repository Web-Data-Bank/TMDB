After discovering unusual damage to native moss and lichen groups within his park, Anthony learns the environmental harm is linked to increased toxic gas emissions from a local coal-fired power station. Aware of the critical impact sulphur dioxide pollution has on human health, Anthony, with support from his father Laurence, is desperate to get the word of warning out by publishing his study in a popular Australian magazine. He consults a reluctant journalist at The Edge Magazine as to how he can get his expos√© out to the public in a meaningful way. However not everyone is so willing to make controversial accusations against the powerful and reputable energy company responsible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/smJdWHaFeYvHDHZI0ZqDYq5pMbF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Lichen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
