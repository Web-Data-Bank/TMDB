So in this work I first goth through a phase of sampling ; the collected pictures are then reworked by means of new media. I was looking for a paradoxal picture, regarding its temporal situation. Léger's film 20s grain is still visible, though interferring with frame effects which can be clues about numerical video tools. This can evoke bad encoding, \"low-fi\" pictures that we get used to by watching video hosting websites such as YouTube or DailyMotion. There we get some kind of uchronia, like time collapsing on itself. Some kind of spontaneous meeting of Léger's Modernism with psychedelism, YouTube and pirate TVs. The soundtrack is made of trains and stations recordings — trains being so dear to the Futurists — and popular songs from the 20s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
