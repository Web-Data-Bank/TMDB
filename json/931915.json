After hours of brushing up his dusty best clothes, Alkali Ike finally rigs himself out and, with a freshly washed rubber collar roped about his neck, chases into the ranch house where he finds the lovely Sophie seated at the organ, surrounded by the boys, who are industriously screeching their heads off in an endeavor to sing. Alkali Ike vainly attempts to elbow his way through and get a sight of the fair Sophie, but in vain, and is finally thrown out of the house by the boys. But his wooing is not in vain, and the next morning a motorcyclist arrives at the ranch and stops for a while. Alkali immediately sees possibilities in the machine, buys it outright, and invites Sophie to take a spin with him along the trail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alkali Ike's Motorcycle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
