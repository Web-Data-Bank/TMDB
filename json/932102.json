Walking along a Chinese village river, the women sing these songs while the film shows shots of the river. For most of the film, we don’t see either of the women’s faces as they reflect and narrate their past. The robbing of their youth in these camps causes them to dwell on their feeling of nostalgia and regret.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark River","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
