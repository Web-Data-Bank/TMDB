Juxtaposing static shots of stone buildings on \"sheer\" mountain sides with images of empty rooms, a ladder tilted against a wall, and a reflection of a car rounding a curve, Seaman suggests absence, unbalance, and the mystery of the everyday. A pair of hands clasped together, folding and unfolding, links the images together much as Seaman juxtaposes them for the viewer. Scissors on a table echo the \"cutting\" that is prevalent in Seaman's work, and provide another allusion to the title.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e0CQrR6h0eR3mgETWSrzWe8YcK0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
