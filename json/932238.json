This murder is considered the spark for the civil rights movement in the USA as well as a global, public-media confrontation with racism.\r Emmett’s story is not an exclusively Black or American story. Emmett had to die because he (allegedly) whistled after a White woman, while his killers were acquitted by an all-male, all-White jury, only to openly admit to the murder in an interview a short time later. “Cases like Emmett's are repeated in Germany and around the world. They affect us all – they are the stories of each and every one of us. Almost 70 years after Emmett Till’s murder, we live in a world that is still shaped by structural racism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ofBVySb3jZMXNGklsvIZpwau0Sn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Label Noir","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emmett – Tief in meinem Herzen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
