Il était une fois Gilles Bertin","overview":"Gilles Bertin founded in 1980 the punk band \"Camera Silens\" whose name is inspired by the isolation cells in which members of the Red Army Fraction were locked up. Years of music, heroin squats, anarchy and theft follow... He is one of the masterminds of the legendary Brinks robbery. It was April 26, 1988. Disguised as gendarmes, an unlikely team of robbers – punks, anarchists and drug addicts – rob the coffers of the Brinks. Balance sheet: 11.7 million francs (1.8 million euros) and not a shot. Most of the criminals were arrested and convicted, except Gilles Bertin who managed to escape. His escape will last nearly thirty years. No one imagines then that he has rebuilt his life a few hundred kilometers away, in a popular suburb of Barcelona.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zY0GOXyC4IaKkAVm338ucwZ569q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105852,"logo_path":"/8496jx3PA1EABhAO33sRy7zN49P.png","name":"Magnéto Presse","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PUNK!
