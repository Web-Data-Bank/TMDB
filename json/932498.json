Emotional, realistic and moving, his style regularly promises to win him the industry's most coveted awards. His publishing house is also grateful to the exceptional journalist, because the paper's numbers are sinking and are being cushioned by Bogenius' reportage, among other things. Everything sounds too good to be true - at least that's the opinion of freelance journalist Juan Romero, who takes on the inconsistencies and looks deeper behind Bogenius' research and reportage. It's a dangerous plan that faces numerous obstacles. But what he discovers turns out to be the biggest journalism scandal in Germany.","popularity":3.104,"poster_path":"/rzH9z7iqvSS4EzwYekTlIYucOuH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Thousand Lines","video":false,"vote_average":5.643,"vote_count":7}
