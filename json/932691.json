Mädchen","overview":"In Mödling, a small town near Vienna, girls between the ages of 18 and 20 have been disappearing without a trace at ever shorter intervals for the past 13 years. Residents are worried and accuse the police of incompetence. In this environment of fear and mistrust, the 19-year-old schoolgirl Jeanny meets the mysterious but charming tax consultant Johannes, which initially has something threatening about it. But Johannes sees more in Jeanny than just an innocent girl. And he gives Jeanny, who lost her father at a young age, support and recognition. He helps her to pass the Matura, he awakens her self-confidence and gives her the appreciation that she misses. An unusual love grows between the two, which is initially kept secret from everyone. As she is drawn deeper and deeper into the whirl of her feelings, the aggressive climate in the town continues to escalate. A militia is formed. Jeanny is becoming increasingly insecure. Can she really trust Johannes?","popularity":1.249,"poster_path":"/goWq9aywlh3C8dLxaroBBaA5eAx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16944,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rowboat Film- und Fernsehproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":13084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Graf Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":40711,"logo_path":"/6BdvNJBz95vJiD4sIVOPdKNZCi1.png","name":"Fernsehfonds Austria","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":39826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Land Niederösterreich","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2022-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeanny - The Fifth Girl","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":4}
