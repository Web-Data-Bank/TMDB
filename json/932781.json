Alkali Ike is robbed of his suspenders, his hat and coat, so that three of the men could look presentable. Sofie tries to entertain her three suitors, one in the parlor, another in the dining room, and the last in the kitchen. Alkali Ike calls to see the fair Sofie, and is shoved by suitor number one from the parlor into the dining room, his next trip from the dining room into the kitchen, and the last trip, the one that hurt the most, was from the kitchen through the window into some shrubbery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oSL5gGrAcjNWEvI5QZCtMYpoofA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alkali Ike's Misfortunes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
