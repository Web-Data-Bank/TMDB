As time passes, the cube begins to change: fluctuating extreme temperatures, random shifts of gravity, and strange writing appearing on the walls. His only communication is with a mystery woman who calls him on his satellite phone, claiming to be trapped in a similar space. As the clock ticks, the two of them must figure out who has them, why they were taken, and how to escape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vF1c2qgjSP4bKi0Aq7F56AsfmtB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The real test lies within.","title":"The Abandon","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
