Arnold frequently leaves the trail at this point and rides up the hill and makes visits with the quaint old woodcutter and his fond daughter. Algernon Fordham, scion of a wealthy New York family, comes into the west on a mining trip and makes arrangements to board at the Carroll's. His style soon attracts the unsophisticated country girl, and for the nonce she turns from the wholesome son of nature toward the man of the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tested by Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
