Drawing on research provided by the election integrity group True the Vote, “2000 Mules” offers two types of evidence: geotracking and video. The geotracking evidence, based on a database of 10 trillion cell phone pings, exposes an elaborate network of paid professional operatives called mules delivering fraudulent and illegal votes to mail-in dropboxes in the five key states where the election was decided. Video evidence, obtained from official surveillance cameras installed by the states themselves, confirms the geotracking evidence. The movie concludes by exploring numerous ways to prevent the fraud from happening again.","popularity":5.402,"poster_path":"/nTz0ZDc2PdHpn07O37Jmq2vaSPV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107196,"logo_path":null,"name":"D'Souza Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":177482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salem Media Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-20","revenue":1465513,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They thought we'd never find out.
