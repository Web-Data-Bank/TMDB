Alongside Stewie2k and Twistzz, the sky was the limit for our team until we struggled to keep up with the CS:GO competition over the next couple of years. We made roster changes to reach that same peak success and worked with incredible players like Grim and Fallen, but it wasn't enough until the team disbanded in 2021. This is the story of the meteoric rise and unfortunate fall of one of the most legendary North American CS:GO teams to ever do it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4m7kTcTmnUxfVf3hdOInSdlvwv3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1,100 Days: The Rise and Fall of Team Liquid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
