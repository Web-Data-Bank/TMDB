We take a journey back home, with filmmaker Ira McKinley, to the land of sugarcane, as he reconnects with his niece Bridget and nephew Alvin and explores their shared family history that spans seven generations. Told through stories that transcend space and time, Outta The Muck presents a community, and a family, that resists despair with love, remaining fiercely self-determined, while forging its own unique narrative of Black achievement.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/eWQBdMEsZ41YVbk52BZkKqh0ms0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Social Change in Mind Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/tpaJr0p9DUCm4xWrdR6YwuI6TjP.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":93092,"logo_path":"/6bzhNe066LzwT14dvYmtKNHUK8F.png","name":"Sundance Institute","origin_country":"US"},{"id":149046,"logo_path":"/kP4Spn3b51Z6YekLx5PfYMMB2CX.png","name":"Trailblazer Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Deep in the Soil Are the Roots of a People","title":"Outta the Muck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
