After her mother's burial, she is awakened in the middle of the night by distant screams. The immediate execution of all Haitians on Dominican soil has been ordered — the so-called “Cut” — and what seals a victim’s fate is whether or not they can pronounce \"perejil\" (parsley). Marie takes off to find Frank in the next town over, with nothing but the clothes on her back.","popularity":0.722,"poster_path":"/aBI88CSRGDZ6pgKFtepeGUA3mYV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123844,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tabula Rasa Films","origin_country":""},{"id":61255,"logo_path":"/4d8A1ZwelPfRpTQs20pB5AE7T3M.png","name":"Lantica Media","origin_country":"DO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Haitian; Haitian Creole","iso_639_1":"ht","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parsley","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":3}
