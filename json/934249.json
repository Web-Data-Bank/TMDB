David, protected by the belief that he’s just a kid with a camera, has constantly assumed risks. Even as a story of a sexual assault breaks, he’s busy covering up a near-lethal accident caught on film, intended to be entertainment. In the real world, these kinds of actions have life-changing consequences, but in the gold rush ecosystem of Social Media influence, the audience decides who succeeds, and who gets banished forever.","popularity":2.147,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4183,"logo_path":"/bPOaJehJ43bEq1sip5jE1G53IEE.png","name":"Diamond Docs","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1422,"logo_path":"/rIB6DuimR1qgLE14cBwpMABC2xx.png","name":"Killer Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Influence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
