Японец","overview":"The basis for the making of this film was a TV show to which many figures of the «youth culture» were invited. Boris Yukhananov turned this into a video project. This plot recurs twice in the film, forming a compositional counterbalance, at the beginning in the guise of a black-and-white television set, and at the end by means of the video action itself. Throughout the entire film we follow a Japanese man who is a kind of medium, a superhero, a bloated ghost of life after death, thus emphasizing the speculative spirit of the huge interest then being paid to «youth culture.» His adventures begin at a lecture podium that is replaced by an autopsy table in a morgue, and they gradually move on to an endless ritual dance with death in its various forms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1988-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mad Prince - The Japanese","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
