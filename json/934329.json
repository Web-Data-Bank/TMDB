As a mixed-race Black woman in America, Sarah, alongside the multicultural characters she's known for, explores her own personal relationship to one of the most relevant issues in our current cultural climate: the sex industry, and the surprisingly diverse range of people whose lives it touches. Through interviews and monologues, this film poses the question: how can we as a society have a healthy relationship to sex, power, race and our economy, without exploitation or stigma? The goal is not to prescribe solutions, but to highlight the human faces and voices at the center of this subject.","popularity":1.892,"poster_path":"/fXpn3iaFF06SYa6c1iiqQtS6Nd4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169207,"logo_path":"/iVn5RtRxReeRGXYSZkNZPRKIDYL.png","name":"Foment Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":170861,"logo_path":null,"name":"Conscious Contact Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":151143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Secret Sauce Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/tpaJr0p9DUCm4xWrdR6YwuI6TjP.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":66478,"logo_path":"/u7WmMkfo9MqsqfD5cuDAbd0u1qY.png","name":"Artemis Rising","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sell/Buy/Date","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
