In the middle of their 10-month regatta in Lisbon, they were experiencing a tipping point - to move on or stop. This story is about how to stop being afraid and start living your life, and not the life of your children, how to escape from a pandemic, lockdowns and restrictions. And how to re-learn to enjoy the little things, like water in the shower or the absence of mold on the ceiling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unbounded Family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
