It is one of the songs featured in Peter Polycarpou’s new musical revue, Falling Stars, which mines the vast American and British (and sometimes French) songbook of the 1920s and 1930s. Originally due to be staged at London’s Union Theatre in November, it has been filmed for streaming online to help us through the dark days of lockdown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b0knxHYwNpNiIc8hmr6KuCr8FnD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falling Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
