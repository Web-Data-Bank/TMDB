During Christmas Eve festivities in Barranquitas, Puerto Rico, the voice comes back after being dormant for a year. Not having Health Care, she desperately searches for the pills that will control her OCD without a prescription. Through her friend Jessica, who she met years ago in a mental institution, she meets David, the town’s pharmacist’s son, who agrees to sell her the pills. Trapped inside David’s apartment by a rainstorm, two strangers start uncovering truths about each other and start a healing process that doesn’t necessarily involve pills.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kIa77NcY5Hdkm5PVIsyA7rmGHsS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aberración Óptica","origin_country":""},{"id":188869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmes Casa","origin_country":"PR"},{"id":76184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rojo Chiringa","origin_country":"PR"},{"id":65091,"logo_path":"/7D7JB71JEiWigcRwkUawvukMocx.png","name":"Programa Ibermedia","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without Prescription","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
