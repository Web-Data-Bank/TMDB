The rays of the moon are shining upon the bed through the window. He is suddenly awakened by a bug of gigantic proportions crawling over him. This he attacks and destroys, but before again retiring he notices three more climbing up the wall. He lights the candle and applies the flame to each, causing them to explode with fine smoke effect. After this slaughter he retires in contentment and soon sleeps the sleep of the just. A very funny subject.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zMBVYJ0Ecl9DqA3P4haHaIBmfuo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georges Méliès","origin_country":""},{"id":7159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star-Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1899-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Midnight Episode","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
