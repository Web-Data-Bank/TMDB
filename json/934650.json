As with slowed down frames, the viewer sees how the impression of a moving image is created. But the sense of both movement and stillness, time and no-time, is even stronger. In this video I have reproduced this digitally. The original footage was shot in Cabot Plaza, Canary Wharf, and is a study in colour, texture and pattern, driven by the hurdy-gurdy music of RÃ©my Couvez.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plaza Continuum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
