Ronnie's biography is completely unique to the tired sex, drugs and rock and roll cliches. The film is about perseverance, dreams and the power to believe in yourself.","popularity":4.381,"poster_path":"/sBvyr2r5AdYxGXbk5Hw3CXUjrTl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dio: Dreamers Never Die","video":false,"vote_average":7.333,"vote_count":15}
