His hands on the skin of the conga peel back the legacy of colonialism while navigating the politics of culture and global migration. One of the world’s foremost exponents of Afro-Latin music, Santos, through his mixed Puerto Rican & Cape Verdean heritage, musical storytelling and legendary percussion classes, strives to unite and expand his kaleidoscopic audience.","popularity":0.646,"poster_path":"/uItIEsGPLOztpvzNHCIFU1Nfpno.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santos–Skin to Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
