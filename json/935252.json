Thrillingly romantic. Intensely sexy. Straddling the line between indie art film and hardcore, award-winning director Alter Sin once again expands upon the notion of adult filmmaking in Historias de Barcelona. Shot in beautifully-captured cinema verite close-up, you will see every bead of sweat... hear every deep kiss... and practically smell the cast's deep desires. Bastian Karim and Dann Grey star as a newly-minted couple navigating their way through recent break-ups, romance, open relationships, and trusting oneself - as well as those around you. Also featuring Ken Summers, Manuel Reyes, Rico Vega, and Sir Peter, these are the stories you will want - and need - to experience. These are the Historias de Barcelona.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ltW6ugwJNAnjHlOqPXBiHYfmw9I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141138,"logo_path":null,"name":"TLA Releasing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Historias de Barcelona","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
