The story is taken from a youth-oriented novel in which Dipu, a boy belonging to the educated class, is teased by the school bully but eventually forms a deep relationship with him. The rest is totally escapist in nature, including a scene in which the two youths manage to capture single-handedly an entire group of robbers.","popularity":2.187,"poster_path":"/4Gz1HkpZhwWpyuual7eytb5CBj9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"1996-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An adventure story for young boys.","title":"Dipu Number 2","video":false,"vote_average":9.4,"vote_count":10}
