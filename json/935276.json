Chased by the police and the press, they moved from squat to squat, with a clear message: don't make the city too expensive for the new generation of Amsterdammers. But living with such a large group and the flaws of the squat begin to take their toll. When the squatters collective falls apart halfway through the film, the filmmaker is left disillusioned and decides to confront the young squatters with her feelings of disappointment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/heWyaHvpgrGoc222jUMj2inN9f8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169340,"logo_path":null,"name":"Submarine Docs","origin_country":""},{"id":100462,"logo_path":"/24dhPKt8sDtfWfNs1rsVtskOwZZ.png","name":"BNNVARA","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Kinderen van Møkum, en ik","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
