The Underboss is a magnificent, multi-generational epic that centers around \"Mighty Joe,\" a beautiful professional fighter in the mob's pocket who, after beating up a couple of reporters, gets thrown in the slammer. Mighty Joe's incarceration ignites a labyrinthine series of events that not only exposes the dark underpinnings of the mob's way of life but also threatens the very existence of his mentor, the powerful Underboss, played with razor-sharp perfection by Barresi himself. It's a cinematic mosaic of mystery, mayhem, mesmerizing style, and unparalleled vision that really delivers a knock-out punch! The Underboss shocks and surprises right up to the last unforgettable frame. After all, in Mob-land, the only thing sweeter than sex is revenge!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9fak5vTpBPB4zJH1WPU8l052CZH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9356,"logo_path":"/muamv4HhYM6tFDOCYx3EvBKVJof.png","name":"U.S. Male","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Underboss","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
