Moreover, CLC Purbalingga has been consistently and independently holding the Purbalingga Film Festival, presenting a \"Celebration\" of Film Festival amidst society, holding the open-air cinema in many villages in Banyumas Raya. Purbalingga is so far away from the luxurious, cutting-edge theaters and the frenetic film industry of the Capital; yet, there is where the zest to present the best for Indonesian cinema keeps alive and propagating. This is a documentary about their passion, militancy, and simplicity - the Ballads of Cinema Lovers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c46yXWloxhcsCAI6Zw9scbocye4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballads of Cinema Lovers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
