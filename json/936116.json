The Pobertanian Bean Wars:  When Bobbin receives a pair of Pobertainan Flamenco Beans in the mail, the gang just can't wait to see them dance. But these beans are in no mood to make merry. In fact, they are furious with each other! Join the Threads pals as they find out the cause of the commotion, and try to help patch up the predicament. Can the bean brothers bury their beefs and be buddies again? Bobbin and company learn about the Boxed Bean Business and also, just how important it is to forgive one another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lBAJ3u5tD3sxPkx7OQzh2SdGbei.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Word Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Threads: Things That Go Puff in the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
