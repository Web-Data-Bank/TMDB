The narration centers on a young woman's struggle to find a relation between her body and her self as mediated by language. The text is a poetry of formal relations that carries personal and historical implications, including the desires of the woman paradoxically voiced by a male narrator. The title suggests the vivid virtuality of dreaming; scenes repeatedly refer to both reading and sleeping.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x02xOSWdoiXNeD4U8HdEpcevtF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of the Body Travel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
