This is not about covering a blank surface with forms and colors since they already exist on the black film. Whilst ALL OVER is a film made without \"instrumentation\" (like a camera), it also differs from direct films in that the film remains untouched by any tool (not even the hand). As in dripping, materials and color are spontaneously laid down on the film in semi-controlled gestures, which create a shower of colored dots. The soundtrack functions according to the same principle: the sound, in all its expressions, is formed using one single formal element.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cyugeLKwFc3gRLz9jcJKhaLg8n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All over","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
