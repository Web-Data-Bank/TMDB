Each loop is exposed in one moment with 59 pinhole \"lenses\" to create as many distinct images that, when presented in series, create a panning of the landscape in various directions. The work was exposed on outdated black & white 35mm print stock acquired from Archives Canada discards, and processed by hand in Caffenol chemistry, a less environmentally impactful developer made with coffee, vitamin C and washing soda.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j0kqSqIOZHCnsaDjOXwUWy3Ide6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pinhole Park","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
