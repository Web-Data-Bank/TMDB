From tiny clubs in the mid-nineteen eighties to a restored historical church in upstate New York, the CLGM has endured for thirty years. This is Mike Osterhout's church. His approach is raw, provocative and gleefully absurd. He's embraced his obscurity as a badge of honor. In his heart, however, he thrives on human connections. His devotion to his community has allowed him to create a home for his congregation and a safe place to transgress in the Catskills.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lkGy2uUOAPhCYYLOFwulevazYGU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mike Osterhout & the Church of the Little Green Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
