In this film, Cuthand reflects on the ways that the bear cub spirit contained within the since-buried bundle has continued to protect her family from the trauma and diseases brought on by colonization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rabDgHcFYxg6jXoU2uBIgNTW4J5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Medicine Bundle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
