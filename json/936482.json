It is a result of a series of loaded questions we ask ourselves, and now wish to impose on viewers. Mr. X is the serialized signifier that sparks problematic readings and profits in rap music, “political art,” and fashionable sportswear. Is X the sign of a meaningful difference, or just another hip style thang? Appropriating an MTV-like format to critique and question the capitalist commodification of Malcolm X’s subversive politics, X-PRZ sets computer-manipulated imagery of Malcolm X against advertising logos, archival footage, TV imagery, and a propulsive soundtrack of rock music by R.E.M. and Nine Inch Nails. – Tony Cokes","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/evgP9byfjCVWG6PPkDyihwtWSKA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Sell Out","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
