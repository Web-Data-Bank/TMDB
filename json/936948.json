Images and sounds and the way they are related to each other mark clear, real, sensory experiences and their traces. Sometimes they appear as minimalist riddles. Meaning can only be derived by approaching them in an open and circumspect manner.  This very personal work by Michael Pilz, compiled from footage he shot between 1994 and now, gives the viewer a beautiful picture of the way in which he creates his filmic world. The different recordings were originally not connected to each other. Through the re-editing of both the images and the sound, Pilz creates a new filmic reality in which the concept of time comes to a halt or disappears entirely. Art is not about what, but how, according to Michael Pilz.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9wklZrgVCp2s8jZgLddoc8zdbeK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Windows, Dogs And Horses","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1}
