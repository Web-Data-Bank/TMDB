His first paintings had a light and everyday life character, but the deafness he suffered from 1792 and the impression caused by the War of Independence profoundly marked his life and his work. In the paintings of his mature years, expressive force prevails over formal beauty and his audacity heralds the freedom that would characterize modern art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/doZwczdZ8qdu2YXmXykux2Oj6dC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cromwell Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GOYA Painting Geniuses","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
