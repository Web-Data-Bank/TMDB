A wrench is thrown in the Craigs' plan when author Stephen Ware comes to the little hamlet in search of a quiet place to work. Meg immediately develops a crush on him and Ware's stay proves to be anything but quiet when there's a robbery and he is assumed to be the guilty party.

When they return, Donald and Duncan are infuriated to find Ware in their home, and they insist that he marry Meg to save her reputation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pr5H6hM9EXRdoMOiBwh1taqwkWG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realart Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1922-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Homespun Vamp","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
