When it is the older womanâ€™s turn to play, she, too, cannot finish the piece she is playing, which was written by her daughter in the months prior to her death. As both women struggle to articulate their feelings of loss and grief, they realise that the music gives them a means of holding on to, and living with, their pasts. 'Resonance' is a film about memory and emotion - and about the power of music to articulate and give life to the human spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5qcfz3tACbff276hYBm4V7qOjpP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resonance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
