The film shows John Baldessari in all aspects of his work: as an artist in his studio, with the technicians he collaborates with, as a teacher interacting with his students, as a passionate observer of the contemporary scene and visiting the Biennale in Venice as well as the Basel Art Fair.  This film provides us with insights into the work of a radically modern-thinking artist and sharpens our perception of the often inaccessible world of contemporary art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79690,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pars Media","origin_country":""},{"id":161584,"logo_path":"/sPdlHrkSpsIKkm5burGL5QB7PbX.png","name":"ZDF/3Sat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Not That: The Artist John Baldessari","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
