He wishes to marry Julie, the daughter of Francois Ledru, a French trapper. Julie is afraid of McLeod and rather than become his wife she runs away. Ledru is terrified when he discovers her absence as he knows McLeod will make him suffer for it, in which fear he is fully justified, as he is beaten and then shot by McLeod. Meantime, Julie, in her wanderings, runs into Father Lezare, who is journeying toward the trading station, and also David Brandt, a hunter. She appeals to them for help and upon David's assertion that he will do anything to help her, she begs him to marry her. After some hesitation on the part of both David and the priest, this is done.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Panther","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
