Two young Estonian men, Andrey and Reimo, have been killed several times in these fights. Each time they resurrect, because those are the rules of the game they play along with their comrades in the Frontlinemilitary club. Enthusiasts of different nationalities join such clubs because of their appreciation for the memory of World War II as well as their love of reconstructing the 'soldiers' lifestyle of the era-in detail. SS-Untersturmführer Reimo leads the 20th division of the Waffen SS, Sergeant Andrey marches in advance of the Red Army's 11th Rifle Division. The fight for history goes on, with arms in young men's hands.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7k5SjIkMwuwrpYH6pOsr7qE0PfQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2016-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Play War!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
