The walking hero in the film finds a beret – the aura of an artist. His journey ends at the Museum of the Revolution of the time, which now houses the National Gallery of Art (2009). During the Soviet period, art was often understood as one of the ways to spend free time. The film is dedicated to the memory of Bronius Maigis’s political protest, carried out on the 15th of June, 1985, at the Leningrad State Hermitage Museum.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freetime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
