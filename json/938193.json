However, he does not know who she is. One day, a nuclear missile is accidentally launched at Japan. The children play innocently as if they have no idea of the fate that will happen in a few hours. Then the boy meets the girl again... The film tackles the heavy theme of nuclear fear, but instead of shouting hysterically against nuclear weapons as in previous works, it speaks poetically and dreamily. It is a requiem for children who have never known war to continue to be a generation that has never known war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eszk0jrHtZ7AxcUw1OjPtLjH0fw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169831,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daisan Eiga-kai","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Play Again Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
