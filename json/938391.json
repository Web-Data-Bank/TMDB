Curtis, who is not as talented as he believes himself to be, fails at his job but is saved by his wife Anita, a former actress, who has forsaken her career for marriage. Anita and her old manager, Bruce Winthrope, fashion the play to suit Viola, and Vanity becomes a huge success. The play's triumph enlarges Curtis's ego even further, and he deserts Anita for Viola.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/98S3IK6sIRu65HA5MOD7r6FeKHG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idolators","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
