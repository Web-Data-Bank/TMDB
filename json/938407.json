Shot in the style of a documentary, Reserved explores the absurdity of official routine and the everyday working of social privilege and hierarchy. The title refers to the signs that are often placed on chairs in the front rows of formal events. However, Abidi mainly focuses on those excluded from these 'reserved' spaces.  Reserved portrays the experience of waiting, and the boredom and sense of uselessness that it causes. While events like these take place in cities across the world, Abidi draws upon her own memories of growing up in Karachi, Pakistan. She recalls continually having to wait for a mayor, governor or some other dignitary to arrive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tbZzlGuhs4FnZPV2jFTe8H1ggfa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reserved","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
