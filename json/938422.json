Lawyers uncover the harsh reality of young children navigating the legal system. Advocacy organizations try to keep children safe and away from predators. An eclectic array of interviews from foster care alumni explore their connections (or lack thereof) with social workers, the fragile bond with each foster home, how trust can fall apart, and how those unable to adapt spent time in group homes. The film concludes with alumni success stories, working to remove the stigma of foster care.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pMyBDB5T7HI0mO1CWYK1OUrsBgt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vyne Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where's Foster?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
