This story isn't about how they cry every night reminiscing about their past either. This story isn't even about how ten old men decided to rob a bank with zero know-how. It isn't even about Antoine's recipes and Ali's songs, though they will be in our story. Get ready to learn the most important thing - this story is about Virginia. In the Lebanese mountains, not far from Beirut, in a nondescript building, ten homeless lonely but not unhappy old men live. You can't say that they are totally happy, but they try to be, to be happy in their own way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 and Virginia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
