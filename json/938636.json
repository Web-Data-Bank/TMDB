She refused to eat for her hero and for her he bore the marks of battle, an eye made black by a cruel parent's fist. Tired of such an unsympathetic world, they sought the wilderness, where, had it not been for Indian Charlie, these two \"babes in the wood\" would have ended their dream in a manner quite too disagreeable to think of.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164827,"logo_path":null,"name":"Biograph Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
