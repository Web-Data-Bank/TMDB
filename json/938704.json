Wally, the younger, is a wood-cutter, while Phil is a cripple. The brothers receive word from a city physician that Phil can recover from his infirmity only by means of an operation which will cost $800. The amount, however, is far larger than they ever expect to own at one time. In the meantime, Nan Leslie, of the U.S. Revenue Service, is detailed to go into the mountain districts of Kentucky and get evidence against a gang of moonshiners.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5LvPrQCY7QZKMRSqNGcgJ8tm7M2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21844,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rex Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heart of the Hills","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
