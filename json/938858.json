This is the method used by an amateur criminal organization that fractures the limbs of its willing victims before staging fake accidents and raking in the insurance payouts. Vincenzo recruits the individuals from among the down-and-outs that haunt the city streets, where Luisa is a habitué, since she gets her crack there. Vincenzo’s problems suddenly get worse, though, after a series of mistakes shut him out of the gang, and Luisa is now his only chance: he convinces her to have her bones broken.","popularity":0.816,"poster_path":"/kKO1f92mY2ckADAhlCaanvqNIQG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30817,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tramp LTD","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":77395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regione Siciliana","origin_country":""},{"id":77396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sicilia Film Commission","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":77393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sensi Contemporanei Cinema e Audiovisivo","origin_country":""},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bone Breakers","video":false,"vote_average":6.625,"vote_count":4}
