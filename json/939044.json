In Charles’ words, the film “shows something of the special and rare situations that existed when these two cultures came together…one very sophisticated, one with a highly developed technology.” The soundtrack juxtaposes the visuals, with music from the album “Banjo Kings,” an early-American fife-and-drum recording from the Smithsonian Institution archives, and traditional Japanese music from tapes provided by the Japanese embassy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2lCT0sOLFmUfnAaenwCsqVOzoIt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Ships","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
