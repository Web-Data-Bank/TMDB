Both Shervin and Samar offer a glimpse into what life is like for trans youth, who despite loving and supportive parents are forced to live covert lives, shy away from their neighbours and even consider emigration, in order to be who they truly are. One of the many heartrending scenes in this documentary features one of the boys, fully clothed on the beach and yearning to go swimming, while the other shouts at his parents, asking whether his father is also forced to wear a headscarf. This is Not Me is a detailed depiction of the legal and social labyrinth that promises a slim aperture of freedom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/viysK5RkFxXq7hejb2LOSFULhPg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2022-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Not Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
