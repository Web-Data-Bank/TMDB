The swinging 60s? Vivienne Westwood pioneering punk fashion? One notable establishment in this enclave of history that’s often forgotten about is Gateways, London’s longest-surviving lesbian club. Alongside a host of its patrons over the years, Sandi Toksvig highlights the legacy of the club from its original owner, who won it in a poker game, to its blossoming into a hotspot and safe space for lesbian life. From its signature green door to the risqué dance move that gives this film its name, Gateways was a crucial part of London’s queer history. In this charming and informative film, it’s celebrated in all its glory.","popularity":0.751,"poster_path":"/7Ce3hQgleHgeSjAq2E23NT4vEKL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165253,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jackdaw","origin_country":""},{"id":73407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anubis Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gateways Grind","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
