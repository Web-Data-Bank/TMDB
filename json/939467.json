From the realities of a crumbling economy, to the ravages of the opioid epidemic, to the irreparable environmental damage and its tragic impact on human health – the film is a cautionary tale of unfettered corporate power, and an elegy to a vanishing Appalachia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uRLPwWCQBwHXzRpKEnUIZMDtH70.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devil Put the Coal in the Ground","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
