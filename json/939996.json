It is the story of the careful attention that is paid to small, seemingly insignificant rock fragments and minute bits of the prehistoric past. Day by day, and year by year, information is collected, analyzed, and evaluated, until slowly the big picture comes into focus. To create a compelling documentary we have developed a locally based storyline that has regional significance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Point in Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
