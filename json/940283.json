Choi Kyung Soo, who hails from Sokcho and moves to Seoul for college. Perhaps due to the pain he experienced during his high school days, Choi Kyung Soo has a hard time opening his heart to others.  The confident and cool Lee Hyun Jung [A] is admired by the other students at school and is more mature than most of her peers. When she and Choi Kyung Soo meet in a stargazing club, they develop feelings for each other that they are unable to express.  The hard-working and intelligent Lee Hyun Jung [B] was admitted to college at the top of her class and has little in common with Lee Hyun Jung [A] apart from their name and major. Lee Hyun Jung [B] finds herself drawn to the reserved Choi Kyung Soo, who always seems to keep a distance between himself and the other students at school, and she tries to bring him into her group of friends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kvLjPTS0vtl5zARLb49SFKuCZAc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92012,"logo_path":"/lGELj7l0lQpnbC4uYm3nX4jS4d1.png","name":"The LAMP","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Starlight Falls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
