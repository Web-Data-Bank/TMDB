Is the grass really always greener on the other side? And what is home, after all - is it four walls and a roof above your head, or a view from your window, a bench in the park, the smell of the city in the spring? Is it a place of strength which gives you a feeling of security and comfort, or is it a space that allows you to realise your creative ambition, or is it a person who accepts you as you are? Together with the protagonists, we move there and back again, between home and not-home, between the past and the present, between Ukraine and not-Ukraine, immersing ourselves in their worldviews and testing our own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yuA0H6wVU5x4Edy6P9HAX24GrIi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2017-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meanwhile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
