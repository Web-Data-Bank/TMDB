A journey to the roots of the passion takes us to the backwoods of rural Finland. On our way, we encounter eccentric fellows, who have devoted their lives to nature. They are haunted by the call of the wild, the idea of being part of nature, or the sensation of companionship with wild animals. On one hand, the nature must be protected from the human influence. On the other hand one has a lust to get where no one has gone before. In order to get in touch with nature, one relies on technologies that separate his body from it. We are guided by the enthusiasts’ passions to the nature of their experiences. What do they tell of our modern life?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v6PiNIVpkBAWAVSQ8Qe0320zxjQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nature of My Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
