Madonna was born in Bay City, Michigan on August 16, 1958, and her connection to the town has been a hot button issue there since her rise to stardom. In 1987 local media turned public opinion against her after comments she made about Bay City on national TV. By 2008 though, attitudes had shifted as the town fell on hard times and there was renewed interest in using Madonna’s fame for municipal gain. But with a shrinking population and cash strapped government, is it too late to do anything about it?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r8tmfX9114VhXRaomJ8T4k4jvve.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smelly Little Town","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
