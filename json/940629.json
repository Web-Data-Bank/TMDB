Shot in an off-the-cuff manner, moved by the city night and the image of himself and his partner, Djuly Gava, in the auto glass, this film contains a pilgrimage of wonderment in a deceptively simple moment. (Screened 2/17/22 at MoMA as part of Millennium Film Workshop: “Nighttime” NYC event).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"N-York – a caminho do Anthology","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
