I want to dedicate this film to my best friend Briana Joyce. She first told me that this was a way she goes through life… I wanted to do this for her so she can look at it, make it her past, and grow. We all have intrusive thoughts in our lives, and these are hers.  This is my first time participating in this festival and my first time writing, directing, filming, and editing a short film(seriously. i’ve done ones where it was a joke in high school lol) It isn’t perfect but so aren’t I. I am so proud of all the hard work put into it. It’s my baby :))  Thank you for watching.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intrusive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
