Her ordinary daily life is captured with an ultra-long camera that is almost always left unmoved. Episodes with her friends from her high school days are cut back and forth in black and white, and the past and present are told in an unhurried manner. However, the past soon becomes a duplicate of the present, and every day turns into a daringly extraordinary one. Inspired by a short film of the same title by Fumiko Takano.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Ak7IvzDMZgsQy861uJDEOcF59Kj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back Head","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
