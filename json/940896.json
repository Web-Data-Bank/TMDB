On a lightly rainy spring day, the filmmaker arrives at the beach with her camera, and asks two friends to be her subjects, lying on their stomachs on the rain-soaked ground, she slowly zooms in on them as they walk down the street from a low angle. The cut brings back the feeling of the cold ground, familiar to anyone who has ever shot 8mm, and before you know it you find yourself looking through the viewfinder with the artist. A visual diary was casually written with awkward and confident sketches of the landscape and shy narration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2oCsRm9fB2msnVpiq59F6nyulcD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bye-Bye, Mail","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
