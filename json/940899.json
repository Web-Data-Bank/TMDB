When her parents don't come home from work, they sit in the kitchen and have an idle conversation. The man asks her to eat a clam. A woman mumbles, \"I have sand all over me\", and scours the kitchen floor like a mollusk. The man wipes the woman's neck when she asks him to wipe off the sand. The camera lingers on the faces of the two men and the rummaging in the sink as they mutter idle conversations about sand. This is a dense cinematic space, where the hot, rough texture of the sand makes your whole body tingle. The coquettishness of the woman's hair, her neck, her lips, her tongue, her gestures and her voice, captured by the gazing camera, is an intense eroticism. This is a work of high perfection in which the artist's unique world of sensuality is penetrated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7oaMmQ1OMkLS66riwRm9e8TNNuy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Strange Affair","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
