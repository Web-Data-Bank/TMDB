Releasing one film for every day of the year through his website, Mekas drew upon a vast archive of film and video footage recorded over the past decades, as well as new material from his everyday life. The “365” project painted an intimate portrait of Mekas’ life, friends and travels, in the poignant diaristic style which he has come to embody. The project attracted a strong international following and prompted many filmmakers around the world to begin their own “365” film and video projects. March 16, 2007: ”I take Helsinki-Tampere train. Not much snow. At the opening of Tampere Film Festival.” – Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"365 Day Project March 16","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
