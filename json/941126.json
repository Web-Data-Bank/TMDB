Although deeply revered amongst fans of folk music and the 'singer-songwriter' genre, she has never received the universal acclaim so long overdue and so often heaped on those of a far lesser talent. This documentary attempts to redress this imbalance and reveal why she remains such an inspiration to so many. The film includes musical performances by Sandy Denny, reviewed and re-assessed by a team of esteemed experts, obscure footage and rarely seen photographs of Sandy, brand new and exclusive interviews with Dave Swarbrick, Martin Carthy, Dave Mattacks, Gerry Conway and John Renbourn, Fairport Convention biographer and all-round Sandy Denny expert Patrick Humphries, folk journalist Colin Irwin and Uncut magazine's contributing editor, Nigel Williamson.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chrome Dreams Media","origin_country":""},{"id":117830,"logo_path":null,"name":"MVD Music Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sandy Denny: Under Review","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
