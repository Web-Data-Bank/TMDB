In his hometown in Kansai, he meets a high school girl. The film tells the story of the moratorium of youth through the connection of seemingly unrelated episodes between the young man and the girl. A truck driving through the city, a teacher from high school, an exchange with the girl. The film is full of transparency, with a conscious interplay between black and white and colour, as if it were a mental picture of the young man himself. In the last scene, the girl turns the 8mm camera on herself, and her face, enveloped in light, is refreshing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oT33ZlLKGebndHLZl5CWRlvWoCs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Drifting Man and A Wandering Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
