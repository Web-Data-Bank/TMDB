There they live in a mousy apartment block, surrounded by mousy walls and looking up at a mousy sky. The expression on the back of the Kappa's face is very similar to that of a middle-aged businessman. Eventually, the final war comes to the lives of the peaceful, smiling Kappa. Mass slaughter, spurts of purple blood, and mountains of corpses. But whether this is in the past or the future is never mentioned. A Kappa desperately pedals his bicycle, but where will he end up? A unique animation that captures war as an idea and the Japanese people as an idea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/okx4d7lfmklOHGFrEFAx5Wp7DwT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kappas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
