He summons up his courage and stands in front of the automatic door, trying to be a perfect urbanite. The cynical dialogue has a unique rhythm and fires like a machine gun. The screen, which never stops changing, merges and engages the audience, shouting out what a metropolis is and what humanity is all about. Matsuo embraces his Dutch wife and swims out to sea alone, only the cold waves gently enveloping him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hgzyzYVDtyVKtoJeWyV56Lwog3r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Convenience Papa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
