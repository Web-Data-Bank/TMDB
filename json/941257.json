With an up-tempo rhythm, something strange happened in the kitchen of the Yabe family. It was the unthinkable: the production of 300 dumplings. My mother wrapped up a heap of ingredients in a tub-like bowl with unbelievable speed, and using two frying pans, she baked the dumplings, one after the other, without mercy. In three minutes, the film is as full of laughter and family love as the Yabe family's dumplings.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/gpcMO8n3FZJlsSpit9zGJlI1dtK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Mother Makes Dumplings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
