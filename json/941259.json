She says it's to meet someone she likes. Koichi is reluctant to go, but he has no choice but to borrow a car from his friend. This is how their journey begins. A love story in an off-the-map town, with a light touch on the relationships between men and women of the time, such as Assi-kun and Keep-kun. With the addition of stylish props such as Koichi's room, his friend's car, and the breakwater in Kujira-cho, a bit of whimsical dialogue, and background music that shows a thorough attention to music selection, the film is a road movie with an experiential beat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l4OkCr2qk5eKr9k00yMljOhRZki.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Circle Ronin-gai","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dusky Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
