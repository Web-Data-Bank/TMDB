One day in winter, he meets a mysterious white woman and lets her rest in his room. He becomes intensely curious about her identity, but she simply tells him her name is \"Nana\", and her silence and wandering continue. Who is she?  A unique drama that uses the emptiness and loneliness that all of us face today as a motif to vividly cut through the fundamental problems of human existence. The director's ability to create tense and suspenseful images is so imposing in scale that it is easy to forget the 8mm frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jr0NO3pY6Iwdbx9Oz2zJMxT0B7j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NANA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
