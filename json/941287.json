She immediately takes off the underwear she was wearing and washes it. You stink. She sniffs her washed panties, curious about what the stranger has just said to her. At the cinema where she works part-time, a colleague, a projectionist, stalks her, and Fumie's heart slowly begins to race.  The film is a more eloquent and naked account of women's lives and their true feelings about menstruation. The film is a raw but lyrical portrayal of body odour, vomiting and other things that everyone tries to hide, as well as the fragile friendship between women, which leaves a strange aftertaste after watching.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1Q8QFF2K8v0KdX7Gaa97SjpaciT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret Purple","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
