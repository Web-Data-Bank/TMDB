All images are carefully composited according to the divine proportions. We see images poetically and metaphorically representing the beginning of mathematical innovations to the projected end of the world, the big crunch. Our observations and our learning shape the universe into being, time is a creation of our minds, laws are generated by our thoughts and conclusions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w4ZYjRbbQjguFFNm8lGCeXZ52nl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2012-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Crunch","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
