This is one of those men who have to uproot themselves and leave their families to be able to work. How many of them have the terrible feeling that they are wasting their life to earn it? Exemplary suppliers, anonymous workers, nomadic builders, they move from factory to dam, from one site to the next and form a society apart. Every day, these men have to rise to the occasion. Each evening, they have to tame the loneliness a little more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n8dFmgqxbTT7zsxm0jleTfeQkJo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mon père","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
