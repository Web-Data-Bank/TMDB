Before the animal's desire for battle is satisfied, the hobo's clothes are in tatters. A hospital attendant throws some old clothes in the field with the intention of burning them. He has forgotten matches and returns to get some. While the man is gone, Fagin finds the clothes and walks off with them. Later, arrayed in the suit he has found, the hobo peers over a fence and sees a farmer sleeping near some beehives. The hobo accidentally knocks the hives over. The bees emerge and make things hum for the farmer and the hobo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/knZK7hkWxPLjqIKgd6I1Lgwweb9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frayed Fagin's Adventures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
