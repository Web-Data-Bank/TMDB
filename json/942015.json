The water looks even more enticing as he views it at that long distance from the top. As he jumps indiscriminately toward the water without surveying his surroundings, he may find that the water below is a little less enticing the closer and closer he gets to it, which may be, by that time, too late. The moral: look before you leap.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7hH3VipAdRTfQbdyXyEH9ERBSvZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1954-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Look Before You Leap","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
