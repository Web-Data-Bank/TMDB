It gave me a mixed feeling that on the one hand, I was wondering why this young boy had gone missing while on the other hand, I felt that somehow I became the one that people were looking for because of the clothes. The weird anxiety that the absence of me might cover the real absence of the boy fulfilled me the whole time till I got back home, and the video of this work was taken within that time. The sounds were recorded from the original broadcast.  ​","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mlz02EsjQAAsENpSAcFj6BpY1NC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Someone who can’t go back home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
