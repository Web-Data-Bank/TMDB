Saiga, an extremely fastidious man, is the number one salesman of condoms. But in reality, he is a rebel who denies the existence of human beings and challenges God to stop the birth of more \"life\". But selling condoms is not enough to stop the population from growing. He becomes impatient and finally decides on a new strategy: indiscriminate murder. The film is a well-constructed hellscape that draws you in, and the Jack Nicholson-like protagonist dominates the screen with his overwhelming presence. A hard-hitting feature-length drama with terrifying visuals that depicts the \"crime and punishment\" of a single act of madness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2E7fDdHXSSr2OsHPulyuQv0a3wY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
