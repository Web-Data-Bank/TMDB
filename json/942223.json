Then, fragments of daily life are written on the screen in an unhurried manner. When the dialogue and the screen are fused together, there is an exquisite sense of mismatch, and a warm and heart-warming world begins to unfold on the screen. The film is a humorous essay in the form of a letter to a lover, telling the story of an ordinary day, but with a descriptive power that is anything but ordinary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iRVGveHkNXvGbwezLuclOJpG6b7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Letter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
