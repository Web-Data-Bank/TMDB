These three gaijin fakirs ignore the rules and common sense of the world and put on a crazy performance. They are the young people of the end of the century who live in the mood of \"the world is going to be all right, it's only a paradise now\". They walk to the Kinkakuji Temple, the place of the last banquet, with the unmistakable presence of Japanese young people behind their cheap make-up. Taking photos with junior high school students on a school trip and avoiding real gaijin, their hymn to youth comes to an end... A funny and ultimately sad \"true story of stupid people\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yTt7gKyIr5IvqkwAVlVohfxn0FZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White, Black, Indian","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
