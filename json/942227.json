The hands of the young, the old, the men, the women, the hands of all generations, sometimes in everyday life, sometimes in extraordinary situations, are the focus of this film, which with its superb powers of observation vividly reveals the drama of human life and its vicissitudes hidden in everyday life. Like a game of cat's-paw, in which a thread is passed between fingers to form a shape, the filmmaker's ability to connect unconnected scenes to form a larger theme shines through.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jwcIeftaNiCNJIZZLRu5EBdB0xB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
