Apart from their different hair-do, they look alike. They have never seen each other before, but soon find out that they are identical twins. It turns out that their parents divorced, each keeping one of the girls. They decide to trade places at the end of the summer. Lottie curls her hair, Lisa braids hers, and both go off to where they have never been before. The adventure begins.","popularity":2.377,"poster_path":"/vOa7zSwR92LSSm6KqncKYZP9HNi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carlton-Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1704,"logo_path":"/sb3PuMTgJgpPUY7x634etBAhodu.png","name":"Bavaria Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1950-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Times Lotte","video":false,"vote_average":6.423,"vote_count":13}
