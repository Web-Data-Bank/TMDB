Amon Goeth was a prominent Nazi leader and commandant of the Plaszow concentration camp. Utterly ruthless and sadistic, he murdered thousands of Jews and others during WWII. After seeing Ralph Fiennes's portrayal of him in Schindler's List, Goeth's daughter Monika began a quest to come to terms with his evil legacy. Together with Helen Jonas, a survivor of the Holocaust and Goeth's slave, the two women unearth the personal cost of crimes that consumed millions and question whether a parent's actions can ever be truly laid to rest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/txuvXlVbUWzkQLIYEs37wTyeHPH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Father was a Nazi Commandant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
