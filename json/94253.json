So Tarzan, his ditsy, oversexed distaff companion Jane (an endearingly daffy Tallie Cochrane, Wright's real-life wife), and their lunkhead son Boy (some vacuous California surfer dude type who calls himself Uncle Tom) embark on a perilous pilgrimage to Wango Wango Land in order to get Tarzan another penis.","popularity":1.694,"poster_path":"/6bW34Kbw49Dhd0v7gwRu7rjuMEr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tarz & Jane, Cheeta & Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
