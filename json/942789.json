About the readiness to rush to the rescue at any time of the day or night, to any point of the earth. Despite the war, despite the closed borders. This is a movie about the fact that there are no other people's children. That every child's life is priceless. About how important it is to help, protect, protect everyone who needs, here and now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live!
