She strokes its seats and even sleeps there after long nights at the bar. It is, she admits, just like being with a person you couldn≈Ωt live without. Anja Salomonowitz made a quiet little film about Carmen, observing her as she moves through the empty theater, as she puts in only brief appearances at home and immediately returns to the base station. After being forced to watch as her last theater was transformed into a supermarket, Carmen considers movie theaters to be erotic but also endangered environments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
