The exhibition consists of the titular multi-channel video projected and displayed on sculptural, kinetic screens alongside new drawings of scenes from the world of the CAPS. One screen, broadcasting what could be an A.I.-generated children’s video, is topped by helicoptering ropes that slap the gallery walls. Inspired by the compilation structure and synesthetic drive of Disney’s Fantasia (1940), Guided Tour of a Spill centers less on overt narrative and more on the visceral and sensorial pleasure of music, dance, athletics and humor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8OK8HDzcSTnHZyifNmBXLMQtydj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guided Tour of a Spill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
