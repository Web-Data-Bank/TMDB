One day, Ichita receives a small gun. One day, Ichita receives a small pistol in the mail, and the two set off on a random journey in a stolen car. On the way, they pick up a couple, a blonde woman and a quiet motorcyclist, who have no idea where they are going or why. These two are also living their own lives, far from reality. The car with the four people in it goes on a long way...  The dialogue is casual but stylish. The light oldies pop music is in the background. It's a cool road movie with an unrealistic setting and a mood that mixes speed and weariness. The film was shot on location in Hokkaido, where the road is straight and endless. The filming in the vast landscape brings the characters into sharp focus. The journey of these outlaws, who can only live halfway, is shown in a dashing, unconventional and freestyle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jwRFQ1U3R5OdJsxrccivEnC2QJH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Cityに寄らず","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
