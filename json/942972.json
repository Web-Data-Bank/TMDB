A young boy, Mamoru, realizes that all the murders have something in common and confides in his friend Takeshi. A tooth was always pulled out of the corpse. A new victim had also had his teeth pulled. Then they see a man who looks like the sheriff at the scene. Takeshi says that all the adults in the town are the enemy, and scares Mamoru by telling him that when it really hurts, he can't even speak. Takeshi grabs a slingshot and tries to attack the sheriff, looking as if he is possessed by something. Eventually, Mamoru discovers something unexpected in Takeshi's house...  The two boys are played by women, which makes the film seem like a fantasy, but don't underestimate the suspense, which is carefully calculated. The camerawork for the climax, the action scene in the attic, is also very good. The tempo of the action in the first half of the film is so good that it is shown in one go.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2XSL1KIRIhtNoIBfucU4gu7JYWM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"花粉症の森","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
