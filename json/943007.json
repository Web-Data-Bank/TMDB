Two brothers, both aspiring to become professional musicians, live a carefree life. A young woman moves into the flat next door to theirs. Soon the three hit it off and she begins to sing in the brothers' band. But just when they are all feeling a little emotional, the brother goes off on his own.  The film is richly unified and full of taste, from the characters' clothes to the sweets beside them, the locations and the books they find. Maybe it's just a hobby of the director, but when it appears on the screen it becomes something that can be called aesthetically pleasing, and we feel the emergence of a filmmaker with an extravagant sensibility. The seemingly trivial dialogue also captures the emotional landscape of a generation that does not speak its mind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Bc31EcJwZfYV5NM6zw5AzN3lOv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ピクニック","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
