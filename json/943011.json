It's been a long time since all the relatives of the Yoshimoto family gathered at the main house. Grandma was in a critical condition. As everyone looked on at her bedside, she murmured. Bananas...\". Does Grandma want to eat bananas so badly? My grandson runs. Every time a box of bananas that he has worked so hard to get is plucked and placed in the mouths of his relatives, a little piece of drama emerges.  I want to eat the last banana. This bizarre and comical setting is a true story that the director read in a magazine once. The conversations between men, daughters-in-law and grandchildren that take place at family gatherings are stereotypical and familiar to everyone. The boringness of the film, on the contrary, results in a contrast between life and death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w1dnWqeXW6iHCEMMUEL7Nh4iTBT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"クール・バナナ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
