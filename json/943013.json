Cross the city and defeat the enemy.  In the future, baseball has become a murderous game in which cyborgs, enhanced for baseball, fight for their lives. Today, in a city abandoned by humans, the game is played on the entire city. He literally defeats the traitors and the players of the opposing team who stand in his way, and then he runs, looking at the corpses of the killed players of the same team beside him. He runs for home base.  No matter how many people he kills, no matter who is killed, the cyborg player does not scream, does not shed a tear. No, he may just hide the tears that flow behind his artificial eyelids, the cries that are born in the depths of his artificial throat. In order to fulfill his mission to step on the platform. There is a style that can truly be called \"near-future baseball hard-boiled\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bdteOWe0pSAV1qM1wANWqIWxb2I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hosei University Cinema Original Members","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"全滅野球軍","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
