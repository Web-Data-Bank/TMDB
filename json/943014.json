There is an elderly couple who live together. The husband still works, albeit sparingly, and the wife does the housework. They eat together, know each other's tastes, and talk a little while watching TV. The film is a quiet account of their unhurried life together.  The camera's gaze is quiet but gentle as it carefully follows the old couple, interspersed with summer scenes from the countryside, like a documentary. The camera's gaze is quiet but gentle, and the occasional embarrassing gestures and expressions on the couple's faces give the viewer a sense of closeness to the camera (and to the people holding it). The old man is a very picturesque subject even when he is just standing there, but this film has a peculiar rhythm to it, which may be staged or naturalistic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/19x8Cy9h37IpLHg52ndJBp66sEh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hosei University Cinema Original Members","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"友達に逢う列車","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
