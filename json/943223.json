Body memorials, survivor stories, remembrances. Both plagues are reframed by neoliberalism and its central mythology of personal freedom, brilliantly laid out in Hito Steyerl’s essay gem “Freedom from Everything” which is adapted and shapeshifted here. Pronouncing on the new precarity of the freelancer, Hito wryly observes that they have “freedom from everything,” from a good job, health care, affordable housing… Featuring Maggie Thatcher, Guy Fawkes, George Michael, James Baldwin, Akira Kurosawa and David Wojnarowicz.","popularity":1.231,"poster_path":"/aG6zWIcj5BJt0NlzzRnMSiYzzTE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom from Everything","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
