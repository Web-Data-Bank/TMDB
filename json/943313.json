The film takes its title from the first shot, a single take set to Fauré's setting of \"Au bord de l'eau\" by René-François Sully-Prudhomme. The image shows a tree in bloom near a stream, during an extraordinarily long warm streak in February, a dream of spring in the middle of winter outside Chicago. A false spring that doomed the exuberant tree's fruit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sWaTJGZqQuToCoaKtcJYvIYFpEl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prelude (Foreplay/Mourning)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
