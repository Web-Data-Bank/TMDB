With the support of several contributors and personal writings, Gabriele Münter - Pionnière de l'art moderne, retraces the life of one of the most illustrious figures of the German expressionist movement of the Blue Rider and draws up the portrait of a singular artist, whose work, intimate and human, testifies to the complexity of her time as much as that of her own existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hbDIBIIUfnPMXZwqnMiSEQPzGft.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gabriele Münter - Pionnière de l'art moderne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
