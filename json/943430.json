Islanders go about in their daily microcosms - in the kitchen, in the garden, in the workplace and in their \"hangouts\", when researchers invade asking for something rather personal. A clash of energies rises between locals and perplexed scientists that leaves no stone unturned, in the attempt to understand frozen time and intriguing idiosyncrasies. A comedic study in pacing and reframing a world view.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tfQEEVA13RBCTK4HqnKxLoKpGYE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Microbiome","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
