But the most difficult thing is to push a wheelchair. Diane is in the desert. Diane is pushing Fred, that slightly heavy guy she had two dates with before he gave her a stroke. Alreadỳ that for a sophisticated little Parisian like Diane, it didn't fit with Fred, now she finds herself having to change him when he pees himself. She can't take it anymore. The question is: how to get rid of this handicapped man? So Diane takes advantage of the fact that Fred has distant relatives who live in the desert not far from the Festival. She takes him to visit, but she hopes that his family will keep him and that she will be rid of him. Finally! Only their car has failed them, their water is limited, and the desert is still long. Not to mention the dangerous people they come across. If they want to get out of it, they will have to walk fast. Especially Diane.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vuU7ZYx0QjVbiDOMQAvReAFxjN3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matsylie Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Désertitude","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
