Tokuichi was at one time a prominent figure in an amateur band. Now he's unemployed, behind on his rent and alimony for his divorced wife and children. One day, his old bandmate, Kiichi, invites him to be the singer of his new band. When he goes to his shop to ask her about it, he finds the woman he had met before waiting for him with a message from Kiichi. The two hit it off and go to Kiichi's training camp, but when they arrive, the band has already broken up.  A man who is clumsy and always misses his luck, a man who eats up other people's dreams and is always on the move, and a woman who stands dangerously between the two. The more the story progresses, the more we see the many facets of each of them, and the more the story lingers. From the noisy dialogues and cuts, music can be heard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r6xMmolOuEnd7ayElQbiWoLR6qG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He tells me to be a respectable person...like my dad.","title":"こわれもの","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
