A woman, always frustrated, forces him to pick pockets and rob people just for the thrill of it. A man who resists but continues to be an accomplice with infinite tolerance. Is it the man or the woman who is desperate to keep his partner in line? It is the woman's brother who comes between the frustration and tolerance that seems to swell endlessly. But as he makes her apologise at the graveside of her parents, he also commits the sin of lying in order to keep his love alive.  There is very little expository dialogue. There is very little exposition in the film, but it is enough to convey the feelings and circumstances of each character. The structure, the script and the acting are the foundations of a film that succeeds in depicting the birth of a new love triangle in a cool and realistic way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9R6Q5KCgLfFKc3yqrRpJ2J84rFk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"悲しいだけ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
