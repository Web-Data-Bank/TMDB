Shizuko is always a little in the wrong place at the wrong time. On the day of her graduation ceremony, she finds out that the boy she's been eyeing has a girlfriend, and on top of that, he hears the sound of her stomach growling. She is so shocked that she runs up to the rooftop and meets a girl named Sorae. She says that she hates school and loves to sit on the roof and look at the sky, which makes Shizuko forget her sadness. Sorae also opens her heart to Shizuko, who, like her, is not good at what she does, but somehow likes school. On the day of the graduation ceremony, the two classmates exchange words for the first time and go home together like best friends.  The Osaka dialect and the careful, unpretentious imagery subtly create the warm, fluffy quality of the title.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fHW4fX758Je5tDU5dGOCgLpwhCf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"春風","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
