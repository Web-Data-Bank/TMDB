The Wind That Held Us Here uses images and sound captured at Point Pelee National Park, as well as poetic text, to explore the concept of transmigration. The visual style uses monochromatic tones to isolate the shapes and natural features of the park, inviting the viewer to focus on the invisible but always present wind. The film is intended as a visual expression of the fleeting wind and ever-passing time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p8vQSaX2oOZBsiG1tYwEZGeU7bX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wind That Held Us Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
