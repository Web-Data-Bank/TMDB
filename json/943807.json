But since the early 20th century Iceland’s 400+ glaciers have been melting steadily, now losing roughly 11 billion tons of ice every year; scientists predict that all of Iceland’s glaciers will be gone by 2200. One of Iceland’s smallest known glaciers is named “Ok.” Not Ok is its story. This is not a tale of spectacular, collapsing ice. Instead, it is a little film about a small glacier on a low mountain--a mountain who has been observing humans for a long time and has a few things to say to us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bV4v4rJSUKY5MC3ihzYEkMNgNEd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Little Movie About a Small Glacier at the End of the World","title":"Not Ok Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
