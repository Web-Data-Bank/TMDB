The owner, a local influential politician, has avoided paying for the maintenance of the building under the legal standards by using his connections to proclaim the building a national cultural heritage. However, the rent he has been charging was as if the building were an object that offered standard comfort. The only German tenant takes the crew around and speaks of his battle against the landlordâ€™s manipulation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":170647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alligator Film (Munich)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Protection of the State","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
