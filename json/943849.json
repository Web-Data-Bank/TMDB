Since 2018 Tosatti has concentrated all his practice on a project entitled \"My Heart is a Void, the Void is a Mirror\", an episodic visual novel, developed around the world with the aim of witnessing the state of crisis of democracy in the West. The Odessa Episode - which follows the stages of Catania, Riga and Cape Town - is the installation developed by the artist after a long period spent in Ukraine, in the most dramatic moment of the Covid-19 emergency, when the country was closed to foreigners. The film recounts the efforts made to carry out a powerfully visionary work in those difficult months.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eRTL5WEuzDdmeFbwcfUpr3jWNbx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"My Heart is a Void, the Void is a Mirror - Odessa Episode","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
