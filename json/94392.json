It was a titanic battle between two of the sport's true greats, Michael Schumacher - in his final F1 season - and Fernando Alonso. Eventually the drivers' championship was decided at the very end of a gripping season.  Three \"new\" teams appeared on the grid in 2006 - Scuderia Toro Rosso (formerly Minardi), Midland F1 (formerly Jordan) and BMW Sauber (formerly Sauber BMW). Super Aguri Honda were a genuinely new team who just barely made it to the first grand prix.  Rule changes included engine limitations (2.4 litre and 8 cylinders), a new qualifying format and the return of tyre changes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/opqxpvJPOE8iOcStC4vWCj790WU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Once Again!","title":"2006 FIA Formula One World Championship Season Review","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
