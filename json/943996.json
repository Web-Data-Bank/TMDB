Collaborating with William Johnston, a photographer and scholar of Japanese history, Otake’s multidisciplinary project transforms the irradiated landscape into a site for performance. The artist’s movements—in empty train stations, overgrown roads, tsunami-damaged buildings, along broken seawalls, and amidst makeshift memorials—dwell in the residue of life before the meltdown while also charting the passage of time in these inhabitable lands. A Body in Fukushima is culled from tens of thousands of photographs, whose mournful but resolute march creates a “letter to the future.” “My body will carry a piece of Fukushima,” writes the artist, “I hope the [viewer’s] sense of their own distance to Fukushima might also change.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/84D3WFfwDU01I6hn4dg7aw0rajj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Body in Fukushima","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
