Arielle Bordow directs and co-stars in “Craigslist Roommate,” a free-spirited 16mm snapshot of fluid relationships and shared living. When the wandering Addie moves to Madison, Wisconsin, she responds to a Craigslist ad to share a house with a couple, Xena and Lake. The open-minded trio begin to share moments of intimacy and connection — Addie and Xena in particular hit it off — but soon are beset with boundary issues, insecurities and resentments. (Also, Lake is allergic to Addie’s cat). The film perfectly captures early 20’s life of a certain alt subculture — it’s teeming with authenticity, dryly funny, and refreshingly candid in its sexual explorations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hJHYbAtFf4LTEXdqi9z0FMicx2F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Craigslist Roommate","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
