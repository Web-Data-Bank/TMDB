With Britain’s youth facing similar socio-political challenges to those that provided a dark backdrop to rave’s early years, Amazon Music explores UK rave’s story to date, and where it might be going next.  ‘Better Days’ documents over 30 years of UK rave culture; from the first wave of illegal free parties to lockdown gatherings during the global pandemic and everything in between. Featuring interviews with Prospa, Sherelle, Orbital, Dance System, TSHA, and more.  The documentary also features an original Score by Overmono, and two Amazon Original remixes:  Dance System Feat.
