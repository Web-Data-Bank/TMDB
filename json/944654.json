The film honours the past and the iconic Thom McGinty, the Diceman, who was one of the first to speak openly in Ireland about having AIDS but, other than that, itâ€™s very firmly rooted in the here and now. Based on a theatre show, the stories in this film move between bodies of young men, migrant women, drag artists and activists. A form-flipping documentary, it features a cast of actors as well as ordinary people coming out on screen for the first time.","popularity":0.678,"poster_path":"/bLFeaZea8orhrZnw9OUAgqblvnK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Tell a Secret","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
