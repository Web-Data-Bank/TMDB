It is a period piece featuring housewife Marcia, whose whimsical notions about dust and dirt take a dark turn when she encounters Mucor, the god of decay. Itâ€™s a story about art, metaphysics, obsessive compulsion and second wave feminism. Told through a fascinating character, an ingenious but profoundly conflicted individual, who comes unstuck amid the transformation of gender rules in 1970s suburban London.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7sRyVLm0YHKdMIfvHSr5HsBoGtR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Limits of Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
