We are allowed to sit on three therapeutic sessions to hear the confessions as M.M. reenacts her past: becomes demure, becomes hurt, disassociates. Her \"Mum\" is indicted: peasant, barely literate, wanting her daughter to be happy, \"to be married\" as she says in her last letter. The irony is immense: defining the abuse as secret shame, never confronting \"Mr. Goertler,\" Mum wishes her daughter to attain social liberation in the shape for a happy (mythic?) marriage.\" -- Abigail Child","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mary Magdaline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
