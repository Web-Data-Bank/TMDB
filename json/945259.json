A man who likes to reason and seems to be able to talk as much as he wants, and a woman whose words cannot keep up with her feelings. The two young lovers have opposite personalities and quarrel constantly over trivial matters. However, their quarrels usually end with the man arguing unilaterally, but that day was different. The woman's resentment exploded. Will it be the end for them?  A little love that exists everywhere. The quarrels and make-ups that all lovers repeat. The film succeeds in creating a love that is unique to these two people by casually but carefully depicting \"why does he love her like that\" and \"why does she love him like that\", despite the fact that this is a typical example.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8xQsPhbrPYYH78UhLlaB4BEYcjx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170912,"logo_path":null,"name":"U-38","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ちまたに雨の降るごとく","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
