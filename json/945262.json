A man is walking carrying a hearse. His steps stop at a grave. The man buries the hearse he has been carrying in the hole and lies down in it. The closed hearse is covered with soil, by whoever's hand, it was. At the same time, a number of hearses identical to the man's are quietly washed out to sea.  The rituals of the protagonists, who are presumably not of high culture, towards their own life and death are the height of simplicity and holiness. The camera quietly following them has the power to make us wonder if such practices really exist. A beautiful and sad poetic portrayal of death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/RQR9a1FV1wxfNYluHtbIdkm09k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"アンゲルス","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
