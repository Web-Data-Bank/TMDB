Art students Naoya and Kono. They are different types but like each other. They ask Reiko, an art model who comes to their drawing class, to be their model for an extra-curricular production. The two are simultaneously attracted to her shadowy side, but while Kono falls straight for Reiko, Naoya worries that he is unable to portray her true self, and begins to search for a veil over Reiko's true face.  Kono receives pocket money from his companion's lover through mother-son-like conversations. Naoya visits Reiko's house and takes off his coat in front of the front door. The accumulation of small details creates quiet pauses that not only highlight the outlines of the characters, but also give the film an elegance and tranquillity that is probably a quality of the director.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mZt1QdXS5ymZ63gWsFazmjAxATB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"常世の恋人","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
