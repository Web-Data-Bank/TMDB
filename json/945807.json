It opens with Prakash, a road engineer, leaving for a site visit to an unnamed village. On the way he gives a lift to Jaffer, someone who previously sold pirated dvds, and receives a set of road movies from him. The sequences in the films and the people that Prakash meets in life begin to resonate with each other. Jaffer’s pronouncement that Prakash’s life could be a film comes back to him as he witnesses each person starring in their own road movie.  The road carries us, connects us, it equally disrupts lives. The film explores this ambivalence and the different temporalities people inhabit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gRKoTqViBHCnUczI5tMdmk9LUoE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moving Focus Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wind Seed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
