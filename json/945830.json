Instead of echoing that cacophony, The Death of Us, quietly reflects on a range of cases in which the death penalty was pronounced. Sometimes, ending in the execution of the convicted; sometimes in commutation to a life sentence; and sometimes to acquittal and release. Speaking to some who have been on death row, and others closely involved with the cases, we engage in complex conversations on crime and punishment, revenge and justice, popular rhetoric and personal experiences. Only to find ourselves confronted by larger ethical and moral questions across time and space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AiA6EWohULeOK9Y2vgDc8OxgIHF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66632,"logo_path":"/alQJKHLQlV3EFkCshP5pyLfI3z0.png","name":"Doordarshan","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"},{"english_name":"Telugu","iso_639_1":"te","name":"తెలుగు"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The death of us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
