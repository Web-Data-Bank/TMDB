Jane repays his kindness by secret envy and hate, and her chief passion in life is the hoarding of the money given her and counting it over and over. On the surface, however, she is suave and smiling. On only one thing does she palpably show the hate which settles within her; she detests Shep, the beautiful and intelligent collie dog belonging to Beatrice and the idol of her heart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":166440,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Pals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
