In the city of gold as they call it, Palenque, Jean, Rose and Machete find themselves immersed in a marginal world trying to survive with the opportunities that the city offers them, with the anguish of being deported, with the temptation of the easily earned money. They look for another El Dorado or return, broken by the environment, from where they came. Some flee, others die in this sordid environment. They are human beings, mostly Colombians, who live in Venezuelan society, whose culture they enrich, perverting or adopting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Por los caminos verdes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
