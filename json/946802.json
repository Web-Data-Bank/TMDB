In pursuit of 15million clicks of fame and money, and a career as a youtuber, outgoing Rikke seeks the dangerous thrill of UrbEx stunts as a way to numb his loss and pain. Aiden, more introverted, seeks solace in Parkour, while working menial jobs to pay for his increasing reliance on alcohol. As they process Nye's tragic death, deeper scars from difficult childhoods emerge. Exclusive rights to 10 years of their self-shot archive reveal a rich story of their formative years. As we watch the stunts with sweaty palms and open mouths, we ultimately engage with the warmth and humanity of these two extraordinary young men.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/miwmDL4gazRUMAKpBATXObRYm9R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Faction Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":100444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Faction North","origin_country":""},{"id":116911,"logo_path":"/9mK6pb8iphmoGCmXMkXUUmz3u1O.png","name":"perfectmotion","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Off The Rails","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
