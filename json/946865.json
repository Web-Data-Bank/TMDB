To attract pupils to sign for joining, Weiqiang Du tells students that “anyone who joins the rope skipping team will be given a new team uniform and shoes.” Two brothers named Jiang Hai and Jiang He thus join the team. However, they are “punished” by senior team members, including Xiaoqin Fang and Yuxiang Ren. Unable to endure the hard training, these two brothers want to exit from the team repeatedly. But when a volunteer teacher named Yuxin Feng joins the rope skipping team, bringing in new concepts and techniques, things change for the better. Eventually, the rope skipping team makes leapfrog development. Now all of the team members insist on practicing for the World Rope Skipping Championship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aTo8UbRtFXigGs8cWdYsZnQsoYb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2019-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starry Road","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
