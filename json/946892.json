On top of that, she turns 28 today, and everyone knows 28 is the new 30, and 30 is the beginning of the end for any woman with plans to get married or become a mother. She wakes up the morning after her birthday party with an unknown man in her bed and a strange feeling in her stomach. A pharmacy test confirms her suspicion - she is pregnant. The news spread like wildfire and soon Martha was enjoying the attention and love she had longed for a month before. When she finds out it's a sham pregnancy, something breaks in Martha and she decides to simply keep this news to herself. Even a non-baby is better than the cul-de-sac in which she found herself before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5EdW6GqaTYvgSwGpHxtW4J92rL8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skyn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
