The evening goes off the rails right from the start when the male host couple reveal a closely guarded secret: there's also a hostess in the house, and she's very pregnant! Of course, the frantic group of relatives don't take the news lightly and demand the paternity to be confirmed - which is no simple task. A series of misunderstandings drives the Christmas guests to the brink of a nervous breakdown, and as the evening progresses, Santa Claus himself is forced to look in the mirror. Their Christmas together seems doomed to failure until, to everyone's surprise, the evening culminates in a heart-melting Christmas miracle.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":"/4WGlxmQxi6Mqw0Iuo3AqVMHwUdn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68201,"logo_path":"/3Vog1dP5hSbutyzNZf9zvM2RGNn.png","name":"Don Films","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kulkuset kulkuset","video":false,"vote_average":3.333,"vote_count":3}
