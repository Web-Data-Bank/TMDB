Papier mâché puppets ride machines and manipulate robots strange to the human eye. A great masquerade is in the planning, and the air crackles with excitement. Plunged into the joys and frustrations of creating costumes, the zealous puppets produce a bumper crop, each one more elaborate than the last. The film illustrates the creative process, with its inevitable pitfalls and rewards. It says that to create is to be alive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m7gnp6BArPZy0BVtP1CSk8sWpWr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masquerade","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
