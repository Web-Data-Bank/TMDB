Audry, who wanted to use her knowledge of Japanese to help her husband Ward, a golf instructor, enter the professional league of golf, has to learn the same thing: she lets the sleazy lawyer Rictus persuade her to play Sushi-Jo - a kind of living salver for the Japanese national dish â€“ to be able to unobtrusively overhear a meeting with Japanese business people.
