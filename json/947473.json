Using a technique I call \"FLYING CAMERA\" where I use a lightweight camera to roam over the human female body to create the illusion of flying bodies. Also experimenting with quick intercuts of black and white abstractions that create grays in between. Music is a collage of Edgar Varese's \"IONIZATION\" and Luciano Berio's \"VISAGE\" with Kathy Berberian's vocals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8wIbMueWQhTTQnxAP6yw1Z4qO49.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High Contrast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
