After a performance, it goes wrong: 17-year-old acrobat, Juul, falls into a coma. The doctor pronounces her brain dead. Her father, magician Bor, wanting to keep his daughter with him, kidnaps her from the hospital. When he performs with Juul as a living puppet, the general public rush back to fill the stands. Bor is convinced that he’s doing his little girl credit by allowing her to shine once more in the circus. But within Juul, the inner frenzy and despair grow. In silent protest against the humiliations and the loss of her own will, she slowly trans­forms into living porce­lain, until she falls apart into pieces.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/viWrIEZKfctXhCG4DhZOd9lMcWp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Juul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
