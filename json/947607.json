This seems to trigger something in their most legendary player, Jonny Mosquera: a terrible syndrome that makes him literally fall to his knees.  Like La hamaca, Agarrando pueblo, Carne de tu Carne and other films made by Mayolo, this film blends deeply unsettling imagery and lowkey genre filmmaking into an equally unsettling and exhilarating realism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rodilla negra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
