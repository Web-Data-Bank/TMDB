One day, she discovers ​“Sultana’s Dream” by the Bengali writer Rokeya Hossein (Pairabond, Bangladesh 1880 — Kolkata 1932). Published in Madras in 1905, the book describes Ladyland: a utopian country where women are scientists and govern the state while men live in segregation, ignorant and afraid. Seduced by the story, Inés gifts herself a trip to India behind the traces of Rokeya. It is an initiatory adventure as a young woman and future author.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1SUuS5VAHzVchuQJxTvbDcEvsPt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87825,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abano Producións","origin_country":""},{"id":172297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uniko Estudio Creativo","origin_country":""},{"id":150015,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Gatoverde Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":118029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sparkle Animation","origin_country":""},{"id":172298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stelmo Production","origin_country":""},{"id":172299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vamos Animation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Sultana's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
