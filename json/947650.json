Just before the Christmas, a new odd girl with thick glasses moves into Tony’s house. Shelly has a strange way of expressing herself. Tony is fascinated by her but he is also being cautious at first. Together with Shelly’s flashlight, they explore their house and they are slowly getting to know each other. The kids have to join all their efforts to figure out who’s behind the circuit of dark cracks that sucks out all the light bulbs, even the daylight. It must be because of the ​“Spirit of the house”. A film about being different, about friendship, and first loves… But above all about light and darkness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kEZNnlWQOgrojQekXIzqMxz3tIt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116930,"logo_path":"/ztepEIiRhE5yJSGxCCUHXsUunJJ.png","name":"nutprodukcia","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":20810,"logo_path":"/hBLCynl7e2l2w4Ro6SnS1a2FrME.png","name":"Nutprodukce","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":110516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmfabriq","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":24023,"logo_path":"/yz6m1ty4qGvlkfReuqPZxdmD8V2.png","name":"RTVS","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Tony, Shelly and the Spirit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
