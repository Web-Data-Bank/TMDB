Over six years, they rowed a fair distance. breakSurface documents these travels, and the extent to which Greer’s world is leavened with debilitating anxiety. Greer’s powerful sculpture is visually simple, conceptually complex, but silent; he identifies with Jonathan Swift’s \"man of objects\" who lays out things, not words, to be understood. Applegath, however, doesn’t make this film to replace words, but by embracing them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sWDps3ublGrT9BIAu4yoRINywjz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"breakSurface","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
