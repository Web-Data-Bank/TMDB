Downs also documents his family life; his wife, Anita, and daughter Lila appear throughout the 8-minute short. Distinguished by its frenetic pace—cutting sharply between saturated images and frequently showing scenes sped up to multiple times their normal pace—Love Shots also exhibits Downs’s fascination with conspicuous consumption, manifested in various images of advertising, shopping, and scenes from amusement parks.” —Ruth Hodgins, Walker Art Center","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Shots","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
