Neither her dress nor her blood alcohol level, or even her supposedly «sexual» attitude mentioned by the defense managed to minimize the seriousness of the facts: she did not consent to sexual intercourse. This conviction comes in a particular context of collective awareness on sexual violence. It is symptomatic of a change of mentalities. A symbolic, but equally universal story in the post #MeToo era.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6PeQS9i2vLja9afzWAuzintgfj7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magneto Presse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spanton vs The French Police","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
