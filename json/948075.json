Shot in Bangalore and Delhi, the film scripts the work of five performing artists into a sensorially rich meditation on desireâ€™s vexed status as at once, animating force, object of suspicion and ground of contention.  De Sidere 7 is conceived as a videocontemplation: a formally plural, multilayered composition intended to be experienced as an integrated whole. The artist book plays with image, frame, text, process notes & artist-critic responses to stage an encounter with the film in print duration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bIlEkKpAbBTMfKZ9FAlrZHpoRD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Sidere 7","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
