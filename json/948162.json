The eye occasionally blinks, looks down and is covered with an eyelid for a few seconds. It is a paradoxically peaceful video. There is a certain promise and visual tension that something is about to happen, but nothing ever happens. The image of the eye fades out to black after ten minutes. The question remains: is this videotaped omnipresent eye providential or ominous?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye for I","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
