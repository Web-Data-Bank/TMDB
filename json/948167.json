The images of women dwelling within the exterior and interior spaces are complemented by a narration recounted with a female voice. The poetic story is doubled up by an echo-like delay on a second audio track. This fact emphasizes the ambiguous character of the subject as one and/or many. The 2:30 minute long text is recounted mainly in English, but there are three short audio segments where Polish, Italian, English and French sentences are pronounced simultaneously creating an uncanny audio-cacophony. This new non-language enriches the ideas of walking on one hand, and on being grounded, on the other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wanderlust","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
