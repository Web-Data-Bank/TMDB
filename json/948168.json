All the scenes of the video are in slow motion. Kinga Araya climbs wooden stairs to get to the top of Mount Royal. Dressed in black, she wears a beautiful, yet cumbersome and dangerous copper hat (adjustable refers to the copper band inside the Headgear to fit almost any human head). When she finally reaches the lookout, she continues to walk in a circle. She finishes her 'Royal Promenade' with a final spin, in the middle of this picturesque public space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/leIWy11Ks1e4KNs86NhDanMXXst.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exercising with Princess Headgear (Adjustable)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
