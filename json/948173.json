While standing on two balancing iron hemispheres and attempting to play the violin, I revisit the present and past memories that sculptured my body and my mind. In particular, I aspire to take the viewer on an uneasy journey that would allow him/her to contemplate on what is idiotic and paradoxical about our human nature. In order to forge my artistic and personal credo I need to question my current status quo and challenge it during a peripatetic exercise.\" - King Araya","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9tqniTLZDTxwW1NwREqZrwsdTEV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peripatetic Exercise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
