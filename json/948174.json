I also have a shiny helmet that encloses my brain and protects my face with two elegantly cut out metallic side sheets. And then imagine me, standing in the middle of the room and \"exercising my tongue\", stretching it, pulling it out, and perhaps inflicting pain upon myself while being covered by this ambivalently protective device while trying to pronounce inaudible words. As I am making my \"beautifully threatening\" instrument for the straight and correct (ortho) pronunciations of the words (orthoepy) right here and now, I realize that I am setting up conditions for the war. This war will be fought for the sake of \"just words\" and it will certainly require proper arms of justice - an elongated iron tongue and a defensive helmet.\" - Kinga Araya","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sIog0teomHJANhIuedvB6rdLsVt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orthoepic Exercise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
