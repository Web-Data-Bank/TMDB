There are shots of people drowning, scary wraith-like figures menacing kids in a fight, and the band members delivering babies as the sands of time surround them — all in reverse. It’s a visual feast, courtesy of director Robert Gwisdek, for an epic ballad in the group’s signature style, as frontman Till Lindemann sings in German about wishing time to stand still.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/om9hrvedX1Zd8gev4tt84oUBnaA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kreisfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rammstein - Time","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":3}
