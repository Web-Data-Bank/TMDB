In place of the governments, multinational corporations and religious institutions of the 20th century is the Overlord, a global despot who rules the world from behind his computer mainframe.  But one man has a plan to destabilize this nightmarish existence with a simple question: What if reality was a dream and your dreams could be reality? Orpheus, played by Michael Raven, is the man, and Millennium is one of Raven's masterworks. The Danish sex bomb Katja Kean stars in this chilling preview of the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nxnB99X4NqQKXEcY4gCYths4KLJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sin City","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where Do You Want To Go Tonight?","title":"Millennium","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
