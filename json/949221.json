Composed of images taken on the spot and testimonies, this film forcefully denounces the policy then followed by France in terms of immigration. On the night of December 31, 1969 to January 1, 1970, five black workers died of asphyxiation in a home in Aubervilliers. In the post-68 context, this drama will experience national repercussions, both politically and in the media. Marcel Trillat and Frédéric Variot then produced Étranges Étrangers, a documentary that candidly shows the slums and hovels of Aubervilliers and Saint-Denis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qzazLz1jkVNXt0NbmwSwHrqveoF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Étranges étrangers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
