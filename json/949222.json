How we are as mothers, as fathers or as children. Stories of pain, of hope, of love, or of facing that which was never faced. Disturbing testimonies, but also full of humanity. Crises make us reflect and leave a record of who we are, in case we cease to exist. Visual notes that make up a film about our being and what we say when all certainties collapse.","popularity":1.151,"poster_path":"/A0WptyAvG0BSYVrFlVrgHpbyCP2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1273,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ceneca Producciones","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2022-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mensajes privados","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
