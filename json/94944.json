But on the very day of his arrival a gang carries out a raid on the bank and the people of Tucson, who are suspicious of the new reverend because he carries a gun, immediately blame him for the robbery. The sheriff saves him from lynching by putting him in jail. Then he asks the priest to find the gang and the booty; thus Miller becomes the Reverend Colt. His exceptional skill means that he can shoot hats off people's heads and their pistols from their pockets, but he never kills.","popularity":2.034,"poster_path":"/adWIbqWbGJOwLqqkk55wtaiPTnV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oceania Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":10460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produzione Intercontinentale Cinematografica (PIC)","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1876,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM Films International","origin_country":""},{"id":428,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tal√≠a Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1970-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reverend's Colt","video":false,"vote_average":5.625,"vote_count":8}
