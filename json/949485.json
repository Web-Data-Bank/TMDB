And this is the only recording of James in concert as of 1979. It captures the charismatic and masterful Taylor in a performance highlighted by his sweet, soulful vocals, musical virtuosity, and disarmingly enchanting stage presence. Backed up by a tight, polished band comprised of a stellar cast of musicians (many of whom have played and recorded with Taylor for years) James delivers powerful renditions of his classics \"Sweet Baby James;' \"Carolina On My Mind;' \"Blossom',' and \"Steamroller:' The band features Don Grolnick on keyboards, Danny Kortchmar and Waddy Watchel on guitars, Leland Sklar on bass, David Sanborn on saxophone, and David Lasley and Arnold McCuller on back-up vocals. Superbly shot on a beautiful summer day at the Blossom Music Center in 1979.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iJDeSCG89oikYsg39qDdiEKvgdK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Taylor in Concert","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
