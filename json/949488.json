Threats made against \"trans-exclusionary radical feminists\" are matters of fact and a trend that dares to further normalize abuses against women, if in support of (some of) them. Carefully making use of an already-existing torrent of film, TV, and digital content on subjects of biology, feminism, trans-activism, Terfslurred poses a new introduction to gender and the LGBTQ+ rainbow like it's never appeared before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eEj00leTtaDejwqcYVXEqAWddCk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terfslurred","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
