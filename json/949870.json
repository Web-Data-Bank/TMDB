Since the director learned how to hold a camera, she had gazed at her father through the lens all the time.  This film is a memory of her father. After her father got cancer, they went through all kinds of treatment together, including loss or gain, hope or sorrow.  This unbreakable connection supported them to the very last moment and never faded away.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/QeVCgvvsJI8hqFGWoHvl7Olnb9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hard Good Life II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
