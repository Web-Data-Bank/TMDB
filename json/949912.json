His suicide in 2017 was one of the most shocking moments in sports history, as a person who seemingly had it all: fame, wealth and family, decided he could no longer continue his life. As part of our investigation into Aaron’s death we came across Kyle Kennedy, the last person to see Aaron Hernandez alive and understand just what drove him to murder and ultimately suicide. We had to go inside the prison to talk to the one man who had the perspective into Aaron’s life that finally offered real answers to all the questions left behind. This special presentation is Kyle’s full story of where his life and Aaron's intersected, which gives a perspective that no one else had into the shocking and tragic life of the once-lauded Aaron Hernandez.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tXccgSDdMyn2IN8aww0TuFCzIx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49664,"logo_path":null,"name":"ReelzChannel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It was definitely a relationship.","title":"Aaron Hernandez: Jailhouse Lover Tells All","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
