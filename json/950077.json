His father is a professional robber, so his mother leaves him to raise Karan and his sister Kiran in dignity. However, when Karan comes of age, he supports his fathers nocturnal adventures and becomes a successful burglar.  In college, he falls in love with Priya (Sharbani Mukherjee), the daughter of the wealthy Somnath Arya (Alok Nath). Since he is a burglar, he does not dare to tell Priya about his love—however, he tells Sandwich (Johnny Lever), his loyal friend. Priya is also in love with Karan, but doesn't tell him because she is shy, despite her best friend Nikki's (Rushali) attempts to matchmake the two of them - and things get difficult for her when Sonia (Nilofer) joins the college, who is extremely good-looking and tries to woo Karan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iHZOfeT497359VknNr9YlkwIjnc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaise Kahoon Ke Pyaar Hai","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
