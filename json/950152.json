The film follows the 36-year-old chef, who is as much an artist as a cook, during the six months leading up to the championship and tells the story of an occupation that seems more like an elite sport than anything else. It provides a rare glimpse into Rasmus’ world and the time, passion and belief in oneself necessary to achieve the excellence to become the world’s best Master Chef.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/93Le7DlHCQa52NN06lGQmRv26xZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2011-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World's Finest Chef","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
