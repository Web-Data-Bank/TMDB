This initiative incurs a new artistic language, which turns the level of the figurative into the conceptual, transforming the sculptures into animated puppets as a tribute, on the one hand, to the millenary tradition of the wayang kulit (Asian shadow theatre) that represents Hindu mythology, the Ramayama and the Mahabarata and, on the other, the Popol Vuh, a sacred book of Mayan literature.  The short film tells the story of the brothers Hun and Vucub Hunahpú, who shake the universe playing ball. The theme of Cosmic Twins is based on one of the passages of the Popol Vuh that delves into the emergence of the world and the creation of man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qGDdU1W8piIbM1JTtsSDea5eALD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cosmic Twins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
