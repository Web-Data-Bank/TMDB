Here the exploitation system is precisely exposed. Deportees (from Angola) disembark from a boat. After the humiliating inspection of the bodies, it is the signature, on the finger, of the contract. Then are shown the works – cultivation, harvesting, bagging of cocoa -, as well as “education” and recreation. Contratados were forced into forced labour in violent and abusive conditions. This system, which replaced slavery, remained in force in the African colonies until 1961.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"São Tomé - Agricultural and Industrial","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
