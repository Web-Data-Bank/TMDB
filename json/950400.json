The ancient monuments, the statues of the discoverers, the modern buildings of the settlers’ quarter testify to the Portuguese presence, while the commentary states that the overseas presence is not built on domination but that it is “a cauldron of many ethnic groups, a new Portuguese civilization. Macao is Portugal”. Yet the film shows us that the true urban landscape of the city is Chinese.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Macao, Oriental Jewel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
