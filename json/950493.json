The 600-mile route follows a connection of mostly unpaved back roads that can be ridden on dual-sport and adventure motorcycles or driven in 4×4 and high-clearance 4WD vehicles. The route is usually snow-free July through September.  When Bryce Stevens and Andrew Cull won the 2010 Overland Flag Competition for their proposal to create an off-road route across the state of Washington, they decided to make their vision a reality. In the spring of 2010, the two adventure motorcyclists from the Northwest began scouting and mapping a new off-road route across Washington State from Oregon to Canada for dual-sport adventure motorcycles and 4×4 vehicles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kJowuHmXUvfy0wzkQXhJutrZGvS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Washington BDR","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
