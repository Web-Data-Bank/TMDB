For Kolei, becoming a warrior not only shapes masculinity and personal  identity, but it is also the very foundation on which this community and society  root their lives. It is a sacred, guiding pillar.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between the Rains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
