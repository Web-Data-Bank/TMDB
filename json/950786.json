Starting small and building step-by-step, they connected the dots that led from a third-rate burglary at the Watergate Office Building to the resignation of the President of the United States. This documentary asks the question: If two young reporters uncovered a national crime in the White House today, could they be as successful as Woodward and Bernstein were in the 1970s? Through interviews with prominent journalists such Walter Cronkite, Jonathan Alter, Linda Ellerbee, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, we take an insightful look at the state of investigative journalism in America today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xAx1HcrHdW6qkcNbPeeLZx9V1aW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leva FilmWorks","origin_country":""},{"id":17,"logo_path":"/7Qu05UOqxdTGLl3kOvkRBv723Vz.png","name":"Warner Bros.
