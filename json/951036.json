Born and raised on the harsh streets of Magadan, a frigid outpost of the Soviet gulag, Gena is only 21. She stages radical performances in public that become a new form of art and activism. By doing that, she wants to change people’s perception of beauty and queerness and bring attention to the harassment of the LGBTQ+ community. The performances - often dark, strange, evocative, and queer at their core - are a manifestation of Gena’s subconscious. But they come at a price.","popularity":1.452,"poster_path":"/m2QUVzaA7AX4W8USC30aF4LdhXO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Galdanova Films","origin_country":""},{"id":93092,"logo_path":"/6bzhNe066LzwT14dvYmtKNHUK8F.png","name":"Sundance Institute","origin_country":"US"},{"id":151205,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Documentary Association","origin_country":"US"},{"id":149196,"logo_path":null,"name":"InMaat Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":110594,"logo_path":"/n6IN6QhMcLyr8zwPRz43lF1Y2Ew.png","name":"Doc Society","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":195918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sopka Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queendom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
