The film was born as a typical Pasolini intervention: filming the strike of the garbage collectors in Rome, who at the time worked in dramatic health conditions, and filming the humility of their daily work, amidst the waste and scraps of society, in the squares and in the streets. Pasolini also filmed the faces of garbage collectors engaged in claims discussions and the result was an extraordinary anthropological picture of an unknown humanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Appunti per un romanzo sull'immondezza","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
