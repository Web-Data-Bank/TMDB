The film takes us back to the Italy of the 1990s, between Berlusconi’s rise to power and the final reverberations of the 20th century. Ardenza is unexpected and moving, with riveting sensitivity and sensuality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h9fHOQneyYDy4R4qVTEG1p8BHkO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76104,"logo_path":"/9aF2Hw6dnKrhmnADmqWUf65wfUC.png","name":"Novanima Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ardenza","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
