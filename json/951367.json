The antics and light-heartedness that run throughout the film, including the storyline, make it worthy of being called a 'violent film', despite the fact that there are no violent scenes at all. It is also a 'hero film' in that the protagonist has style and sticks to it whether he is hurt or not.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lVFKwyz5mTx7yoHVXcCOhNxmmcL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jogging, when people are watching.","title":"Muscle Influenza","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
