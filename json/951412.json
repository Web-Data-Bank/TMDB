Visualising the people and landscapes as they are there, as casually as they are there, should be a difficult task, just as the protagonist struggled with the writing process. However, the film succeeds in vividly depicting the subtle atmosphere felt only in primary schools and only in junior high school, thanks in part to the fine performances of Watanabe Sayaka and her friends, who brilliantly play everyone from primary schools students to preparatory school students. There are no particularly dramatic episodes, but after watching the film, you will feel nostalgic for all the people in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aei4W4WaAwmRP3orCLy5HoHJdkT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ah, girls forever!","title":"Tamako's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
