Rob Gabe is the director of films such as RETURN HAUNED (2021) & MARA'S LABYRINTH (2021) as well as art videos like VIXEN.  Director Statement:  1230 HOPEWELL ROAD is very much inspired by kink/fetish industrial subcultures, film such as Shinya Tsukamoto’s Tetsuo The Iron Man (1988), analogue aesthetics, and Urban Legends I grew up with as a teenager in Chester County, Pennsylvania. It’s pretty edgelord-y and tampers with dork sided subjects so don’t watch it with Mama-San in the room.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rqoKOobkkbC5JlgQwSug4BLj5ie.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1230 Hopewell Road","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
