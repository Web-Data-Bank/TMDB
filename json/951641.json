A slideshow of static imagery — fragmented body parts in the desert, an orange backdrop, and a digitally-rendered silicone vessel — provide the mise-en-scène for this video, creating an atmosphere of relative calm in stark contrast with the arduous task of fishing and pearl diving . For the artist, this work honors the traditions of these seamen, especially the pearl divers, whose now defunct trade was in its heyday a crucial part of the economy of the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nXdhrJGBEwtI7RJhSM9SAyywvLl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bahara (Men of the sea)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
