One screen displays a computer adventure, a fictional quest in which the alphabet is \"discovered\" for the first time, from an isolated tree in a digital desert to outer space. By taking pixels as fundamental formation units, letters appear, and subsequently shatter or disappear. New possibilities, distorted letters and non-existent combinations emerge. The other screen displays interfaces of vintage computer programs: returning to the pioneering softwares in which Arabic appeared for the first time on the computer screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bju78LbshSb0rxclVAqf4Nr5kkg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Telephone Book","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
