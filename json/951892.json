Martin Durkin's controversial thesis is that Margaret Thatcher was a working class revolutionary. She believed that capitalism was in the interests of ordinary people, not the toffs. Many ordinary people agreed. And that is why the left hated her so much - Margaret Thatcher stole the working class. This feature-length film includes interviews with the Prime Minister, Norman Tebbit, Nigel Lawson, Cecil Parkinson, Neil Kinnock, Bernard Ingham and many others close to Mrs Thatcher.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Dp43BmbQ2KffT2VonQtOvUgHCx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margaret: Death of a Revolutionary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
