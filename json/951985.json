With a screenplay with no dialogues and without treatment, the actors improvised during the recording days. It was shot in the homes and workplaces of the actors, with sequence shots and handheld camera, and was edited by selecting fragments from different takes, in a sort of elliptical edition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7LzLrmri0sX3wj9kon0Cn0FWZUe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aficionados","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
