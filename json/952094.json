Life was simple, but not far from normal. Until a while ago, when Russian patrols started drawing the borderline and putting up barbed wire fences. In Churvaleti, the barbed wire fence goes right through the village. Families and communities got divided. Every other hour border patrols pass by and put anyone in captivity who come close to the fence. In spite of this menace, the villagers find ways to stay in touch with their relatives and friends across the line. Life goes on, but will it ever be the same again?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jW9FgQOjon44VMv0In5tV5Uqawv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Didn't Cross the Border: The Border Crossed Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
