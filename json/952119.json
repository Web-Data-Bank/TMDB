Their daughter, Elektra, lives for the day when her father's death will be avenged. Like a curse, the vendetta must be fulfilled, but is Elektra capable of committing the irreparable?  At Grand Théâtre de Genève, the cogs of revenge are set in motion by director Ulrich Rasche, who imprisons the characters of Elektra in a spectacular scenic device: a steel tower weighing almost twelve tons in perpetual rotation. In the pit, conductor Jonathan Nott and his Orchestre de la Suisse Romande confront the musical challenges of Strauss' intoxicating one-act score. The female characters at the centre of the drama are sung by three artists of the highest calibre: Ingela Brimberg as Elektra, Sara Jakubiak as Chrysothemis and Tanja Ariane Baumgartner as Clytemnestra.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/86RnHIhbQzAuK31EpAaycG8cPxf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elektra - Geneva","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
