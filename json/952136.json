The place has become a tourist's attraction: people come here to take a souvenire photo with the house, and sometimes with the master himself. The film, however, tells about the everyday life of a person who does what he loves, not paying attention to popularity, not seeking acclaim. It is a story about the harmony of solitude.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pgbzwRQFNyWsAU5fvDGrRWWVQ4T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
