His dream is to make it one day onto one of the lorries leading to the UK - and hopefully a better life. But despite a remarkable sense of community, the conditions in the jungle are harsh and taking its toll. Teefa has spent almost half a year in the camp and is tired of trying to cross, as only a few are lucky enough to succeed. After all jungles are evicted by the police in order to move the refugees to a new camp, Teefa starts to question the greatness of Britain and considers other options instead.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sNlMNHIcrLeOu8thfq3kvNipB5d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transit Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
