His life is indeed \"fish-a-holic\". Meebo stares at the fish, draws the fish and eat the fish every day. His father worries that he is a little different from other children but his mother always encourages and supports him warmly rather than worrying. After entering a high school, Meebo is still obsessed with the fish as usual. For some reason, Meebo is getting along with rogues like a protagonist of a tale. Eventually, Meebo starts to live alone. With encounters and re-encounters, he is still loved by the people around him and pushes forward straight to his only way.","popularity":3.169,"poster_path":"/oxoIcWj5lIDB7kgIsDj2PxiMxvu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12497,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tokyo Theatres Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":146106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Django Film","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fish Tale","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":7}
