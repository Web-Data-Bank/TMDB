Farewell to the native land, the primordial banks of the river and the people who have lived on the Hangar for centuries. History repeats itself. And again, as it was 40 years ago at the Bratskaya HPP, the life and fate of entire generations will be under the water of another man-made sea. We see all this through the eyes of three heroes - the writer Valentin Rasputin, the publisher Gennady Sapronov and the critic Valentin Kurbatov. The film was awarded the Award of the Academy of Russian Television TEFI-2011 in the categories \"Television documentary\" and \"Director of a television documentary / series\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"River of Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
