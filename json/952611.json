Having traveled from East to West, he became a famous writer in a country that is still considered the most reading. The concepts of Freedom and Creativity for him are not so much philosophical categories, but a credo of life. The genre of Sergei Miroshnichenko's new film can be defined as \"a lyrical post-Soviet comedy with a dramatic touch.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yuz, Jazz, Irka and the Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
