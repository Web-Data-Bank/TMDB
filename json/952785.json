Our position as a bridge between the East and the West is not only geographical, but also cultural; and this bridge has been a home for many great civilizations throughout the history. This rich cultural heritage and diversity is the foundation of Turkish modern and contemporary art. Approaching the western world with a more realistic perspective has turned the gaze of Turkish artists to their own land, history, people and tradition. Additionally, the personal statement tendencies of new generation artists have developed their own expression and communication methods instead of emulating the current art developments in the West.","popularity":0.643,"poster_path":"/poVtIdEUJ2hvVg0VxNjqnkTF9Qz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172123,"logo_path":"/focfWNY2gfVSvz7vJDabPCLGvVt.png","name":"Koskos Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crossroads","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
