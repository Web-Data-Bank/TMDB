In the depths of winter, the absence of heating quickly gave way to mutual aid and human warmth, suggesting that in Quebec, loneliness could be more dangerous than the cold. The film sketches the portrait of a woman and an old man whose precariousness usually remains invisible, but which the crisis situation reveals. Triangle of Darkness tells the story of how the woman tries to reproduce the human warmth that has so much marked the collective imagination of disaster victims.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zg9k9grKys5oyDF5DXMHOpXmDRh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triangle of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
