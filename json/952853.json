Luckily for her, the feeling's mutual! Although everything's been going great between them, there's still room to explore and have some fun. In fact, Ryan has an idea... You see, Ryan saw Laney's old babysitter, Kenna James, in passing and thinks it'd be fun to have her join them sometime. Nikole Nash and her stepsister Aften Opal are worried about getting in trouble with their stepmom, Katie Morgan, after accidentally breaking a vase she owns. However, when they discuss the possibility of Katie punishing them, Aften looks more dreamy than worried. Gianna Dior greets Hazel Grace, a friend who has arrived to spend the night. They are both 19 years old and haven't seen each other for a while. Gianna's stepmom Katie Morgan joins them in greeting Hazel as well and it immediately becomes apparent that Katie and Hazel have a crush on each other. It is obvious that Gianna is becoming stressed, leaving a certain unease.","popularity":0.689,"poster_path":"/boxOgBjN4HfhV07HFd8MO3hafv4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53532,"logo_path":"/1s5JV8QAG5zEkkHnGFiyZB9Kusi.png","name":"Girlsway Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spank Me Instead","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
