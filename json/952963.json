Perhaps, for the first time on our screen, doctors reflected on the value of human life, talked about their experiences caused by the death of a patient, about the imperfection of Soviet medicine, the lack of knowledge and responsibility of doctors. For forty years, medicine has made an incredible breakthrough, but the moral problems that plague doctors have remained the same. “You can’t get used to death” is the leitmotif of the paintings, old and new. The film was awarded as the Best Non-Fiction Film at the Russian Film Festival \"Window to Europe\" - 2016.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"\"The Heart\" 40 Years Later","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
