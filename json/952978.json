It would seem that everything has been known about these events for a long time. But only relatively recently, thanks to the research of the famous Russian historian William Pokhlebkin, we became aware of the details of a grandiose \"culinary\" action – a series of banquets that accompanied the negotiations of the allies in the devastated Crimea that difficult, still military winter. For obvious reasons, these feasts could not get into the field of view of the newsreelers of that time. But ... miraculously preserved materials give us the opportunity to feel their scale and specific atmosphere. No one says to see. And no one claims that the materials are documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1945 Menu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
