Попытка идентификации","overview":"At the turn of the millennium, Viktor Pelevin became perhaps the most fashionable, popular and commercially successful writer in Russia. At the same time, he does not appear in public, does not give interviews, wears dark glasses, and does not like to be recognized on the street. Who is this mysterious Mr. Pelevin? How did it happen that the most honorable title for a Russian writer – \"the ruler of thoughts\" - turned out to be applicable to him today? And how was he able to keep his \"incognito\" at the same time? All this is reflected in the film by people who knew our elusive hero well at different periods of his life – his classmates and teachers, friends of his youth and fellow writers, critics and publishers","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Writer \"P\".
