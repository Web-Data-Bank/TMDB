He made such masterpieces of English literature as George Orwell's 1984 and William Faulkner's The Light in August, Ken Kesey's Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Robert P. Warren's All the Royal Army available to the Russian reader... Everyone knows these novels in Russia. But few people guess about the existence of Golyshev. And he himself treats his profession calmly and matter-of-factly. As well as to yourself and to your life. His philosophy is simple, Tolstoyan: the philosophy of small deeds. And - as a result - the creation of a high culture. In a word, a simple translator from God.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vicissitudes of Translation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
