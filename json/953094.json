SOME MANIPULATIONS captures the confrontational light pieces of Jean Toche, an avant garde musical performance by Nam June Paik and cellist Charlotte Moorman, an actionist painting event by Steve Rose, and a classic Dada lecture/performance by Al Hansen. SOME MANIPULATIONS was premiered in December 1967 as one of the continuous loop elements in Jud Yalkut's DESTRUCT FILM environment, in which spectator/participants were obliged to walk, sit on, and dive into a floor covered with unrolled \"junk\" 16mm film in order to view the rotating slide and film projections. The film's inclusion represented an instance of ultimate feedback of events back into the space in which they had been presented.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/82hhwULKq9DiXq7sQhJr7LVleoA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Manipulations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
