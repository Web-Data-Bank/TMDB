Following the footsteps of Heraclitus over his quote that 'no man ever step in the same river,' Josef Koudelka revisits more than 200 Hellenistic and Roman ancient cities he photographed repeatedly over past 26 years. During this epic journey to Mediterranean regions, we witness the moments of joy, tenderness, and silence while focusing on Koudelka's both artistic and philosophical search for the 'maximum.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/txarbOQNncJuN5yveSaViAxVWla.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kozmo Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2022-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Koudelka: Crossing The Same River","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
