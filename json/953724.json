In Nébule's hands it becomes whatever he wills--a hoop to roll, a spring to jump on, a tight-rope, a dog, or a bird. The metamorphoses, played out against soft, pastel-coloured backgrounds, encompass all the world of a child's fears and fancies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yty7d20nWvBhKkxWwBwEWOUyG6s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1973-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nébule","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
