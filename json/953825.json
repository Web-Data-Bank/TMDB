How did it happen that we began to believe the faces from the TV more than the native people? Why did \"brothers forever\" suddenly become \"we will never be brothers\"? The heroes of the film are residents of Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kiev, Kharkiv, Slavyansk, Kherson and their relatives and friends from Moscow, Voronezh, Smolensk, Sevastopol and Khabarovsk. The end-to-end story of the film is a dialogue between the director and his cousin, who lives in Lviv and who, unlike the author of the film, categorically did not accept the \"revolution of dignity\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w9IboYr38Rcxo9OqfWeXS9pN6is.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2015-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Tricked Us All?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
