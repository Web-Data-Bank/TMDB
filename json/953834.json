Friends of the Family centres around a sister and brother who awaken each morning to a secure and comfortable environment where all their needs are taken care of. When plans to collect for UNICEF are discussed over breakfast, the boy questions the reasons for doing so. A sweep of the animator's brush sends the children into a world they have never before seen, a world without even the necessities of life. Through the experience, they realize the purpose of raising funds for foreign aid and at the same time learn how children can make a worthwhile contribution to their brothers and sisters around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fos26ME5IEwU69qNaRJdpwpPruo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":60403,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1982-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friends of the Family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
