(An example: “A house of steel / Among high mountains / Using candles / Inhabited by people who sleep almost all the time.”) This significant, jam-packed exhibition revives Knowles’s poem on an old-school dot-matrix printer, and includes related ephemera, including a film by Allan Kaprow. The show also highlights forebears of Knowles’s aleatory composition, with a never-completed book by Mallarmé whose pages could be reordered at will, as well as Marcel Broodthaer’s 1969 homage to it. There are also successors: Nicholas Knight’s intricate paintings of overlapping colored curves were generated by an algorithm, and Katarzyna Krakowiak’s audio piece remixes Knowles’s original poem into skittering musique concrète.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ld0CMbalWMk7vvlIwj7ytZebjV9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emily Harvey Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House of Dust","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
