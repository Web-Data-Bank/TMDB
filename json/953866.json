Doctors could not diagnose him in any way, and meanwhile he was getting worse and worse. But the unusual patient had no right to tell what happened to him. Mahmud Rafikov was not an employee of the special services or a classified scientist. He was a cinematographer, but his name was not indicated in the credits, his films were numbered, not named, and he himself was under a non-disclosure agreement for fifty years. He was the only one who participated in the filming when Yuri Gagarin landed, he was filming nuclear explosions at close range, and he was lucky enough to survive after the release of radioactive elements on a submarine. Korolev and Kurchatov admired his skill. At the age of ninety-one, this only eyewitness of the events remembers every little thing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Numbered","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
