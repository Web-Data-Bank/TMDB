The focus is on the musical preferences and political ideas of the conflict participants who lost their health and lives in the bloody FA-ANTIFA confrontation. It was a subcultural war, the main front of which was music. It was conducted by very similar young people who did not fit into the social structure of modern Russian society. Now they have matured, and the activity of street confrontation has decreased. The main feeling that the heroes of the film, named after the cult novel by Anthony Burgess and Stanley Kubrick's tape, indulge in is nostalgia, and after it comes a new understanding of the years experienced and an understanding of the enduring value of the main motor of conflict activity – youth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Key to the Clockwork Orange","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
