Ген","overview":"Each grain crop - wheat, rye, rice and corn - has been \"creating\" a special type of person for centuries. For example, rye formed the Slavic culture, wheat influenced the inhabitants of almost all of Central Europe and a significant part of Asia, corn formed the inhabitants from Mexico to Nicaragua, and rice - representatives of Japan, India and China. Today, genetic engineers are trying to create the bread of the future. It is likely that after some time we will have three-dimensional food printers in our kitchens that will be able to \"print\" buns, loaves or confectionery. However, scientists are convinced that only part of the components for the \"printer\" will be chemical, and the rest of the components will continue to be grown on earth. At the same time, some researchers believe that genetic engineering may turn out to be a \"Pandora's box\", while others are sure that they can no longer do without it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s2pYa3hXtEmZLNfumxG617WbHlo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bread.
