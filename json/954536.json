When Hitler's army begins mobilising its last troops, Walter and his friends are recruited to help defend a strategically important bridge near their town. What begins as a relatively minor operation quickly descends into a life or death battle in which the idealistic young men are confronted by the brutal reality of war. Despite Elfie's desperate attempts to stop her lover from taking part in a battle she can see is useless and unwinnable, Walter's pride and blind obedience to Hitler compel him and his friends to hold their position even as the last of their superiors concede defeat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8ozPXayadhtBvrRUupfkpSTrNy5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bridge (A Wolfgang Panzer Film)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
