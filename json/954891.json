The film fully reflects the director's intention of \"capturing the coolness of people working silently\". The story is a simple one, but the care with which the scenes of tea picking, tea making and workrooms are filmed creates a refreshing atmosphere that is unique to this film. In particular, the theme and subject matter are fused together in a scene in which the \"moment of sublimation\", which occurs when the body is continuously focused on one thing and the mind is emptied, is superimposed on the scenery outside the window where the protagonist looks out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/27UFWgMXWbmyCNOuKoPaopHaDBC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2nd May, Chawotsukuru","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
