The film is shot in a way that makes the serious look funny, and the supposedly uncool look stick to the film. The sense of humour is reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino, but the ending, in which three stories that were misaligned like the misplaced buttons come together, shows the high quality of the film as a storyteller.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z6d7y735ClGvTgGELjp6bV1Sadd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hokasanbon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
