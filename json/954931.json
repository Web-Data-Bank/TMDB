The film blends surfing footage with images of rock concerts in Golden Gate Park, yoga exercises and skiing with splashes of psychedelia thrown in. Fredâ€™s artistic sensibilities and intimate knowledge of surfing and the blossoming intellectual movement are brought together in somewhat of a period piece that does an excellent job of capturing the feeling of the time. Local Pedro Point surfer Dick Keating is featured in much of the surfing footage, where he captured performing innovative maneuvers that few have repeated since.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Environmental Experience","title":"The Natural Art","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
