Evald Hermaküla began his theatrical career as a young, angry genius working at the Vanemuine Theater, where he staged several legendary productions. The direction of Hermaküla was clear - away from the text and the rationality towards the subconscious. The film mixes theatrical and personal memories of the author with documentary archival material and Hermaküla's contemporary thoughts on theater, life and death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eV3GniFr0yMqVD83fepQoJCxCRu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ugri Film","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2022-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hermaküla: Lost Father","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
