Marija feels she doesn't deserve to be free, for Katica any change is very scary. Ana describes herself as a little lonely duckling that doesn't belong anywhere. She is the only Serbian in the group and the issue of nationality is still a burden that our protagonists feel. The fact that they were all raped by Serbian soldiers doesn't diminish the group's distrust towards Ana…Today, the discovery of who they could be without the trauma they're identified with, is changing their life and relations.","popularity":1.166,"poster_path":"/4JOF1Skbqnk8ZfL11WGKJQ6uUwv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metar 60","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":20915,"logo_path":"/g0ZgDi0m0RubOnoUFYaHsa8M5To.png","name":"Hrvatska Radiotelevizija","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2022-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bigger Than Trauma","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
