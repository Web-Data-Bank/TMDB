It is also quite unusual to have a heroine who does not laugh at all, but she responds well to the demands, which must have been mentally and physically demanding. There is no spectacular action, but rather the endurance-style escapades convey the seriousness of life. The opening episode, in which Kay discovers that her lover is cheating on her, is a fairly well put-together romantic drama, although it is often forgotten because the second half of the film is entirely an escapade. Note that the director's name, the Yokogawa brothers, refers to one person, not several.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zWTAKC7aLZeVQRMbINr868G1Die.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sissou-1998","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
