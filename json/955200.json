The action scenes are so powerful and full of no-frills action that you'd think a major Japanese film would go as far as this. The director's spirit of wanting to do all kinds of things and his entertaining nature carry the film through to the end without stalling. The film's lovable momentum also covers up for some of the story's lapses. Incidentally, the pro-golfer Toraki of the title is a character who appears in only one scene and has nothing to do with the story or theme.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cXZlOG83MV9SK5jLTqR3SAkS5cy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Professional Golfer Toraki","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
