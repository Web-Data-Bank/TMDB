July, 2001: friends wave as a cruise ship departs Lisbon for Mediterranean ports and the Indian Ocean. On board and on day trips in Marseilles, Pompeii, Athens, Istanbul, and Cairo, a professor tells her young daughter about myth, history, religion, and wars. Men approach her; she's cool, on her way to her husband in Bombay. After Cairo, for two evenings divided by a stop in Aden, the captain charms three successful, famous (and childless) women, who talk with wit and intellect, each understanding the others' native tongue, a European union. The captain asks mother and child to join them. He gives the girl a gift. Helena sings. Life can be sweet.","popularity":2.254,"poster_path":"/kVEWev0owMP6IYV1Y1wjyv0CkZH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madragoa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":11912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mikado Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Talking Picture","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":29}
