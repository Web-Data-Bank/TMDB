Narrated by Conroy Chino of the Acoma Pueblo, Looking Toward Home explores how government relocation programs in the 1950s enticed significant numbers of Native Americans to leave the reservation for life in major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The story is told through their eyes and of subsequent generations as they maintain their tribal identity far away from the culturally nurturing climate of the reservation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking Toward Home: An Urban Indian Experience","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
