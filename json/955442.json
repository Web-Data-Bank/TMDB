The film shows an emergence of the Pink Fairy. Part femme, part tomboy, part fairy, the characters come together to subvert the idea of a fixed identity. Luminscent imagery is imprinted by hand using hand-processed colour footage, optically printing super8 to 16mm, 16mm to 16mm, negative to positive, video to film, and repeating motifs, to explore the intricacies of the celluloid medium. Audio emotes through random manipulations in a Brion Gysin-like cut-up technique.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iL28dnUDs4a8NF9UQnIwgKPI1x2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pink Fairy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
