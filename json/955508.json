The purpose of realizing this project is to reveal the wrong or incompletely known “firsts”. Based on the documents produced by cinema historians, one of the main goals was to scan the newspapers and magazines of the period from some missing parts to the whole, or to clarify some of the discussed issues. From the first screening venue to the first women on the silver screen and the stage, from the first color film to the first films that were screened, this documentary takes a journey from stop to stop, like a reference to the trains of the Lumières, which is made with an academic point of view, revealing the \"true or incompletely known mistakes\" with documents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3y8iEc92sPIa0Nk8F1oXfbmmunR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maltepe Üniversitesi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2021-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watching The Shadow | Controversial Firsts In Turkish Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
