The world after the atomic disaster. People are afraid of civilization, which, in their opinion, will surely lead to an atomic explosion again. So they destroy the last car, the last plane, burn the last book. They prepare to destroy the last scenic masterpiece. And only teenage Tom can't desecrate Leonardo da Vinci's beautiful creation. The crowd tears the painting apart, and the boy carries away in his fist a scrap of ruined canvas. In his hole, he gingerly unclenches his fingers - the smile of Gioconda shines in the palm of his hand. The boy sleeps, curled up like an embryo in the white space of the frame, and with him faith is born again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6YW4mzJmzrSJRQnCqDfW5Z12fr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
