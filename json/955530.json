Due to their child-like small vocabulary, today's young people seem to have poor communication from an adult's perspective. However, they know how to feel happiness in their ordinary daily lives and how to share it. The film depicts the theme that happiness is not something to be searched for, but something to be felt, in a soft narrative like a girls' manga, within the three days of four women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kJjxdlL0hQrtq6g71Qhg0JHaCMJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ウワバミの絵","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
