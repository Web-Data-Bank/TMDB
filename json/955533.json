The languour and excitement that one feels only in summer, are symbolised by the clouds that disappear so bravely and so fleetingly. The boredom and freedom that one feels only at certain times of life. The strength and vulnerability to the loneliness that only girls feel. The film succeeds in visualising these uncertain and subtle moods in a delicate way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dU73AAywxDwUaJUvtLWzCHq7Oya.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"夏将軍","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
