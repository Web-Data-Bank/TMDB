Daisuke Fukuhara, who plays Fukuhara, gives a particularly good, natural performance as a man who is completely off his rocker. There is also a distinctive sense of rhythm in the time-lapse explanations that connect the short shots, making this film unique in that it is somehow stylish and at the same time funny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/LvNxTJfT6JbBYTIh1cJm4zLnm3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"バッド デット","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
