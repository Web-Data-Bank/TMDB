A girl cannot accept the death of her lover. An angel is right next to these people who are struggling to survive, almost crushed by a love that has nowhere to go. A plastic bottle delivery man. A guide to the passage between this world and the next. A rebirth witness. And a folk duo called the Vaudeville Duo. They deliver their miracles as unobtrusively, as small and shiny as a grain of light in the midwinter wind. What miracles are performed by angels in human form, riding around on bicycles, holding fishing rods or endlessly shirking?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Geq6y47mAKQKWU04LnNyCBXBI2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welome, Back, Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
