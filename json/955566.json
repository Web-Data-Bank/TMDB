Shadowboxing, strengthening his abdominal muscles with equipment bought by mail order, repetitive lateral jumps... Is he a young man who wants to be a boxer? No, he has no intention of becoming a professional boxer or a macho man. He has only one goal: to rob the bride at the forthcoming wedding of his girlfriend, who three years ago went to the dump in her own jeans and never came back. Since the day he received her invitation to the wedding, he has been steadily preparing himself to direct and star in the best bride-stealing act of his life. He had to build up his body, decide on the route, check his movements, practise his lines, arrange a black Porsche, a white tuxedo and some cool shoes... The plan was complete and the day of the ceremony finally arrived. He leaves the house with a bat in his bouquet. Cool, man. But will the plan work?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2Sq2R8tM7049cIAxKlFdFGBe4Vk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wanigawa Boots","origin_country":""},{"id":172430,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nagoya Visual Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mukade Rodeo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
