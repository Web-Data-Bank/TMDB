This episode is about the four pilgrims who are led into a high-key sunbeam. The drones and Mevrevic riff in three different folk flutes (Quena, Shinobue, Suling) are intoxicated under the interference of the fluorescences, still, the four continue with their pilgrimage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zEjD1MszwPSHcBTLsrdqDvo9UR4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mystic Tube #2: Number of Fluorescents","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
