Is this choice really compatible with the ecological transition? Although nuclear power plants do not emit CO2, their dismantling at the end of their life generates pollution of another kind: exponential quantities of contaminated waste, the reuse of which remains hypothetical and the storage of which is highly problematic. Not to mention the risk of disaster, as at Chernobyl or Fukushima.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8KZKv9GCdUc3kzRWTwv9KXVkFYW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":""},{"id":16266,"logo_path":"/4BqNNUJgq1wojHPDgL90oL4LW58.png","name":"Seppia","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":90881,"logo_path":"/sRtQRyhTAPzsw0wUmnrpkXPQEuz.png","name":"Public Sénat","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nucléaire : Une solution pour la planète ?","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
