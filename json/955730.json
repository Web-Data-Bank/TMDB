Stylistically, Hubbard powerfully departs from the small film gauge formats that dominate his documentary work, instead utilizing widescreen Cinemascope that serves to illuminate the enormous scale of loss for each individual that has perished. Through the artful juxtaposition of universal imagery of death and ritual, deliberate close-ups of a human skull to the scattering of ashes, Hubbard’s dream-like elegy transports the viewer to a deep, universal state-of-consciousness that anyone that has lost a loved one will instantly recognize. The resulting depth of emotion and empathy serves as both a mournful prayer and an indelible filmic monument to the dead.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memento Mori","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
