Children like Bawer and Hebûn, who were part of the distribution group, would secretly collect these newspapers from outside the city at a previously agreed location and take them to the planned meeting place in the city. There, the children changed their clothes and went out to distribute them, under the guise of other work. But they were constantly followed by those who saw the newspaper as dangerous and wanted to prevent its dissemination. Çerx is a testament to the conditions under which these newspapers were distributed to readers and the difficulties encountered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2B64sD6YLUmzzkqGozGTAqU2Sfp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mesopotamia Cinema Collective","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Çerx is a testament to the conditions under which these newspapers were distributed to readers and the difficulties encountered.","title":"Çerx","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
