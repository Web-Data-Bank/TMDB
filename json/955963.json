Masha arrives at the quarry with a heavy heart, burdened by a secret she hasn’t told anyone about. She wants to speak with her mother, Vera, but she has struggles of her own. A young woman finds herself in a deafening masculine environment where no one's listening. A journey to save herself quickly blurs into a venture to save her own mother. Ants crawling on the walls of the house, childhood photos and Russian food, are the harsh reality of one woman, and a comforting memory for the other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1pcPkOrFdrqclx0Njsir71eTSTb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motherland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
