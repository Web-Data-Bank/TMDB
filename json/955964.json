In 1979, to thank the owner of the island of Logoden for authorising the filming of scenes for Mon Oncle d’Amérique, Alain Resnais offered this gentleman, Jean Fraysse, a highquality super 8 camera. From then on, Jean Fraysse became passionate about it and roamed the island with camera in hand, recording images of nature and his few loved ones. What is more, he recorded sounds: worknoises, sounds of nature, family conversations. He later gave it all to the Cinémathèque of Brittany. It was there that a young intern named Aurélie Bonamy discovered this discrete, forgotten treasure. Of her own accord she decided to organise the few shots, to number the sounds and edit and mix them separately in a series of vignettes. -- Jean-Pierre REHM","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xXPhyiMIDO4x7Beoelb9wjISNG1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Logoden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
