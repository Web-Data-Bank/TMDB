The play opens with a familiar Beckettian theme, the search to put an end to language: “—story . . . if you could finish it . . . you could rest . . . sleep . . . not before”. “The shape of the narrative itself is indicative of the mind already in the process of degenerating towards an impasse. Voice alternates between talking about the story-telling itself, or the need to find the story to end all stories, and narrating [what it hopes will be that final] story.\" (Wiki)  The term ‘cascando’ (‘cascades’) involves the decrease of volume and the deceleration of tempo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lX07BzTg9oR7iYQy24DwHKDl0n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cascando","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
