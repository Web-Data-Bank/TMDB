She leaves with two first prizes in comedy. In the theater she triumphed in \"The Typewriter\" by Jean Cocteau. It was Cocteau who made her cut her hair to adopt his famous short cut. The cinema opened its doors and she turned with Pierre Fresnay, then with Jean Gabin, in \"Le rouge est mis\" by Gilles Grangier. The Comédie-Française then asked her to make a choice. It would be the cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x7uIc85rR8KmCoQxzbpoUcoFVkH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78594,"logo_path":"/nbvR0hoJUXmG0t58vGpHiDEJVYg.png","name":"Flair Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10611,"logo_path":"/zQ4fGaEnNkWfSzyygXRcUZwPmDG.png","name":"Ciné+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annie Girardot selon son coeur","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
