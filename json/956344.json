During the early years of Tibetans' life in exile in India, many of them had a hard time fighting poverty and other related issues. Me-tse is the story of one such family, Jamyang's â€” with his wife Dolma and two sons Londhen and Gonpo. Jamyang runs a noodle factory partially owned by his colleague Phuntsok. The money he makes out of this business is so meagre that it is sufficient only for daily living expenses. He works extra hours to earn more and save for his sons' future. Londhen, the elder son, is not so bright in studies. He discontinues his studies and joins a tailoring institute with the help of Jamyang's financial assistance. The younger son Gonpo is good at his studies so he gets a place in an engineering college. The remaining story deals with how the future of the two sons develops, and how they handle the responsibility of taking care of their old father.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
