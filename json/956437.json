We discover the \"Kin\" of night clubs, high buildings, bicycle-taxis, shoe shiners and hairdressers, the \"Kin\" of poor neighborhoods, but, above all, the \"Kin\" of music, where all the genres rub elbows, from beer party brass bands to the rumba to traditional dances, without leaving out the in-fashion bands of the time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kin Kiesse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
