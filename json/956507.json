After a lifetime of enduring mostly clinical forms of touch, she yearns for her first gratifying sexual experience. With the support of her friends, caregivers and a Dutch organization that connects disabled people to sex care workers, she builds the confidence needed to prioritize this aspect of her well-being at last. Offering a lens through which we can examine intersections of sexuality, disability and gender, Sexual Healing is an introspective conversation-starter that brings much-needed illumination to an experience that is too often left out of social discourse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4F9VB8gPfqRE35GsIORDFIDL5J8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72500,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tangerine Tree","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sexual Healing","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
