The students find friendship, romantic love, heartbreak and most importantly, kindness for themselves in their mistakes and first-time experiences. Living on their own, without parents or the comforts of home, they learn intensively and develop self-esteem, confidence and coping mechanisms as a group. Together, they foster the ability to be completely and unselfconsciously themselves in the company of others, which creates a climate of acceptance and self-love so strong that, when the COVID-19 pandemic sends everyone home early, the kids can rely on it remotely.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":372,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absolute Beginners","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
