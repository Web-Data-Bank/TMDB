She often leaves him waiting outside like a dog when she does business. While she sees a notary about an inheritance, he's seduced to a bar by a shady man. The rogue gets Fernand drunk, knocks him out and switches costumes and papers. He's now Robert Durand, a voluntary Foreign legion recruit. After failed attempts to explain, he tastes military life and finds it less disciplined and more enjoyable then, marriage. But will that last when his wife tracks him and his unit is sent to action in tribal Algeria?","popularity":1.151,"poster_path":"/ai6VnTAbEkUOVZ8IOXe0obuRdRJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Calamy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1936-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One of the Legion","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
