This production was adapted for the screen by Trevor Nunn and Yves Baigneres.  It was directed by Nunn and is based on his staging of the original Glyndebourne Festival production in 1986/87, which was remounted at Covent Garden in the autuum of 1992 with most of the original cast.  Immediately after that performance, the production was moved to the giant stage at Shepperton Studios, with much expanded sets and lighting. It was then recorded using EMI's original award-winning soundtrack.  First performed in 1935, and based on the play 'Porgy' by DuBose and Dorothy K. Heyward, Porgy and Bess has achieved worldwide renown through such memorable songs as 'Summertime', 'It ain't necessarily so', 'I got plenty o' nothin\", 'Oh Lawd, I'm on my way' and many more, set to Gershwin's moving symphonic score.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/essWmkTxcIzm2HWMze47kjWOf2k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":183,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gershwins' Porgy & Bess","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
