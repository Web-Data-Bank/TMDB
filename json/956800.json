But instead of marching through the streets, they take a different approach. Race2Dinner was born, an afternoon of wining, dining and honest conversations about white supremacy and unconscious biases that white women live by. Navigating everyday privileges and cultural differences, the bold intervention changes minds and opens eyes for some, while others turn away because it is too hard. Everything is on the table to eat and unpack, but there is only one rule: no crying at the dinner table.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Zl3gLlKE6UMzz8iZwt7tCcAzLi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deconstructing Karen","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
