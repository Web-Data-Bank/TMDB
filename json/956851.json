Each elder remembers their own family's ajaja songs and explains how they were created by poets taking their words from their life experiences. The video, translated and subtitled for the first time, includes priceless footage of these elders singing and drumming the songs, and their playfully combative and humorous interactions are a joy to watch. The process also allowed Isuma to publish a full CD of the selected songs and to use and preserve many of them in Isuma's films over the next 25 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Messages from the Past","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
