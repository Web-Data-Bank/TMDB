Using a striking visual style, director Francois Girard ('The Red Violin' and 'Thirty-Two Short Films about Glenn Gould') places Yo-Yo Ma within a series of computer-generated, three-dimensional recreations of Piranesi's well-known prison etchings.  Through Yo-Yo Ma's and music producer Steven Epstein's struggle to recreate and interact with the imaginary space that Ma performs in, the film examines the complexity of illusion, of representation and reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pEYY8GzwZbYDlvXwzf1kYaN3wKl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bach Cello Suite #2: The Sound of the Carceri","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
