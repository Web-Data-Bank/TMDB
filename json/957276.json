Filmed almost entirely in black-and-white, this observational documentary gently explores a community of tyre cutters and recyclers, young and old, male and female, as they create with their super-sharp blades, careful eyes and skilful strokes, buckets, brushes and slippers from discarded rubber tyres. And, from time to time, in fleeting yet visceral moments in between their movements, snatched conversation and song, something lyrical, even philosophical emerges, and we are gently reminded of how every death gives way to a birth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tyres","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
