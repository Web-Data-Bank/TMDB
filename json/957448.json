They are sent back to the Wild West (19th century), Prehistoric times (50,000 BC), Medieval Times (12th century), the Caribbean Pirates era (17th century), WW2 Prisoner of War Camps (1940s); and sent forward in time to a Parallel Universe, where all the inhabitants are colored (blue, red, green, yellow, pink and purple faced). But there's a twist - each theater actor must complete three individual quests, before sunset. Those who fail will be marooned in that time and place forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to the Present!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
