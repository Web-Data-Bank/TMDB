Last year I ventured out, found a suitable spot, chopped down and dragged the necessary trees and shaped them into a four wall log cabin.  This year I build the log structure for the roof, lay the complete roof and floor, build an underground root cellar under the log cabin for food storage and prepping and much more.  I am now 21 and have built this log cabin from the materials i could find in my own forest in Sweden with only the simple hand tools I could carry in my backpack. Just like our Forefathers did. I had no previous experience in building, gathering materials or even filming. So I started studying the old arts myself and learning from my grandfather and mentor Ã…ke Nilsson. I filmed everything myself using a tripod and edited this video so you can follow my journey and hopefully learn as I do.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 Years Alone | Building Log Cabin Like Our Forefathers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
