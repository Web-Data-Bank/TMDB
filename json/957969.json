Qu'il fait bon chez nous","overview":"Life could be so sweet for Gus Vermeulen and Achille Mironval. They are partners in a cheese trade and business is good. So what they plan to do is to marry their two children so as to perpetuate this blissful situation. However two annoying facts cast a shadow over their happiness. Jean-Pierre Mironval, Achille's son, won't hear of anything connected with cheese and would rather be a jazz band leader and Gus, with his passion for spiritism, sows the seeds of discord between the two men. But all is well that ends well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":55120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ah!
