As such, he cannot paint from television, photos, scans, the Internet - only \"exclusively from nature\". That is why most of Latawczyc's money is spent on models. An additional circumstance is that Zygmunt - \"never dreams of anything\".  When Zygmunt meets the beautiful model Zuzanna, he quickly comes to the conclusion that he should necessarily paint her with a parrot on his shoulder. The parrot (Ara Ararauna) selected for this purpose costs PLN 6,000.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kobieta z papugą na ramieniu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
