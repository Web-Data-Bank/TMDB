Because of the geopolitical interests of some countries and the indifference of other nations, international justice refuses to prosecute the regime of Bashar Al Assad responsible for crimes reminiscent of Nazi or Khmer barbarism. Filmed throughout Europe over nearly four years between 2016 and 2020, the film recounts the behind-the-scenes and twists and turns of investigations and proceedings that will lead to the issuance of arrest warrants for the highest officials of Bashar al Assad's administration for crimes against humanity.","popularity":1.255,"poster_path":"/zGM0XjB83T2jvUHBUPwajN9udxh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'ici","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":68446,"logo_path":"/9GiI34u4iJu9gOYD28RRLgm51vf.png","name":"Katuh Studio","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":122128,"logo_path":"/iYPn1TwMpJXPRTF9O0m4h0nEmCS.png","name":"Special Touch Studios","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":20662,"logo_path":"/rxfxm2P7zJdUsXB9d5Zrg9DOXfd.png","name":"TV5 Monde","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Souls of Syria","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
