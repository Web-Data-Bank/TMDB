They crisscross the villages of southern Morocco in their old car and share double rooms in shabby hotels. They are exactly the same size, and wear the same suits and ties, as well as the same shoes. Paid nearly nothing, they try to play hard to make good figures. One day, in a gas station planted in the middle of the desert, a motorcycle parks in front of them.  A man is handcuffed to the luggage rack, threatening. It’s the Evader. Their meeting marks the beginning of an unforeseen and mystical journey.","popularity":4.32,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79322,"logo_path":"/txqLPA3VSO3PSKFB5Otp9kroHGd.png","name":"Barney Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":123519,"logo_path":"/tU4qFvmGQDyvAvr0YPSnZiqewhP.png","name":"Mont Fleuri Production","origin_country":"MA"},{"id":3984,"logo_path":"/pvOBu9K0zTRuwJW7WII34x17kdz.png","name":"Entre Chien et Loup","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":22028,"logo_path":"/sL5udH4n7YbCuHJ4XxUyliWTJw9.png","name":"NiKo Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2023-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Déserts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
