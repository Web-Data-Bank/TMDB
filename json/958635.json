Together, they explore pine forests, contemplate the shape of clouds, follow teenagers and crash their parties, and secretly watch horror films. But this one summer is special for Dune – last year, the family skipped their usual holiday without her knowing why. She feels that something has changed. As childhood becomes a little more distant, she begins to see adults and teenagers differently and understand their secrets.","popularity":2.804,"poster_path":"/5Hk4dsEw19QaGiII6uHKiJQ3lCH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120768,"logo_path":"/Ahlr3VFUn3H44bmgovam0hyglds.png","name":"Trésor Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This One Summer","video":false,"vote_average":4.929,"vote_count":14}
