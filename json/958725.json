The imagery and music evoke the habitat and song of these nocturnal birds. Filmed in black and white, symbolic of the cycle of life and death, the owl is a harbinger of transformation, mediating between two worlds – the seen and the unseen, the physical and the spiritual. From the terror of night, the forest opens to grassland and we hear in the music, the transcendent song of the lark.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catalogue of Birds: Book 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
