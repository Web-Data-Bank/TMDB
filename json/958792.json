These men were serial abusers, getting away with it in plain sight. With contributions from those who suffered at the hands of these predatory men, this documentary reveals how this was allowed to happen. Did entertainment bosses turn a blind eye to the offences? Were the authorities slow to react? And did the Britain of the time dismiss anyone who dared to 'speak out'?","popularity":1.845,"poster_path":"/zUZJsJfDMLqIy5HrpdfdZUxwUrA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27856,"logo_path":"/jLMbth7gIW0UMxGqHB5zuHk1iJk.png","name":"Channel 5","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Treasure, National Disgrace: Savill, Harris & Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
