He is a 27-year-old curly-haired, weak and nonchalant young man who struggles to become an adult. He still lives with his mother, Giselle, in a poor neighborhood. After the closing of the last synagogue, it is the turn of the last kosher grocery store to close its doors. That's it, they are the last Jewish family in the area. But much to Giselle's dismay, Bellisha doesn't particularly want to leave. He feels comfortable and positive, despite the tensions in the community and his mother's rapidly deteriorating health.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":58566,"logo_path":"/juP3WP22UOLnkCmF0euWVDtcjME.png","name":"Moonshaker","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Le dernier des Juifs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
