One day his dead body is found by the Police. Sukhchen comes to know that another police officer, Sheva Singh, and Balwant are the culprits, and he sets out to expose them. Shortly thereafter the Police raid their house, find unauthorized weapons, arrest Sukhchen, hold him in a cell, and torture him. Harnek's widow approaches DIG Vijay Tandon and pleads with him. Before Vijay could intervene, Sukhchen escapes, and joins a gang of bandits, not realizing that soon the remainder of his family will become easy targets of not Balwant's goons, the police, but the local community itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1yojZl7uuYg1lgzhmc6sqkpGffH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tabaahi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
