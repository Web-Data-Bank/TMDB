The film traces the evolution of the “hillbilly” image through Hollywood films, network news and entertainment shows, dramatic renderings of popular literature, and interviews with contemporary Appalachians to demonstrate how stereotypes are created, reinforced, and often used to rationalize exploitation. Strangers and Kin suggests how a people can embrace modernity without becoming “strangers to their kin.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2vEyik5rZxfuQKqgRk70Jcx7X9x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strangers and Kin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
