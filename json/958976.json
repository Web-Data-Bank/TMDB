Its followers cherish its traditional practices and its sense of everlasting values in a changing world. In the Good Old Fashioned Way documents a riverside baptism, foot-washing ceremonies, an Association Meeting, the music of the church, and memorial services held at a family ceremony. Widespread only among mountain people, this religion is uniquely a product of Appalachian culture â€” and this documentary is a rare look at its practices.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Good Old Fashioned Way","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
