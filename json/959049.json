She is faced with memories where her mother, who is not there now, has always been there. It is possible to banish these memories only up to a certain point. A lyrical film about the strong feeling that seemingly insignificant objects from childhood evoke in us. That, despite the loss of people who once filled our whole world with themselves, despite the passage of time and our rejection of memories, saving us from the pain of loss, we cannot resist this feeling. Once out of control, it plunges us into childhood and reconnects with relatives who are no longer around. Everything continues as we continue, parental love and the music of our childhood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meeting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
