After months of vicious fighting, Allied forces surrendered on the island only to be met with a brutal march to P.O.W. camps dotted across the islands. Thousands died on the marches, before reaching the P.O.W. camps where countless more died. The surrender of the Philippines, now almost forgotten in U.S. history, is commemorated in the Philippines every year.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/84lSyJTDmufGfxoF1tWOSuQSxnx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What was once an island paradise became Hell.","title":"Bataan Death March","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
