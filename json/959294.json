He closes his eyes. He and all the clothes around him soar into the air. The \"free fall\" into memory begins. Clothes rush up, and Maxim himself begins to smile with his eyes closed. All the prickly needles begin to fly off him up - he becomes an ordinary boy again. Everyone needs their own approach. And especially for children with a difficult history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
