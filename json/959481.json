The video, however, does not preoccupy itself with “animal sex”, but with mankind’s in a general sense erotic relationship to animals, which appears to play a considerable motivating part in such prohibitions. The found footage and still images, of which the video consists, shows the animal as it is: seen at second hand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eqH6prA4NxNcU38ZvuBUI1UAp7a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unnatural and Unsocialdemocratic Vice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
