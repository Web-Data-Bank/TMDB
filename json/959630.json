As one family packs snacks and makes signs, an older sibling shares the importance of the march with the newest member of the family. Reflecting on the day, the siblings agree that the best thing about Pride is getting to be yourself. This joyful homage to a day of community and inclusion-and to the joys of anticipation-is also a comprehensive history.
