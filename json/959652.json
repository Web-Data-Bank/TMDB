I have to say what I think.\" George Edelstein has always adhered to this principle: both in his former secular life and during his years of church service. A man of an amazing fate, complex as the century in which he had to live. Not a Soviet person in Soviet society. A connoisseur of freedom, who does not like being called a dissident. A village priest, to whom Ronald Reagan returned the parish, and whose son became an Israeli politician. A man who always spoke the truth – about the state that persecuted for the faith, and about the church hierarchs who participated in it. \"My duty is not to be silent. In silence, I am convinced, God is surrendered.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Duty is Not to Be Silent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
