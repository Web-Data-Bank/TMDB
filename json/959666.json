That was supposed to be between US!\" she exclaims. Alexis takes a deep breath and then puts on a small smile. It's fine, Cori, she says, she was overreacting. She's relieved to see that her friend isn't mad at her anymore. As she walks away, Alexis' expression darkens and over seconds turns into full-on disturbed rage - she is quietly seething and hyperventilating as she pulls at her hair.  A teen girl, Carmen (Ember Snow), is crying when Brett (Johnny Goodluck), her boyfriend's brother, returns home. Brett seems to take an interest in her, almost like a predator sniffing out prey, as he sees how vulnerable she looks. He learns that Carmen and his brother got into a huge fight about her jealousy and insecurity towards other girls.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye For An Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
