Flickering sunlight. Fast forward. B4 it was seeing faint movement on the distant horizon. Now the skill is to see the rush from the passing car. We are on the run. Visual experiences that cement out daily lives, with an increasing uneasy disjointedness. Images like afterthoughts. Flows. Standing waves. Kill kill the eye. Fade the past. Fun the film like water through the eye. Rush ruse use muse. The language of the flash now. Curtains twisting and folding. Images tying around each other: distant memory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t5MaPRGU31iM8wZecDxhRCcyiDg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knots","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
