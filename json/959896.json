In addition to the string of masterpieces he made with the Swedish auteur, von Sydow embodied a wide range of characters in films by art-house titans such as Jan Troell, Lars von Trier, and Wim Wenders, leaving behind a body of work that spans more than six decades and a dozen different countries.\r He appeared in more than one hundred and fifty films and television series in multiple languages. Max von Sydow received his French citizenship in 2002 and lived in France for the last two decades of his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/98EMR32OZOJboXbfIfalaQFp3RP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85575,"logo_path":"/ylgVrMSjD8vCPXuzkLeDfipmE2b.png","name":"Sky Arts","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max von Sydow","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
