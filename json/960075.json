In White America. Kaukauna & King 50 Years Later","overview":"Joanne Williams' documentary captures an experiment of sorts. In 1966, amid the Civil Rights era, students from Milwaukee's Rufus King High School and students from Kaukauna High School participated in an exchange program that culminated in a production of Martin Duberman's play IN WHITE  AMERICA. Now, over fifty years later, the original participants come together with a new generation, reprising this play with reflection and new energy amid our own racial reckoning.","popularity":0.638,"poster_path":"/nS9Ok1la3bau0BjyVwPpNoUsoxC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174367,"logo_path":null,"name":"C-Bird Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Exchange.
