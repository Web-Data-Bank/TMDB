It was commissione by Du Pont to explain its security plan to company employees. The story revolves around Sir Evans, a knight of old, who goes forth to battle the menacing dragons. Only through the protection of armor made for him by his trusty squire, D.I.R.P. can he slay the dragons without being singed by their fiery blasts. But knights in legends aren't the only ones to fear dragons. Most of us, like Ed Blevins, hero of this tale, have the modern-day dragons of insecurity to reckon with. But Ed, like Sir Evans, also has the protection of D.I.R.P., in this case the Du Pont Industrial Relations Plans, which are outstanding examples of how a company helps its employees help themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uWBHLLCTYfzCJTyVdg0Jxzndyba.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13410,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Sutherland Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":173051,"logo_path":null,"name":"E.
