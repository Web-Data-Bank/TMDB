While mostly shot in Montana, the crew also filmed in Utah, California, Washington, South Dakota, Alaska, Wyoming and Whistler, B.C. Set Your Sights features Shay Lee, Karl Fostvedt, Sandy Boville, Finn Anderson, Dash Kamp, Luke Tanaka, Mack Jones, Pat Cowan, Brock Paddock, Josh Anderson, Cody Perin, Austin Torvinen, Noah Wallace, Pete Arneson, Jake Doan, Sam Hurst, David Steele, John Kutcher and more.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":173055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toy Soldier Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Toy Soldier Productions spent the 2010/2011 winter exploring the Northwestern United States with some of the best up-and-coming talent in the ski & snowboard world.","title":"Set Your Sights","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
