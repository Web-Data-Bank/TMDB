He is not like other ordinary patients as he is obsessed with a desire to commit suicide. It is quite easy to understand: his life is terrible, he has debts, mother-in-law, his wife is no angel, work, etc. In general, he is pushed to the limit, or rather, to hanging himself. And even in despair as he is, he fails in attempts to part this life. He tries to take pills, but they are not poisonous, then the floor is not high enough, then the chandelier falls down. In the last attempt, Pavel Surkov gets to the hospital to a surgeon, who puts him in a separate ward. In the morning, a woman appears at his bedside, while he is drugged with Phenazepam.","popularity":0.613,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Apostle Herman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
