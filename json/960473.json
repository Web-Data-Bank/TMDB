Archive scenes capture the true essence of the GWR with its Brunellian stations and station platforms, engines, lines, freight yards and engine sheds. We can enjoy magnificent engines including some of the Castle and King Class that were turned out at Swindon. These include the 4079 Pendennis Castle, 5029 Nunney Castle, 7020 Gloucester Castle, 6000 King George V, 6024 King Edward I and others that have since ended up at the cutters. We also see engines that have been used on these lines of late including the Eurostar, Intercity 125s, the high speed trains on the Heathrow Express Service, ARC stone trains as well as single, two-and three-car units. And our look at the GWR wouldn t be complete without a visit to preserved lines including the Taff Valley Railway and the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gYardEaoquLp7H8SLzHCcSrCXZK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britain's Railways Then & Now: GWR","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
