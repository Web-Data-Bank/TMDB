Lyndon looked to the pre-commercialised origins of the race where competitors set off with very little assistance or hope of reaching the finish line. To this day, even though the Dakar Rally has outgrown itâ€™s humble origins, it still retains the Malle Moto class for those who seek a pure test of spirit and endurance. One man. One bike. One box of tools. 12 days and 10,000 kilometers of hard racing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nk7Gw6Zi30YE9WHgNBk99rI8BcW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adventure Spec","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malle Moto - The Forgotten Dakar Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
