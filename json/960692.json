I made this film at renowned experimental filmmaker Phil Hoffman's Film Farm workshop in Mount Forest, Ontario. Originally, I wanted to create a simple statement about overcoming depression. The ultra short narrative in 'Sisyphus' uses heartbreak as a metaphor for depression, since depression is just that - being heartbroken about life. The creative process and the practice of handmaking films speaks to treating life as a work in progress, thereby positively embracing the permanence of Sisyphus in my life. The lush, organic imagery in 'Sisyphus' was created by hand-processing 16mm black and white footage in a bucket and hand-tinting and toning individual pieces of film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bo5xYASZpfytgVn3GDwvJrlAZ90.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"sisyphus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
