Debbie, a Chinese American filmmaker, documents and narrates with skepticism and humor, from the early stages of Steven’s search, through the moment Sandy steps foot in California for the first time, to a year into their precarious union. Global migration, Sino-American relations and the perennial battle of the sexes, weigh in on the fate of their marriage in this intimate and quirky personal documentary.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/zky9J7db5qp7tF5dw0YJLF3Ztjq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seeking Asian Female","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
