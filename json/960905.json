Her journey takes us inside a dungeon, onto a pole-dancing stage, behind the scenes at a sex-toy shop, and inside the very real world of VR sex. We meet a gigolo, brothel owners and sex workers. Insights from Tantric and other sex therapists power Julia’s journey through sexual satisfaction towards a conclusion: that if we talk about it more, and are more positive about its role and our participation in it, life will be better — both in and beyond the bedroom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uqhU28r0UKwFLLk4OltBsHd792G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Talk About Sex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
