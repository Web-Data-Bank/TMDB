Embarking on just such an adventure, Martijn Doolaard decided to cycle from Amsterdam to Singapore. One Year on a Bike chronicles his slow travels over 17,000 kmâ€”passing through the wilds of Eastern Europe, the mountains of Kyrgyzstan, and the temples of Myanmar. Stories of animal encounters, camping at salt lakes and on deserted beaches, and Iranian hospitality are accompanied by photography that captures the breathtaking scenery, the chance meetings and friendships, and the buzz of global cities. This movie and book details the beauty and self-discoveries, as well as the hardships and the gear necessary, on this incredible one-man journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qBGGyUg2bFaasSYeJFgRmqrV2td.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Amsterdam to Singapore","title":"One Year on a Bike","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
