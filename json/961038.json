That is the core of the film's persuasiveness, and everyone who watches it will agree. In just one scene, you are overwhelmed by the eroticism that his relationship with the owl radiates. Death is brought into focus in the scene where Pellet explains the relationship, but the clean images and restrained narration, which make even this seem effortless, accentuate the eroticism of the relationship. A semi-documentary created by the director's owl, which she has kept for 14 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Pzuiv9LnS1y6yi21oE3dRyzPLu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The ultimate form of love, is completed by three people.","title":"Pellet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
