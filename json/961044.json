The surrealistic design and the generous viewing experience give the impression that it is a \"picture book for adults\", but the thoughtful storyline, poetic narration and songs that suddenly appear are pleasantly unrestrained as if the film were aimed at children. However, this unrestrainedness is accompanied by a high degree of perfection, and although it is a flat animation that seems to be the opposite of the latest CG, it gives the impression of possibilities for expression that may even broaden the definition of cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iAvkoWlSRwscJMjtMKYe7qzDxGp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An enthralling, surreal fairy tale.","title":"The king of the 21st century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
