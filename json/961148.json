Like earlier experimental filmmakers, Kirby employs painterly abstraction, the radical condensation of time, and the direct registration of space on the material substrate of the medium. But she almost always uses formal schemas in order to return to the things themselves. Kirby examines the uniqueness, irreducibility, and the emotional ramifications of the particular moment, locating the palpable residues of the everyday. But like later, more systematic filmmakers such as Gehr, Akerman, and Snow, Kirby attends to the larger patterns, repetitions, and reversals that organize both perception and our lived experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Latent Light Excavations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
