Taken by night, Baranowsky filmed the full-moon holding the camera as steady as possible, manipulating the video only by framing the moon into a limited space. Due to the movement of the boat on the waves, the moon becomes a ball-like, rhythmically moving disc. The black and white of the image as well as the lack of any spatial indicators enhance the two-dimensionality of the work. Baranowsky plays with the expectations and experiences of the spectator.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iexkWeqFub1nKtRtcxbkH9SjmVU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mondfahrt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
