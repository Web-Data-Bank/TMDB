His harrowing journey is made worse, by the constant flippancy of his mysterious companion; a macabre musician with a dark sense of humour.  The pair set off to the end of the world and to the heart of a war, that has already taken so much of the soldier's sanity.  A stark portrayal of PTSD, mental health issues and the various coping mechanisms of soldiers and civilians during wartime. Set against a low fantasy, Lovecraftian backdrop.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/86n3oo0FU7BCMqy3owmbrCa7zal.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sober Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
