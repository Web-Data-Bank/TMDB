As she tries to shed light on the culture of violence and abuse in the Belarusian military, a group of young friends from the techno underground soon face being drafted themselves. They go to rave parties in undershirts and round sunglasses, but in a moment the party could be over – at least until huge protests break out in the streets following the recent ‘re-election’ of dictator-president and Putin sympathiser, Aleksandr Lukashenko. A glimmer of hope and a promise of change, which only causes the brutality of the authoritarian society to erupt in full force.","popularity":0.923,"poster_path":"/nnZ4ZZeKsDYHoAHxz8LJ886F7dE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196960,"logo_path":null,"name":"Folk Film","origin_country":""},{"id":122296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sisyfos Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":116145,"logo_path":null,"name":"Voka Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motherland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
