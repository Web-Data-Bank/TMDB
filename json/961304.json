But finding him will only be an excuse to achieve his true purpose: to understand his impossibility to openly and truthfully talk about fatherhood: the one he didn't have as a child, that was taken up by a lonely mother, self assumed by him, and reshaped by his siblings while growing up. The Living and the Dead is a film about love, honesty and forgiveness in a family where the living ones will have to resort to the dead to find the answers about who they really are.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Living and the Dead","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
