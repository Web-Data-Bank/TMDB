In the men's own words, through the stories they narrate, the film gives us insight into the time these men spent together and the bond they formed that remains unbroken to this day. The 4th Infantry Division is one of the only divisions that trained and retained its troops during the Vietnam War. The men of A-Company trained together for eleven months and served together for one year. Their story begins with basic training at Ft. Lewis Washington in 1965 and continues 40 years later at their last reunion in September 2007. Filming began September 27, 2007 in Houston, Texas during a reunion to honor First Sergeant David H. McNerney, who is the only living member of the 4th Infantry Division to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was celebrated by the men he trained and served with and who's lives he saved on March 22, 1967.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8WXq5KFjUquRUmt29G5RZ3ryWLB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"We all won the Medal of Honor that day.
