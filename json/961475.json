Uncompromising, often brutal group therapy sessions are designed to shake loose the excuses a victim makes for himself. The people and situations shown are authentic; only one actor was employed. The results obtained at Daytop are regarded by some psychiatrists as a breakthrough.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xz0qP31pNCQAGdmQE93bKQCuEax.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
