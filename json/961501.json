This sound emerges from his use of the video camera’s visual output run through his audioboard to the speakers: it is an analogue sonification of the video signal. As a purely audio-visual experience, the performance might seem similar to such early expanded cinema works as Paul Sharits’ Shutter Interface (1975) where a series of four film projectors overlap their frames, creating juxtapositions and combinations on screen – as in Second Hermeneutic; however, the difference is instantly apparent in the performance itself – the soundtrack emerges from the interaction of projected imagery resembling the bands and bars of an optical soundtrack, but with the addition of saturated color.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b9iXC8hoiPNOorGfQDfg57rklYV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Second Hermeneutic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
