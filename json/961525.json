Thus, the images were captured exploring different shutter speeds, exposures, camera movements, and all the means that would make it possible to catch more than 200 sculptures in Buenos Aires. These visual resources also allowed me to position my gaze as a filmmaker in a more awkward place and enabled other ways of visually recording the monuments, different from the tourist or institutional glance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4YZxSD8YgOSlkSB4mXFGjVnfVqa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imaginarium","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
