The occupation of shaman is female dominated and holds a dual reputation in contemporary Korean society. In one respect, shamans are considered lewd women who promote superstition; in another, they are seen as keeping alive the religious ideals of the past. The film follows one woman's trials from when she felt destined to be a shaman through her two-day initiation ceremony. The emotional impact of the ceremony, which is apparent throughout, reaches a climax during the ritual of the 'knife riding general' in which the initiate stands barefoot on knife blades in order to receive the spirits and speak in their voices.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Initiation \"Kut\" for a Korean Shaman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
