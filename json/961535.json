Billionaire Howard Hughes â€” the man who broke speed and round-the-world flying records. This 'event-oriented' documentary sheds light on Hughes' personality by showing new live footage of rare and lost on-camera interviews, press conferences and newsreel footage. Hear the words that Hughes spoke, read what he wrote, see what he created, directly from the man himself. Watch how Hughes breaks flight records and ends up crashing only to design and build a plane bigger than today's 747. See how he built Trans World Airways (TWA) into the most successful airline in the world.\r Learn why Hughes shifted his focus on creating covert relationships with the CIA, FBI, Johnson, Kennedy and Nixon, triggering phobias that engulfed this brilliant but tortured man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fhFlrLbGxRYVvDro32u7byza7ku.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howard Hughes: The Real Aviator","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
