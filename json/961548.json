Jerod isn't satisfied, but Sam thinks it's fine. The producer Kate arrives and she has a third different opinion. The three of them sit around debating what love scenes should be included in the film, discussing what inspires passion in love scenes, and often sharing erotic tales from their personal knowledge or previous films to get their point across. They also take turns pairing off for some behind the scenes erotic fun. Finally, Sam and Kate arrive at an unexpected conclusion, but have to convince Jerod to do some reshoots.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/1wJMCPe1p9XEbOw08nY2zVbpPOM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15232,"logo_path":null,"name":"MRG Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mainline Releasing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voyeur's Delight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
