The film stands as a treatise on the innate ability of the imagination to envision perpetually better worlds than the one we’re currently inhabiting, as well as the evocative power of music and art. The earthlings of Amis du Lac are no longer physically connected to their planet, but the planet itself lives on in an ever-expanding world of self-contained dreams and ideas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bu6ebiKQkfrxyr7cpwZMZJRZsjx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amis du Lac","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
