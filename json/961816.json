Compared to her life back in Ukraine, life in Israel is great for Christina. She works in a beauty salon, earns her own money, and loves Israel. Her Israeli husband Michael is also satisfied with this marriage. He is happy that he found a woman who can live with him. In fact, he is so satisfied that he starts his own little business scouting for Ukrainian brides for other Israeli men. Michael’s recent matchmaking is a special one—the bride’s name is Valeria, and she’s Christina’s younger sister. Michael went out of his way and found the best man he could get for her. His name is Eitan, and while he may not be the most handsome guy in the country, he is a good-hearted, generous man. However, Valeria is different to her older sister. And the whole delicate balance is at risk.","popularity":0.996,"poster_path":"/pHDrLeTC53BRIBi2pcCVu8h8ekx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182158,"logo_path":"/A8tAtUCP3UO6xJvCUFddoculbLo.png","name":"Lama Films","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":158723,"logo_path":"/prs1uyf0OyCa6hZRdXdC4JSUyM9.png","name":"ForeFilms","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valeria Is Getting Married","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
