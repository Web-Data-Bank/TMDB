FKA twigs’ collective ‘AVANT GARDEN’ launches its new era in this piece for the 2022 International Woolmark Prize. FKA twigs developed an exploration of play within creativity, a method in which the purest expression has a space to be birthed and happy accidents are embraced and elevated.  PLAYSCAPE, was inspired by Noguchi’s vision of play as a creative catalyst. Featuring and directed by English singer-songwriter and dancer FKA twigs, the film merges influence from fashion, art, dance, and music. Choreographed by classically trained dancer Juliano Nunes, the film opens with an empty gallery of Noguchi’s play sculptures, which becomes populated by a diverse ensemble cast of characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uPUGusZLllcqwCfOXImMxgwTbQY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173339,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zak Group","origin_country":""},{"id":173340,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Avant Garden","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PLAYSCAPE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
