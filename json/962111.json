The central argument of the film is that the Germans were the executioners of peaceful Soviet citizens. At the time, it made a very strong impression on both the accused and press. The film is a re-edited compilation of footage collected by the Soviet film team over four years (primarily used for propagandistic ends in wartime Soviet newsreels and documentaries). It was prepared in emergency by the Soviet prosecution team and minister of cinema following the projection of Nazi Concentration Camps presented by the Americans on November 29, 1945.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1946-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinodokumenty o zverstvakh nemetsko-fashistskikh zakhvatchikov","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
