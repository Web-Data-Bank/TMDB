We’ve teamed up with Twitch to bring you the best quality live stream and production possible.  The stream will be free and accessible for everyone around the world. We encourage donations as we’ve spent a lot and put a ton of time into making this the best it can be for our fans during these unprecedented times.  Filmed live at the Masquerade in Atlanta, we curated a set that we would have played live for you on tour. Additionally, we’ll be releasing a virtual merch line that will be sold for the duration of our concert. There will be contests giving away merch, vinyl and CDs. And to follow the concert, we’ll be hosting a post-show Q&A.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7589jEchLNR7B8Zaz1H07p4K68v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fit For a King - The Path Virtual Release Show","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
