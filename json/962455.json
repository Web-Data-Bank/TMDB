There under gentle coconut palms, he deliberates with colleagues who have managed to escape from their occupied homeland for the week-long meeting. Herman, a former political prisoner, has spent years working for liberation of his homeland. His journey to Australia, with forty-two other West Papuan asylum seekers, sparked global media attention in 2006. This is a documentary about non-violent resistance, courage in an undeclared war and loneliness in exile. It's about family, friendship, love, human rights, and great singing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2011-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West Papua: A Journey to Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
