Both pieces commissioned by writing platform Alexander\r alxr.com/  The process behind this film was an unusual, but very stimulating one. I was asked to make a film to exist as a companion piece for Marieke's new story, but rather than simply adapting it for screen I was invited to interpret & reimagine it in whatever way I wished. This freedom allowed for a really interesting creative process and has lead to an outcome where we have two brand new, wholly distinct stories that are nonetheless unmistakably close cousins- sharing a huge amount of creative and thematic DNA. After you watch the film I encourage you to read Marieke's story- it's great, and you might enjoy exploring the crossover of the two things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"IT'S NOT THE HOUSE","title":"Not The House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
