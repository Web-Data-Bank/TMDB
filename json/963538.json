Mid-morning heat, early summer. The house looks big, there's a garden, a car parked in front of the door: it's one of those long American cars. Los Angeles, around West Hollywood. Angela gets in the car, starts the engine, starts. She is wearing a summer dress, she is in her thirties. She drives slowly.; follows the mass of cars traveling at a moderate pace. She takes the avenues that open up in front of her, then perhaps by chance enters a highway, which she leaves a few minutes later. She drives aimlessly. Palm trees, foliage, cars, everything is covered in dust under the sun. \"Slow city moving fast\"...
