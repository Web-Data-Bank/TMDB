It is the effects and pictures of Jean Péraud, a reporter photographer who disappeared at Dien Bien Phu on May 8, 1954. Soon, the discussion begins between the young woman and the former press companions of Péraud who are present. Through the memories and stories she provokes, the ever-present questions about what makes the war image resurface: is the reporter a witness or a combatant? Does he protect himself from the effects of war by filming it, or does he take more risks in order to bear witness? Can we speak of art in front of this image made in the face of death?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qAaTG8XDk5yJZfpTJYp6SdeWFEq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les yeux brûlés","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
