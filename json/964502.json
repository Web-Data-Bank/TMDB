A second letter informs Harold that the money cannot be found, and that his legacy consists of one fur coat. Determined to make a splash in the village, he dons the coat and keeps his appointment with the belle, although it leaves him broke when she is done satisfying her Broadway appetite. Uncle Ben, the pawnbroker, comes in handy and after much haggling over the price, he relieves Harold of the legacy.
