Between (also during) shaves he amuses himself by playing solos on the violin or whatever instrument happens to be near at hand. Even when he is running the \"scythe\" over the chin whiskers of an unfortunate victim, he cannot resist the temptation to play a one handed serenade to himself on the flute. Intent on his music, he allows the weapons of his trade to wander aimlessly over the countenances of his customers with tragic results. When a Chink finds that his queue is among the missing, a fond mother sees her Percy shorn of his curly locks, and Wild Bill from out Nevada way misses half his hirsute adornment, bedlam is cut loose and the barber shop is ransacked. De Goat manages to escape his pursuers by hiding in a lunatic asylum, but when the superintendent sees him, he extends a cordial invitation to sojourn for a while in a padded cell.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vzelIjFGnztJZgWTH5xCG8ezBdc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Musical Barber","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
