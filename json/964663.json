Disobeying the Angel’s command not to look back, Lot’s wife turns into a salt statue. For this project the artist has made a series of drawings where the salt creates hollows in the paper, distorts it, damages it and in doing so, creates forms and designs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y8Fa7DkvLacwz6TZTOzL38uFO2p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Sea Drawing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
