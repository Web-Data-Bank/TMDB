The film explores the dynamics of inhabiting the in-between space of multiple countries and temporalities through visual and sound abstraction, interlacing and recycling pre-existing film materials and fragments of otherwise anonymous orphan films. Utilizing these so-called “scraps,” Currents is a film of extensive remediation, treated by hand through the use of the emulsion lifting technique, thereby re-imagining, re-constructing, and de-constructing the liminality of immigrant life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q3rw5kQ6j45FikmmGpwZOmbdi08.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Currents","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
