Be Here, Be Queer travels around the UK and dives into the world of small-town LGBT+ nightlife as it gets back on its feet post-Covid. It explores why queer venues are still so vital to small communities, and takes an upfront look at the impact - the good, the bad, and the ugly - mainstream exposure has had on queer culture, as told by the drag artists who helped create it. Meet venue owners, UK drag legends, Drag Race UK stars, and the kings and queens who perform every night in the bars and clubs of UK LGBT+ scenes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be Here, Be Queer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
