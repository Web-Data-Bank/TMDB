Betty returns to keep the appointment and is waiting but a moment when a wealthy young yachtsman comes ashore for provisions. He flits with Betty and Betty's heart is lost. John arrives to find his sweetheart in the stranger's arms. Betty ignores John's protests and agrees to the newcomer's proposal that she pack her things, meet him in half an hour and elope. John hides and awaits their return. The yachtsman is the first to arrive. He has his provisions and has not forgotten a bottle of stimulant, most of which he has already consumed. John thrashes him for stealing his girl, throws him into his rowboat, and orders him to get aboard his yacht and not to return. On board the yacht the intoxicated yachtsman drops a match near the oil tank.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":166440,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lass of Gloucester","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
