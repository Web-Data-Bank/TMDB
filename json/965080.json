Itâ€™s both a landmark and a community, an industry and a people, making magic in a dark theater, eight times a week. During the pandemic, over 96,000 people lost their jobs and an entire ecosystem of small businesses were brought to a standstill. Broadway Rising tells the story of the broadway community and its harrowing journey back to the stage following the COVID-19 shutdown. This feature documentary brings everyone into the spotlight - from the costume makers to the ushers to the producers to the stars.","popularity":1.578,"poster_path":"/hItrUasvvNKAMMvR5jxbEbN3ozm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"551 days to curtain.","title":"Broadway Rising","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
