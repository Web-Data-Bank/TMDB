Until the day when, while trying to help out a neighbor, they receive a substantial fine for \"illicit\" sale of a chicken at 10 euros... This news puts the Pécourneau family under even more pressure. As a last resort to lift the fine, they really start raising poultry, taking out a new loan at the bank. But a new European regulation cut their hopes short and put them in extreme difficulty once again. While her father's life is on hold and the future of the farm is greatly threatened, Emilie decides to publicize her story, mobilizing as many people as possible around her parents' cause.
