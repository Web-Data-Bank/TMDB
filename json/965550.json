The shelled creature we see wandering in this film bears traits of both male (egungun) and female (gelede) ancestors. The chasm of time, distance and violence has severed its link to the living leaving it to look and listen for traces of our lives in an endless disorienting loop. The film references the ancestor-reverent Egungun masking tradition of the Yoruba people who, indigenous to modern-day Ghana, Benin, Togo, and Nigeria, were among the many African ethnic groups captured, enslaved and sold as chattel into the Transatlantic Slave trade.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zIjaWVLLAljbZYK2np2nvy5Mzjy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Egungun (Ancestor Can't Find Me)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
