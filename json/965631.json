Blending humor and candor, the film incisively illuminates the vagaries in the concept of an “ideal” body type. A tension exists between the visual statement created by masks and mannequins and the rich diversity of the voices appearing in the film. Thirteen women, of varying age, size, and ethnicity, reveal the ambivalence with which they regard their own bodies. Their musings about specific body parts are underscored by archival footage of beauty competitions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"13 women, of varying age, size, and ethnicity, reveal the ambivalence with which they regard their own bodies.","title":"Mirror Mirror","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
