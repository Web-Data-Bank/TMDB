He is a world record holder and extreme athlete and had Markus Weinberg accompany him with his camera for his latest project. The plan: Jonas wants to complete the longest triathlon of all time, which should take him around the world. From Munich it should go back to Munich and that both running, swimming and on the bike. The journey begins turbulent and chaotic in the middle of the corona pandemic. Virtually overnight, previously planned travel routes become impassable. Border crossings that used to be easy are now becoming a complicated undertaking. But there are also rays of hope: During his 14-month journey, the “crazy German” became a phenomenon for people, giving them hope again in dark times.","popularity":0.641,"poster_path":"/mMOkorpBMKFYxTsJqZxVpnlBod2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jonas Deichmann - Breaking the Limit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
