There’s the physical and psychological border between Mexico and the US. And now, looking at a life behind bars, there’s the one that separates him from his loved ones. Since it is forbidden to film inside the jail, Reyes recreates Sansón’s life – with the help of his family – through letters and by casting an untrained actor to play his friend. The resulting film is a reflection on migration, the notion of family, what it means to see one’s life on film, and the harshness and injustice of the US prison system.","popularity":1.382,"poster_path":"/ubAVA3hatW3uq549tNQUlrZgzjt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sansón and Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
