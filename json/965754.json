The performance captures the British hard rockers unleashed on stage after being, like so many bands, stuck at home and unable to tour due to the worldwide pandemic. A formidable live band to begin with, the added dose of adrenaline coming from being tigers unleashed from a cage makes for a stunning live performance showcasing songs from their four studio albums, Inglorious, II, Ride To Nowhere, and We Will Ride, and their most recent studio recording, the covers album Heroine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iH0pe8346jxSyES25wMSgmVWIg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inglorious - MMXXI Live At The Phoenix","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
