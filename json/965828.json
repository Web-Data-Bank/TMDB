One of the students is assumed to climb the lightning rod to the top of the building. During its 'ascent' we look into the apartments on the next floors and observe the lives of their inhabitants. At some point, our hero falls and dies. Will this unnecessary death move life in the 'desert'?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incydent na pustyni","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
