I picked one of these, a blood pond, to create my image of animation. There is a heaven and hell in everyone’s mind and I think that people dance because we feel heaven and hell inside ourselves. I made many of the images using a kids’ graphic computer called “My First Sony,” which was very easy to use, and I edited these graphics into animation by using a Sony Handicam V-88 in its animation function.\" - Tamami Asada","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Place Where Dance Was Born","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
