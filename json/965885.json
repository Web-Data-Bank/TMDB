It was one of the first American heavy bombers to survive 25 combat missions over the deadly skies of Europe.  In 2005, a Belle arrived in Dayton for an exhaustive 13-year restoration at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, where the Memphis Belle is now on display. In this locally-produced documentary, combat diaries give unflinching, first-hand accounts of the Belle’s most dangerous missions. Interviews with the curator and restoration crew provide insights into the challenges of their long mission to restore the Belle. It’s a story of two teams of men, separated by 75 years, who shared a deep affection for a plane that became an American icon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3NkbxfNIpWxPpVWgqebMhg202m8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memphis Belle - Her Final Mission","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
