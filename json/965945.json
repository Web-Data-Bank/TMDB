Nezha is 46 years old. She works as maid for some French voluntary service workers in Marrakech. The film is built around five tableaux, five workdays, each one constructed around daily chores. The director watches Nezha watching her French employers who, for their part, pay little attention to her in exchange. The maid is part of the furniture. But Nezha laughs at everything, resists everything. Her story tells us about a certain world order.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nezha la bonne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
