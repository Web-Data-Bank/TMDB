Since Hank Snow and Hank Williams never performed together during their lifetimes this was a way to bring them together with their two songs, ‘Rambling Man’ and ‘I’ve Been Everywhere.’ The thereminist, Scott Marshall, takes the two songs to another place. Footage of the audience, which was built into the construction of the work, constitutes a component of the video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fFYO4uBBJDOE090NJcZwmqysQqJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Hanks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
