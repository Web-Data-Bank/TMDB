It is a bluebird's song of comrades and their joy, tinged with melancholy premonition-a song that comes from afar as though to rub shoulders with life directly, only to pass on. A story of two marriages, one lesbian and one gay. The parallel structure lays bare the complexity of queer love, but also the cruelty inherent to love itself. Domestic violence, faithfully captured by the camera, threads its way like a deep silent river, cutting out its course and leaving a path of marks and scars. The survivor is like a child who cannot explain, but can only remember.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hFx3dQSlxOacRghUSTZi8HC351t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memorandum on Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
