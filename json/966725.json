Their different disabilities don’t prevent them from pursuing their dreams. “My friends, they enjoy the beauty of nature. Birds might be flying in the sky, it might be snowing on mountain peaks, and then one of nature’s gifts is the rainbow, it might be so splendid, but we can’t see it”.  A young man works at a radio station (he is also partly blind). Another stitches uniforms for kids in the village (while in a wheelchair). They all dream of living a meaningful life and, in many different ways, of being an active part of their communities. Dreams that are not so easy to fulfill given the myriad challenges they face in a country known as the land of “Gross National Happiness”. Much more must be done to support their inclusion. “You should be able to explore all kinds of jobs and unreservedly enjoy your life,” says one of them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mm9H9O5UPU2yuwgKeQ2ceK8O1jz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BT","name":"Bhutan"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams of Birds Flying in the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
