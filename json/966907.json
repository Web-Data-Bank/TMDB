The unbearable tensions between the two lead singers are finally resolved with the decisive intervention of one of their mothers.  The co-production by Ópera de Lyon along with the Grand Theâtre de Genève and Teatro Real is brought to life by Laurent Pelly, a tireless champion of Donizetti's comedies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3X6TmtUZz7OUpYWVcRJHtL2RNH6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Real de Madrid","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An opera where the prima donna is a baritone?","title":"Viva la Mamma!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
