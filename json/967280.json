Rock ’n’ roll is the key motivator here. “Blue Wonderful” is wrapped in guitars and features a solo from album producer T Bone Burnett. “Guilty Pleasure” is raucous fun. Taupin’s deft lyrical touch shines on “I’ve Got 2 Wings” and “The Open Chord”, both flush with clever turns of phrase. “A Good Heart” is pure Elton balladry—heartfelt feelings framed by his timeless voice. “Looking Up” expresses gratitude with characteristic flair, like a 2016 version of “I’m Still Standing”. Wonderful Crazy Night shows that rock ‘n’ roll remains Elton John’s North Star.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Elton’s Wonderful Crazy Night!","title":"Elton John: Wonderful Crazy Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
