Father and mother are willing, but decide to give Roscoe a scare before accepting him for a son-in-law. Father assumes a gruff attitude but melts at the right time and Roscoe departs in high glee to prepare for a masked ball at which the engagement is to be announced. Irene jokes him about his size but he warns her that he will fool her by the mystery of his disguise. On the way home in his automobile Roscoe drives over a cliff and is taken to a hospital. There he is, out of his mind, as the guests begin to assemble at the ball.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sMuZ2eZLbDPjK6eSHdSJ71lV4de.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
