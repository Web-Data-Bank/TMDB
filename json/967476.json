The area includes one of the world's densest concentrations of wild brown bears. 84-year-old fisherman Ose Hatsusaburo has forged a remarkable relationship with these creatures over a lifetime of working among them. Bears obey his commands without a fuss, and no fisherman has suffered a bear attack in 50 years. A rapidly shifting climate and recent UNESCO directives mean this unique way of life now faces an uncertain future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qoSioO8cAgECgyL1ZLlwxT3xHA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bearman of Hokkaido","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
