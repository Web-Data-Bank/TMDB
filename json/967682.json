To white Los Angelenos, the murder was just more proof that Mexican American crime was spiraling out of control. The police fanned out across LA, netting 600 young Mexican American suspects. Almost all those taken into custody were wearing the distinctive uniform of their generation: Zoot Suits. The tragic murder and the injustice of the trial that followed, coupled with sensational news coverage of both, fanned the flames of the racial hostility that was already running rife in the city. Within months of the verdict, Los Angeles was in the grip of some of the worst violence in its history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dDoUUZni6tpjrvDSmxBETvZeASJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zoot Suit Riots (American Experience)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
