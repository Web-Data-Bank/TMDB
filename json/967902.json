A married couple expose themselves to a cameraÂ´s objective gaze, while at the same time face it with their own, resolute gaze-and the riddle of a fragmentary plot. The staging thematizes the material it uses through minor errors in the image, like those that appear at the beginning and end of every 16mm film reel, and \"bad\" cuts, ghostly in between frames. What happens between the images?
