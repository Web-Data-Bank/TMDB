The multi-channel work features footage the artist shot in the Everglades region of Southern Florida over the past two years. Focusing on an inhospitable terrain teeming with development, agriculture and tourism, Forever and Forever sidesteps the familiar, moralizing narrative of ecological decay, illuminating instead a more nuanced dynamic between man and nature. While at times ominous and visually foreboding, the work underscores this fraught duality in a frenetic and fragile exchange, capable of extreme beauty and decimation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xxEnaJMrdsiDL0ispyLFePQb36L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forever and Forever","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
