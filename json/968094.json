When a fast talking private detective shows up on her doorstep, Lilith is faced with the case of a lifetime. A new drug has hit the streets of Fable, black market Ouija boards are everywhere, victims of bizarre murders are choking the city morgue, and the prime suspect is an ancient demon masquerading as an urban vagrant.

Never a dull day in the twilight city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7g5p695knA6PGKWGAHgywrTwt9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174236,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Dark Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fable: Teeth of Beasts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
