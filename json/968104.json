Tribal elders recall the days of the youth and their romances. They tell of the creation of the Paiwan people, and lament the end of tribal life, crushed by the irresistible and contradictory forces of government policies and alien cultural influences. Talking of love, both the charm and cruelty of a traditional society are revealed. For many of the Paiwan, love may be a high point of a young life – but it is also the gateway to sorrow. But in the end, it is the high spirits, the playful romances and the family spirit of the Paiwan which shine through.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vNcF78POGaCUcY4RT0wg2Ntpgsm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sounds of Love and Sorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
