But on the way, he will have to deal with a strange companion from another world on a secret mission and the whims of Queen Genevieve, whose past is gradually resurfacing. Nothing will be spared him, neither the witch, nor the mage, nor the black queen who will launch her army of Igor followers after them. But Grelot will have to face much more than the follies and traps of each one. He will also have to face their secrets and his own, if he wants, together with Captain Trip, to bring Queen Genevieve back alive and save his kingdom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w7iAnfUnYQscGeOUZVqUhysJsFi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119613,"logo_path":null,"name":"FESTIZICNEMA / OG Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ménestrel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
