With the occasion so well attended, it's no surprise that the camera focuses on the spectacle of the town's packed streets: almost every shot is crammed with local faces.  The film was probably commissioned by local cinema director Clifford Spain, who produced and edited a number of local films to support his programmes at the Capitol cinema in Walton-on-Thames.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1931-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Crowds pack out Chertsey's streets to hear who their new MP will be","title":"Declaration of the Poll at Chertsey Town Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
