We look at the most extreme cases of vet-phobia across the country.  In four funny or shocking cases we stage an intervention and send in our vet to help these most extreme cases. The vets will be able to treat animals in their own homes (if they can catch them!) and more crucially help the owners with strategies for getting their pets to the vets in future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pets Who Hate Vets","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
