But his aim is to go to Dubai and earn millions. His persevering brother (Sijju) manages to send him to the Gulf. But alas, when Siva actually lands in Dubai, he realizes he has been duped by the recruitment company and eventually he gets framed in a murder case. Siva’s brother who comes to Dubai to help matters out is killed. This is good enough reason for Siva to take a vow to kill the killers of his brother. He does that eventually after a ketchup show of mayhem and some misplaced songs. Woven into this are the story of his love and that of a night club dancer in Dubai (Navneet Kaur and Meghana Naidu).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2004-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Telugu","iso_639_1":"te","name":"తెలుగు"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shatruvu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
