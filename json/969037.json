This film, shot in black and white and hand developed, evokes a bygone era through texture and tone, while interview commentary meanders between yearnings to preserve the millennia-old tradition and complex discussions of the arbitrary nature of borders. Through the telling of Scottish-English fishing rivalries, water is revered and imbued with power beyond tools and industry â€“ it is the tide that dictates the line in the Solway Firth between the two countries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HAAF","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
