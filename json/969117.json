It seems as if an outside force has taken control of her emotions. \"BITE\" by Charlotte Lim is about a school girl, meticulously observed by a patient camera in a small, yet sensitive story. Perhaps a lesson in life, for it isn't as innocent as it seems and \"BEDSIDE MANNERS\" by Yeo Joon Han is about a man who lies in bed, paralyzed. He can still see and hear and has to suffer the stupid talk of a bunch of idiots. Satire on all sorts of things in Malaysia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hKIa59BRgiPZIiwKWoRT8YSnUyu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2016-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day and Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
