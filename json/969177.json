During the next two months, two homemade pipe bombs would explode on the campus of Florida Agriculture and Mechanical University (FAMU). Each bombing was followed by racist phone calls to a local television station in the area. It became clear that whoever was setting off the bombs was doing it out of pure hatred of Black people. The FBI released taped phone calls of the suspected bomber to the public, asking for any tips that could lead to an arrest. Several witness came forward claiming the voice heard on the phone was that of Tallahassee resident Lawrence Lombardi. This is his story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o4oDvu0MfLhyIfojdBqhGOeTS4p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fear in Florida: When Hate Becomes a Crime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
