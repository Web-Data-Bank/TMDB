The parents of the murdered man don’t know the truth and have been waiting for their son to return home. A nomadic female poet comes to Luxi to shoot a documentary and hears about the story. A few days later, she leaves the man she met on the road without saying goodbye, and the reason is written into a verse: \"One person blocks the wind so that other clouds can see the rain in the afterlife. We’ve been stuck in it.” The vicissitude of life can be sensed from the ancient street in Luxi.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jSc6589u13qDcNBzukgBuM3MRJc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mysterious Object At Noon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
