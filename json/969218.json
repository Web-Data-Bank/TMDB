Over fifty years ago, Esterhaseâ€™s entire filmography of seven underground movies was destroyed while he was travelling in South America. His luggage, containing the only copies of these works, was thrown overboard during a mutiny on a boat he had booked passage on. The incident ended with the mutineers being summarily executed and the reclusive Esterhase gave up making films. All he left behind were these two abortive attempts to begin again late in life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pKgab6ngMaaoxOqhheigRn9bg7l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Films of Humphrey Esterhase","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
