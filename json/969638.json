Their arid land is pierced with blocks of color, each dwelling singular in a stylized way. Their resplendent clothing also boldly proclaims their identity. This unique film also explores Ndebele rituals never shown on film before. We see their fertility rites, a celebration that bonds them to their ancestral tradition. Ndebele performance art shows how traditional forms of expression can become a vehicle for political empowerment today. Nelson Mandela referred to the Ndebele as a 'Rainbow People.' Despite a history of racial oppression, forced removal from their ancestral land and economic privation, their pride and sense of joy has endured.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ndebele Women & The Rituals of Rebellion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
