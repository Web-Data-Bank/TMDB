Built around the world's first transgender gospel choir, the film portrays the choir's dilemmaâ€”how to reconcile their gender identity with the widespread belief that changing one's gender goes against the word of God. Set against the story of the Transcendence Gospel Choir's founding, the documentary reveals the lives of its members, including Tom, once a radical lesbian feminist; Ashley, choir founder and professional sound engineer; and Bobby, a recovering drug addict and former sex worker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dJ4JKjfb1YM8GP9C8Zj4Dk9KbsU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Believers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
