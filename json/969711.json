There seems to be a spell on these minorities, an evil spell, despite which life must go on. This tape, tells a straight forward story (which in reality is an allegory) about two lesbians and their attempt to cure themselves of the \"spell\". They are aided by a gay man (which allows for comments on the ongoing rivalry between gays and lesbians), and they find their salvation in the hands of a benevolent dancer/witch in Mexico.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chichenitz Ah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
