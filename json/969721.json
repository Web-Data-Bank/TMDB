With perspectives ranging from basic to nuanced, these children openly share their thoughts on the words that they hear on a daily basis. We hear so much about school bullying these days that iitâ€™s refreshing to have an opportunity to hear children speak thoughtfully about how they want to be treated, how they want others to be treated in their schools, and how the language we use affects how children see the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pkSAHDkoPVthPa0JpVWXxDmQVT6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Do You Know?
