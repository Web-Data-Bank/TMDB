Based on the life story of revue artist Heintje Davids, De Breij sings, dances and tells about a little girl who was told by her father that she was 'too fat and ugly' for the stage. Later, when she had long conquered that stage, there were people who decided that people like Heintje were too Jewish to be allowed to be there. But whoever stopped her, whatever happened: Heintje was there, and she always came back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5dgmlYmr0B6BFU4luzsSTZZPHwM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100462,"logo_path":"/24dhPKt8sDtfWfNs1rsVtskOwZZ.png","name":"BNNVARA","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":167159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Breijwerk","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claudia de Breij: Hier Ben Ik","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
