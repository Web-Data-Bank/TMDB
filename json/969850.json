The Abh star force won a decisive battle at Aptic Gate, completely breaking the counter offensive of the United Mankind fleet. Now a new operation has begun: Operation Hunter — seek and completely annihilate all of the remaining scattered fleet.  Basroil, part of 4th fleet, was sent to the Lobnas system on an escort mission. Lafiel and Jinto were assigned to become acting governor/vice governor of the system and negotiate with the planet-side government to establish empire rule. But little did they know that that the Lobnas system is a prison planet of United Mankind and millions of prisoners are just about to start a rebellion to overwhelm the security forces detached there.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4drRoMN5U82aGq1BkxcGwW1bjzF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3153,"logo_path":"/yKZ9UarLSu9Y4Gpw33nKRQOPM7z.png","name":"SUNRISE","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2005-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Banner of the Stars II Movie","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
