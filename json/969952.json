After dinner, her parents asked her to get in the car, so that they could take her to buy a birthday present. However, what awaited her was not a shop, but an institution on Gele Mountain in Chongqing. Xiaodi’s parents believed that sending her there would help convert Xiaodi, and turn her into a ‘normal’ boy. But in the face of violence and humiliation, Xiaodi hardened her resolve, and waited for a chance to escape. This gripping, uncomfortable documentary features interviews with Xiaodi, who recounts first-hand her traumatic experiences, as well as her mother, who discusses her motivations and changing perspective on questions of gender.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oIMQOGaNdK13upXt8NchC23DtiN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Xiaodi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
