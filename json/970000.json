The route: an obstacle course! Power lines lead to a forced stop. Tight curves and steep descents require filigree work. A real tough job for heavy haulage professional Randolf Peters.  Schleenhain in Saxony, around 40 kilometers south of Leipzig. Here, lignite is mined in open-cast mining on a large scale. If a digging point is exhausted, the heavy equipment must be relocated to the next excavation site. Since the drive station with its enormous dimensions does not simply fit on a normal low-loader, Randolf Peters relies on two SPMT (Self Propelled Modular Transporter), so-called self-propelled vehicles, which are driven by radio remote control for the transport.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/so6wJ4UzJfdOBAwDJUiQtYMwCER.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138741,"logo_path":null,"name":"WELT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Haulage in Action- A Steel Giant On The Road","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
