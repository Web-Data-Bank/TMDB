Everything the site needs must be transported via a long and arduous route. These transformers weigh over 200 metric tons each - they have to travel 4,000 kilometers before they reach their final destination. The workers at Megatranz are experts: long distances are easy for them. The haulage convoy covers most of the route easily - but the last 100 kilometers are difficult.  The temperature is 40 degrees Celsius in the shade, the conditions merciless, the roads dusty and the bridges old. This is demanding work for the workers and the cargo. But it’s also a bonding experience. Mistakes can be fatal. The way across the river is dangerous. A ferry is repurposed into a barge: a highly risky maneuver. Nerves of steel are just part of the job - but that’s no use when your luck runs out.","popularity":0.862,"poster_path":"/nFihWSWePtVz62nb96LZfwEFE3p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138741,"logo_path":null,"name":"WELT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Haulage- In The Jungle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
