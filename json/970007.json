Built for ocean-going service, the trawler is out in the fishing grounds of the Pacific for more than 300 days a year. This ship can process and transport around 6,000 tons of fresh fish.  The fish is sorted and frozen in the factory below deck. The trawler's fishing areas are in the English Channel, but also in the North Atlantic and the Pacific. The week-long journeys are a great physical challenge for the committed crew. Our documentary gives insights into the tough everyday life at a fishing expedition on a board the giant ship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7pWfLJw1ILzL9fJIgGISffCrDv6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138741,"logo_path":null,"name":"WELT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On A Fishing Expedition- Germany's Biggest Deep-Sea Trawler","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
