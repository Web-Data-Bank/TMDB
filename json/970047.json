Pendleton has explained that these works “verge on the monumental; they can take months to make and capture a deep history of marks and impressions. Minor moments become major moments because of how they articulate who we are or who we might be at any given moment. It’s a visual poetics of disruption.” These paintings, Pendleton has suggested, ask: “how do you leverage, subvert, and deploy your subjectivity? We all are doing it all of the time. It becomes more interesting when we’re aware that we’re doing it.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iRCbyYLMMbvUDYsW3ZwDQHCnGSU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruby Nell Sales","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
