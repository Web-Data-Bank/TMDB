In a series she began making in 2018, Mira reflects on how mythology intersects with contemporary lived experiences of violence, colonialism and desire. Mira’s installation includes footage of her performing as a tiger in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, a ritual at the site of late artist Theresa Hak Kyung Cha’s 1982 murder, as well as a radio broadcast that has been transmitting in her studio from an unknown source. Informed by spiritual practices and shamanism—Mira’s great-grandmother lived as a shaman during the period of the Japanese occupation of Korea when it was outlawed—the works are radically open-ended, guided by circumstance and direct embodied experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w95XrXhDRQ5fy9CB4LxO6ARBwMp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Vision (Red as never been)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
