It explores the seedy underbelly of rogue law enforcement officers and the atrocious results as they collide head on with a frustrated young man and a conflicted member of the police force. Itâ€™s a race against time in a haze of palpable tension, a powder keg tethering on the brink of imminent combustion.","popularity":1.26,"poster_path":"/hhIAnXjgnVV5nEpVkjKQhiSFxgI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Collision Course","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
