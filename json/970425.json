This presentation is a sampler of a much larger story which opens avenues for further research. It brings together personal stories, interviews, history, and memories. These fragments of interwoven conversations of aunts, uncles, sisters and cousins reveal their common link to two brothers who, in the 19th century, went in search of a transition from slave legacy to effectuate self-sufficiency.
