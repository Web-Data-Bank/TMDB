The messages are destined for various recipients, some identified and some not. From one voice to the next, the tone shifts from recognition and joy to boredom and anger. The degree of familiarity varies; the messages range from banal matters to the serious illness of a relative. All these voices have the goal of being heard on the other end of the line and eventually receiving an answer. Infinite Distances explores how we communicate, evoking recent nostalgia for the landline and pointing to our fundamental need to connect, share, and be heard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wCR6mU3nXjFo1XC6B7pXvpARxe7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Infinite Distances","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
