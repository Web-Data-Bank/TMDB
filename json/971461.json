The sound is recorded on a magnetic material coated on the film at the same time as shooting, and the sound on the cassette tape is mixed and played back at the time of screening. Sometimes a projectionist calls on the audience. This is a ritual that transforms the original shape and brings the dismantled \"movie\" back to the theater.
