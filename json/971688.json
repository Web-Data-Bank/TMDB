The filmed illustrations are allowed to speak for themselves as still images during a prolonged cinematic time, a kind of viewing time. In a reciprocal and dense interaction with a collage of noise from trains, rain, thunder, a ticking clock and organ music, the material is brought to life and the narrative of the film slowly emerges. Because the images in Le génie civil are taken out of their original context and placed in another time and space, they link the past with an ongoing present.﻿﻿","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pSh4lLi9dFUSXfwSHp1hzgEDEpc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of the Buffalo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
