Nomadism has deep spiritual meaning for the Taigana; their annual migration represents the cyclical nature of life to them and has profound sacred meanings. All their activities are dictated by the world of the spirits. They believe the valleys and mountains are inhabited by their forefathers and by the Supreme Divinity.The Taigana are entirely dependent on their reindeer. They use the sturdy animals to move along the same paths their ancestors did for hundreds of years. Each family owns ten to seventy reindeer which provide most of the diet of the Taigana. The meat is dried and preserved while the milk is used for drinking and making cheese. The skin is utilized to make clothing for the extremely cold winter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taigana: The Last Reindeer People in Mongolia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
