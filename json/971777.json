The studio album came out when both figures were at high points in their careers commercially. The recording sessions getting started in August 1956, the tracks specifically featured Oscar Peterson on piano, Buddy Rich on drums, Herb Ellis on guitar, and Ray Brown on bass. Seminal record producer Norman Granz masterminded the affair.  Ella and Louis Again, which features nineteen songs, primarily consists as a collection of vocal duets like its predecessor. However, seven selections do involve either Armstrong or Fitzgerald singing without the other. The backing group remained the same except for Buddy Rich's role being taken by Louie Bellson; Bellson is regarded as one of the greatest drummers in history right alongside Rich by critics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong: Ella and Louis & Ella and Louis Again","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
