Split decision is a boxing term used when the judges divide their votes in finding a winner. In this case the fight is between the two heroes of the film who are seen intermittently in a bar, negotiating a pick-up, and at home, breaking up in a domestic quarrel. The fight is also in the telling, between modes of conventional representation and modes of radical representation - between conventional continuity editing, and abstraction created through computer generated grids. The film features an appearance by Carolee Schneemann and digital imaging from before the era of personal computers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jBBVGAZ9t718XXf5L15tyWSnur9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32040,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York State Council on the Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":174809,"logo_path":null,"name":"Millennium Film Workshop","origin_country":""},{"id":174812,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Committee on Visual Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Split Decision","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
