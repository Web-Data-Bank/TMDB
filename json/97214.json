Disillusioned with post-World War II America, Beat Generation writers and painters came together because they felt mainstream America was becoming out of touch with humanity and the individual. In their interviews, characters such as 'Allen Ginsberg' , Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac, and Gregory Corso express their disdain for a society that defines success and happiness in terms of superior technology, cars, and clothing. Those individuals discuss the false conventionality of society and the dangerous world of shock treatments and conformity in which they found themselves. Their goal is to redefine this world to reflect the endless possibilities that characterize America.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An investigation of the Beat Generation","title":"The Beat Generation: An American Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
