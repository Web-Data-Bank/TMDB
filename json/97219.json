In CAN -- The Documentary,  the remaining band members are interviewed amidst culled together archival footage from talk shows, concerts, and television appearances to paint a portrait of a band who always remained happily on the sidelines of mass appeal, mixing street music, jazz, folk, and rock into a sometimes poppy, sometimes abstract stew. The band's influence on such seminal acts as Sonic Youth and Talking Heads is also analyzed.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/lrRL1YVTGbRRxs16rF5aVtX6Ijt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20005,"logo_path":null,"name":"DoRo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CAN: The Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
