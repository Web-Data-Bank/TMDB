Sam Kimura seeks to prove his patriotism by fighting for his country in the war, but sister Kei fiercely protests the governmentâ€™s treatment of her people. An uplifting testament to the power of the human spirit, ALLEGIANCE follows the Kimuras as they fight between duty and defiance, custom and change, family bonds and forbidden loves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qb1Se2rOASU5Apn7de3kPWNRiyz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palo Alto Players","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Allegiance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
