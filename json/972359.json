Dramatically pleading guilty to all of the charges at the last moment of the trial, he was sentenced to life in a secure unit for incest, imprisonment, raping the victim - who bore seven children - and causing the death of one child by neglect. This documentary explores the crime itself, Fritzl's trial and the aftermath for everyone involved, and ponders how anyone can possibly recover from such an ordeal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9nQJc8M6u7J4LISv44Y9dMbhQTg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fritzl: What Happened Next","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
