The struggles, sufferings, betrayals and self-sacrifice were later translated and woven through Macedonian songs, stories, tales and plays. Starting from there, this TV movie approaches the events of that time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rWk2GgGLIUxqvU0MfMcvlElFOOw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Televizija Skopje","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"1993-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let God Kill the Spies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
