Body parts (mouths, chests, arms, eyes) filter in evanescent motion between frames, referencing early cinema while eerily anticipating an uncertain future. As a cross-continental virtual production, “In Our Being/Sa Aming Pagkatao ” explores themes of alienation, queerness, Afro-futurism, and the flux of self-concept through collage-making and performance art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tr502LC1jCJD9igbAMqZPowm94a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Our Being/Sa Aming Pagkatao","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
