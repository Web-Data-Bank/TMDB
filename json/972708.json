This spoof on PBS-style, home improvement shows uncovers the behind-the-scenes antics of the making of a short, wildly Queer, shoestring-budget T.V. pilot. Laughter abounds as this multi-cultural, multi-generational, rag tag, T.V. crew, unleashes a gay array of sexual attitudes, ambitions, and wits that challenge the 55-year-old host to refocus his priorities through the kaleidoscopic lens of aging in the LGBTQ+ community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1rtaYqq4GPdFewhhiVmstK4w0zB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sex, Love & Glory Hole Cozies","title":"This Old Tearoom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
