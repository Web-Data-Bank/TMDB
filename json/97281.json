The stories are interlaced with each other. Characters with a small performance in one story will play a major part in one of the other two stories so we will learn more about them, on the other hand central characters appear again in the periphery of one of the other stories. It is done in a casual way, comparable with the situation in daily life when two friends are running into each other by chance. Petra and Nicole in their shrill world of brightness. Loafing around, bumming and teasing guys.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/cPAq4VfdYgNyt2PGAI564yGHj37.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Novotny \u0026 Novotny Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":1833,"logo_path":"/uwoSxaCjO4Ls5yUXgvny9ydFJxf.png","name":"Epo-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1998-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shrill, Bright World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
