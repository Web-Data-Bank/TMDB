You would change the way it educates its children. The U.S. Government knew this in the 19th century when it forced Native American children into government boarding schools. Today, volunteers build schools in traditional societies around the world, convinced that school is the only way to a 'better' life for indigenous children. But is this true? What really happens when we replace a traditional culture's way of learning and understanding the world with our own? SCHOOLING THE WORLD takes a challenging, sometimes funny, ultimately deeply disturbing look at the effects of modern education on the world's last sustainable indigenous cultures.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/q2IZTuNvxhtlQijkYcYcm1BTeuJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schooling the World: The White Man's Last Burden","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
