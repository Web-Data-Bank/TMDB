Too many of our communities, here and around the world, are facing housing crises, food insecurity, social isolation, and more. In addition, the multiple impacts of the Covid pandemic and climate change are current and ongoing. How can we most effectively confront these challenges, and help our communities thrive in an economic system that leaves many feeling trapped in poverty?  Founder Julia Milne and her team have created a completely replicable model for developing strong, connected, resilient communities – a model that could be put in place across thousands of communities in Aotearoa and millions of communities across the world. They’ve proven it can be done, this film was made to help them share the story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kBukgQ2Gmy5xPgJpxKqpPaSNASQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102831,"logo_path":"/wPSdOxHQCr3OD09Tbc2m0VMPPNg.png","name":"Happen Films","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Building communities that thrive.","title":"Together We Grow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
