The film traces the girls’ naturally fraught sibling dynamic and the ways that their father’s absence ignites their imagination. When they meet a stranger in the forest they become enchanted by a world of creative work and nature, a welcome distraction from their volatile mother. Play and the dreamlike space they inhabit provides an expansive and ultimately grounding setting for the girls’ response to war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8dRBW6SwwWNSqwpP3CL4dPeD5QD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
