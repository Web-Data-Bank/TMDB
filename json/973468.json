The city is in the grip of violence and distrust. Wilfried does what he can for himself, avoiding paths that are too slippery.

Wilfried struggles to survive as the persecution of the Jews proceeds unabated.","popularity":1.639,"poster_path":"/59S7D3zZyd9hR3OVJ2QoXwK4bmO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168531,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lecter Scripted Media","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":109046,"logo_path":"/xg8hZrLQoz8Q47KhoUeFD6FYT5S.png","name":"Menuetto","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":12583,"logo_path":"/vnYEkRJgZ9w1ZL777SGNqNV74b8.png","name":"Minds Meet","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":1926,"logo_path":"/sORCydQs61kwWqRIIzPiBpgVVag.png","name":"Les Films du Fleuve","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":24845,"logo_path":"/eRT3fMGdAaQaFyOYXMEIt8GCe6I.png","name":"Topkapi Films","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":175008,"logo_path":null,"name":"K \u0026 K Selekt Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2023-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"They were times for ambiguity and contempt, and in that they do not differ from other times, which is to say they have not gone by.","title":"Wil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
