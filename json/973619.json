He has gone from being Blur’s charismatic frontman to the brains behind Gorillaz, the producer of African artists, and the composer of post-modern opera. With sales of around 35 million records, and 24 albums with six different line-ups, the global success of this man ahead of his time is undeniable. In the UK, he is perhaps more than just a star; he’s a public persona. And his vertiginous career tells an intimate and intense story of his relationship with his home country over the past 25 years. From popstar to anonymous cartoon character, he shifts effortlessly between musical genres, but his style always seems to stay true to his British roots.","popularity":0.649,"poster_path":"/g3f7xLZpFjAUcIkZ7oIxvMciAqj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":175265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urbania Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Damon Albarn: A Modern British Tale","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
