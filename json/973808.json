The authors of the series tried to show, in particular, the weekday of the Nazi occupation in Poland. Conspiracy, military actions and shootings were programmatically relegated to the background. In return, \"Polish Roads\" provided a cross-section through all the then social strata. They told about people often surprised by history who gradually learn the sinister logic of Nazi terror.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iN2Cy5ZGyUawldrP2ftTenTY7Ye.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":949,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polskie drogi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
