Feeling pressured to present himself as an erudite artist, Leslie decides to live out the premise of his own film. When questioned about the influence of Hong Sang-soo’s films in his work during an interview, Leslie denies the influence, and instead cites a fictional Korean director named Yoo Un-sung as an influence in order to build a persona as somebody who champions underground cinema; he also takes other people’s ideas, and passes them off as his own during Q&A’s. Everything seems to have gone well... until a few months later when, at another Q&A event, a woman named Kristen Kim shows up to ask where she can find Yoo Un-sung’s films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven or Las Vegas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
