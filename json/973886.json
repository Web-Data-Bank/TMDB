Its images come from a combination of cyanotype, a blue-and-white photographic process dating back to the 1840s, and actual plant material adhered to physical film. I hand-coated clear 16mm leader with cyanotype chemicals, then used sunlight to make photogram-style, cameraless exposures of plant matter I had gathered in and around the stream in Eaton Canyon. Cyanotypes are processed using water, and for this film, I used stream water that I had also collected from the canyon. I approached the film as though the stream, what was in it, its surroundings, the film, the chemicals, and I were all extensions of one another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/idpXMTLij45nn6DkTlHLgdiVIFg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Mining (Eaton Canyon)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
