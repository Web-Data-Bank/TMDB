Symbols of the Maidan revolution – Molotov cocktails and burning tires – had already appeared in 2010 in a small village near Odessa. The community’s voice was not heard, and a peaceful protest against a mighty state energy project inevitably turned into violent clashes. Live Power is a four-year story, the story of the fight by the residents of the village of Usatovo against two transmission lines financed by EBRD to be built over their village, a story with the happy end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qj6xNRiXkVqtRmKoGc8PxzauYI0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live Power","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
