The film, captured with a hand-cranked Bell & Howell 16 mm camera, documents the most magnificent five-year ceremony in Paiwan tribe. During the festival, the Paiwan people expect to receive blessings of the gods and ancestors by piercing rattan balls with extended bamboo poles; however, they also try to prevent any harm caused by evil spirits. The Paiwan five year ceremony is not only the reunion of the dead and the living, but a meeting of the old and the new.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jVgTSZT770ZLk5RvlzJY71Ajc50.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Gods and Ancestors: Paiwan Five Year Ceremony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
