That lonely flower cannot help telling you that it lies. They are of tenderness but of secrets, of passions but of estrangement, of embraces but of confrontations. Three flowery boys, beautiful, but paralyzed in seeing their perishment. The ambiguous love raises imagined woman as protection; the body of lust offered as a comfort is soon held as captive of sentiments, thrown among ruins. The love is as undistinguishable as the hatred. My offering, can it ask for a receipt? Your departure, can I call an emergency?

In search for that lying flower, which survives, but speechless.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1T8rcwH6rsuY96U3BJkEEqJIwCe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiramisu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
