It is said that the emerging Komada group is in a state of immediate action aiming at the long-established Fujishiro group's sima. Voices of anxiety began to rise even within the Kanto Ichienkai due to the turmoil of the neighboring organization. And it was also the fear of the Kanto full-scale war that would come if the emerging Komada group won the Hitachi Union.
