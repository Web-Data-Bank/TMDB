The manufactured food business is bigger than Big Oil; that kind of money buys inconceivably large amounts of propaganda, misinformation and corrupted science. Processed People is a wake-up call with factual, hard-hitting health commentary that is rarely heard. If you're searching for the un-processed truth about diet and health, look no further.","popularity":0.682,"poster_path":"/m5KRF9yr4DwmS6lVldFMp4Tq7Pz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Antidote to America's Toxic Lifestyle","title":"Processed People","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
