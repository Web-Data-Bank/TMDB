After Orwa leaves Syria for Lebanon, he presents all the materials he recorded to his brother Eyas, the filmmaker residing in Belgium, to complete the film project he was working on, which is to show the peaceful face of the Syrian revolution. Eyas begins searching in these materials for that face to discover another face of his brother and his young companions who risked their lives to bring the revolution into action.  Defeat and betrayal are part of the story of the movement against which the world allied itself, as the regime managed to distort it and turn that beautiful face into a violent one.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1vlFaa2SmomuFx3MMaFlM2srQJp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The final scene","title":"The Final Scene","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
