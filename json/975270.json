The film documents drawings the audience made during a performance given by the musician Evan Parker. Polly Read gave each member of the audience a small booklet and pencil; on each page a circle has been drawn. The audience responded to the music over the course of the performance by drawing in the book. The film animates these images bringing them back into conflict with one of the musical pieces performed on the night. The results are a mixture of abstract marks, impressionistic portraits, and observations about other audience members. To what extent can, do these drawings reflect the music played during the evening?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
