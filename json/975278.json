They talked about animals, the stars and social issues. A man called Ruslan D joined the group, who set up an office space for the online group to meet. Step by step, he began to lead young people who were critical of the Putin's regime towards political activism. Ruslan D placed a camera in the meeting room, and when he had enough footage, he handed it over to the prosecutor. The police raided the teenagers' homes and they were arrested on charges of planning to overthrow the government and terrorism. Three years of legal proceedings transformed Anya's mother from a loyal follower of Putin to a hunger-striking activist. Moscow-based director Anna Shishova followed Anya and her mother's life throughout the event and eventually revealed the true identity of Ruslan D.","popularity":1.015,"poster_path":"/mR08InfIvBEo45hml5Zu9ct96hq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120219,"logo_path":null,"name":"IV Films","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":29063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Piraya Film","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":29736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nukleus Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2022-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Greatness Case","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
