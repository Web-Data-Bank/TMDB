Every once in a while I hear a song that stops me in my tracks. This was the case when I heard Heirloom by Kim Harris. It moved to tears. It created a flurry of images in my mind. Two years later, I finally had some time to manifest those images. It's a celebration of Kim's song and also of the power of collaboration because we're so much better together than alone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heirloom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
