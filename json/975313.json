When she finds that she is mistaken, she ties a large red ribbon upon her own chair, which is situated between Mrs. Gray on her left and Mr. Martin, on her right. Miss Marbury is quite annoyed when little Dolores and Helen, Mrs. Gray's two playful children, come to settle a dispute over the ownership of a tennis ball. Tom Blake stops to greet Mrs. Gray and plays with the children, making them forget their animosity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ob9yg2gUfblmCC3QEJm8JaI2l5f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fellow Voyagers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
