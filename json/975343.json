Possibly filmed by John 'Mad Jack' Benett-Stanford on behalf of the Warwick Trading Company, it is a forerunner of the military films that would shortly flood the screens of Great Britain with the outbreak of the Boer War.  Benett-Stanford, an Etonian turned career serviceman, was on active service in the Sudan and doubled as a war correspondent. According to legend, he was shot while attempting to get a picture of the enemy. It seems, though, that even beside the showmen and chancers of the early film industry, 'Mad Jack' had a gift for exaggeration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j0vvAPDTyZ8ksgQPDfefM93Wc4f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1898-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seaforth Highlanders' Return to Cairo after the Fall of Omdurman and Khartoum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
