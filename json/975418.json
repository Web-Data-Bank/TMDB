Looking back on this film I see Ernie Steeles, O.K. Hotel, Virginia Inn, The Viaduct and James Carboâ€™s eastlake silver house all gone now. This film is different from the films I made before .. and the films I have made after. I was grateful to Pony Mourice for agreeing to be in this picture, if it wasn't for her the film never would have been made because she was the only one I could picture in my mind to be in my film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Symmetry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
