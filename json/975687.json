Like the character George, she fights depression by doing ‘the opposite’ of her every impulse. She moves cross-country, has sex with a funfetti cake, and drenches herself in hippie affirmations to prep for an upcoming psychedelic experience. A queer hero’s journey from the neurotic to the erotic, The Opposite reveals pop culture cliches to be Buddhist sutras in disguise, proves that meditation is both essential and hilarious, and believes every animal is capable of change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Opposite","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
