The Druids of Celtic Britain are remembered as mystical holy men, holding the secrets of nature. But ancient sources - including Julius Caesar himself - accused them of human sacrifice, even cannibalism. Now, new discoveries are uncovering the secrets of these Celtic pagan priests. Archaeological evidence reveals the truth about Druid sacrifice and tells the story of the Druids' last stand against Rome's conquering legions. Learn how a recent discovery of a cloaked man buried almost 2,000 years ago with mysterious metal rods has been linked with the Druids for the first time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/44XDqrWNPiBkIT1ixdtLX23LKlQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secrets Of The Druids","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
