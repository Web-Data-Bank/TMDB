The plot centres around Sarita,  a beautiful young woman who has been predestined to be an actress since she was a child. Headshots of her are sent to Metro Goldwyn Mayer, in hopes of making her a big star and thus help prevent the imminent demolition of the Maracaibo neighbourhood of El Saladillo where she lives in.
