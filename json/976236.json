Their three daughters were conceived by insemination. The law protects Marie-Laure's relationship with the girls because she is their biological mother. However, in order to be recognized as the second parent of the girls, Carla had to initiate a simple adoption procedure for Giulietta, Luana and Zelina. The film visits the file of testimonies that was sent to the Judge. The witnesses (mostly heterosexual and having children) question themselves on parenthood, biological or not, on the consequences of the absence of a father, on the difference of the sexes, on the evolution of the family... Their crossed words build Carla's place. Why not a family with two moms?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mes89ufAEF2djm8Yog9aDBWTxrN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J'ai deux mamans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
