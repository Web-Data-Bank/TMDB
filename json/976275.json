Anamorphosis-- That is, the deforming an image and then straightening it using a suitable mirror-- was once a popular curiosity. Henri Chrétien imagined lenses that make it possible to anamorphose the image when shooting, then to de-anamorphose it when projecting. Shot by Chrétien between 1938 and 1949, \"Vues Hypergonées\", as the film is also known, was restored in 1999 by the French Cinémathèque from a 269-meter nitrate copy, for the retrospective “Jeune, Dure et Pure! A history of avant-garde and experimental cinema in France\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f8lzo4RfdtkTVcuGvAabyPMDGYw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Hypergonar","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
