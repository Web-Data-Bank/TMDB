The spirit of Oregon comes from a natural world filled with otherworldly feelings. And from miniature restaurants on wheels, where talented chefs sling hand-stretched noodles and spirits serve spirits. It’s a place where imaginary dust horses gallop alongside real-life rodeo legends and their bucking broncos. Where a journey of 10,000 years is possible in a single afternoon. It's a public coastline where the wind and waves meet a sky full of wonder and jellyfish. Where roomy campsites offer a cozy retreat under the stars. (Cue the sound of crickets.) It's a place where fireflies dance into fairytale-like scenes at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. You’ll find it in our vineyards, where a chorus of plump pinot noir grapes serenades visitors. Where pops of golds and red light up the sky and contrast against Oregon's evergreen forests. And cloud pilots watch over mountain peaks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wgEa9vDvT2xASNppHBUdKHU2Ip9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89220,"logo_path":"/9W5MDec3UgwEjqrHdUre8bq2jiy.png","name":"Wieden+Kennedy","origin_country":"US"},{"id":175361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Psyop","origin_country":""},{"id":118108,"logo_path":"/wvGRDPp2i2ToJi1AFXZYe2JrUUD.png","name":"Sun Creature","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Only Slightly Exaggerated","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
