The holiday, which starts with a beer in a luxury villa, by the pool, becomes unpleasant when Günel breaks his leg. Her only solace is meeting Nazli, who has the same name as her neighbor in Istanbul and is a nurse just like her. Watching Şefik in the neighboring villa out of distress, Günel witnesses an unexpected… murder? He can't be sure because of the hot weather and the drugs he takes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vabWySL4pStUgOxbVAXIKh8r1xd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174484,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradox Film","origin_country":"TR"},{"id":175457,"logo_path":"/5J1p4uRErSYHHLNTRnARyTWkvCe.png","name":"Depo Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2022-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollow","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":2}
