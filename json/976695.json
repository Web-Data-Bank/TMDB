These six regiments would be reduced to four – the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th and 25th Infantry – and soon earn the moniker Buffalo Soldiers. Although they never received the true and full recognition they deserved, Black Patriots: Buffalo Soldiers, will tell their remarkable story of their valor, bravery, and service. From the complicated skirmishes in the Southwest against Native Americans to the heroic battles on foreign soil to the ongoing fight to be treated as first-class citizens, the Buffalo Soldiers served with pride, dignity, and belief in defending a free America.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":124386,"logo_path":null,"name":"Six West Media","origin_country":""},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Patriots: Buffalo Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
