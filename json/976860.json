Threatened by the arrival of German troops on the island too, resist. Armed with a 8mm camera, they create an army of \"nameless soldiers\" who panic the Nazi machine. A film about love, passion for art and the resistance of two heroines who challenge totalitarianism with the power of the imagination; a work that supports the radical flair of its protagonists by resorting to divergent narrative and stylistic registers, juxtaposing the analog creaks of surrealist ascendancy with more \"contemporary\", muscular, punk-looking forms of subversion typical of genre cinema.","popularity":10.812,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Héroïnes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
