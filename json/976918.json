During the drive, they ruminate on the departure and the resulting ruptured relationship. Before leaving, Jack entrusts his car to Wan-yu. Underneath Wan-yu’s calm and almost indifferent façade lies a hidden anxiety and confusion, for other than the car, she has to deal with another more complicated problem of her own. Shot as a conversation in a car, the short’s claustrophobic atmosphere heightens the helplessness of the characters. From director Wong Fei, winner of the 15th Fresh Wave Award, comes a quiet and contemplative piece about making difficult decisions amid drastic changes in life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6VAwKtC3ujL4Eg5gwn5vzvyu5qQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
