Emergency regimes have been established, civil liberties have been dismantled, surveillance programs were being installed and an unprecedented global vaccination program has been rolled out.  Are we doing the right thing, or did we make a deal with the devil in exchange for a benefit? Through critical voices from various areas of expertise, PANDAMNED attempted for the first time to paint the whole picture and shed light on the darkness. It has become a relentless stocktaking of our time, which global organizations, governments and big tech companies would have preferred to prevent.  Documentary maker Marijn Poels takes the viewer on an enlightening journey through the emerging absurd world of the \"New Normal\" and how we can still prevent it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5K3tqqgIdd6oY8YkvHtq1BasoSZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Be prepared to be pandamned","title":"Pandamned","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
