Created while Dom√≠nguez was volunteering at an improvised animal shelter that cared for wildlife burned or maimed in the forest fires, the dreamlike video Madre Drone draws a line between environmental disaster and human political crisis.  In it, imagery of a toucan blinded by flames merges with laser-clad robots, cosmic serpents, spy drones, and footage of protests in Santiago, during which hundreds suffered eye trauma from hardened rubber bullets and tear gas fired by Chilean security forces.
