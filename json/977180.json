While the world reels from the chaos caused by the pandemic, they hold a makeshift wedding ceremony. Then, they receive a phone call...  The Covid-19 pandemic caused pain and suffering for many but also came as a time for self-reflection as people started to reassess their lives. This reflection is what comes to life in a subtle but profoundly heartbreaking short that has a bleak apocalyptic atmosphere due to the backdrop of a pandemic, the setting of an old house full of memories of a broken family but decked out with momentary hope, and KUROSAWA Rikaâ€™s melancholy performance as her character comes to realise her old life is not in any way healthy for her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/591Tk0obtS6pzJVHs3I3tpPcOse.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
