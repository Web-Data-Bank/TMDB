In this new work, Carmen is stripped of her usual associations, including gender, race, place and time, leaving only a universal human figure and Bizet’s oiseau rebelle (rebel bird), two alter egos competing for love. This struggle leads to rebirth and a new future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9HDRyukuQS5fLcZJyMjybbxoFQH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'amour rebelle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
