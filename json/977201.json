[...] \"Portrait #2: Trojan\" is a sublime representation of the surrounding environment leading dramatically up to the moment of demolition. Sam Coomes’ flawless score provides stunning sonic context for the happy ending of the Oregon nuclear skyline. The film is an effective prescription in prevention of politically-triggered anxiety and depression in post-modern Cascadia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ioaFyoHsUt9uAEtoWlIM2RBSx1K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait #2: Trojan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
