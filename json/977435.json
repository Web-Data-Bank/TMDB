The Captain celebrates that fearless minority through the lens of Sadie Samuels.  At 27 years old, she is the youngest and only female lobster boat captain in the Rockport, Maine harbor. Despite the long hours and manual labor of hauling traps, Samuels is in love — obsessed even — with what she calls the most beautiful, magical place on the planet. Her love for lobster fishing was imparted early in her childhood by her dad Matt, who has been her mentor and inspiration since she was a little girl in yellow fishing boots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uwE1N4dSTo2B5i0ITGR72slsEBE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mountain Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Captain","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
