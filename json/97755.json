The killer escapes before Annunziata is able to see who it was. Following this murder are several others, and always with the same “signature” — a syringe in one of the testicles of the victims.  As the gangsters continue to be killed off, the identity of the killer – or killers – slowly becomes obvious.","popularity":2.053,"poster_path":"/7EnGJX7exoNnZkJjuMi8Vz2n8cM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cannon Tuschinski Film Distribution","origin_country":""},{"id":1429,"logo_path":"/n1GvY0KLgk3gcEPO07L7nXncB3i.png","name":"Italian International Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1444,"logo_path":"/1848gsFuV3EGewKg8xWADAyJUVy.png","name":"Cannon Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golan-Globus Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1985-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The seduction...
