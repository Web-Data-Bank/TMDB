The technology of the ad hoc laboratory; scientific knowledge; the complexity of marine ecologies; and the intimacy of providing care converge in the precision of sustaining coral IVF. Whilst keeping the coral in captivity is, dishearteningly, the fundamental condition of Craggsâ€™ research, the scientists and the coral also become entangled in sharing a space for living, working and world-making, expanding the range of possible worlds in common.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Rj6resOavGDACTGbm2EdwBWsNG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For the Love of Corals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
