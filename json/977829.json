Both the killer and others who participated in the attack were members of the neo-Nazi organisation Golden Dawn.Golden Dawn have committed acts of violence against migrants and political opponents ever since their formation in the 1980s, yet most of their crimes have gone unpunished as a result of silent support among the ranks of the Greek police, many of whom are aligned to their nationalist cause. Forensic Architecture was commissioned by the family of Pavlos Fyssas, and their legal representatives, to reconstruct the events of the night from the audio and video material made available to the court.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Murder of Pavlos Fyssas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
