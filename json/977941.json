No date on the packet but it must be 40+ years old! The can had to be opened with a stanley knife, and it was full of rust. I bucket-developed it myself in caffenol & hand scanned and edited all 2000 or so frames (!). The result is this: monochrome silver-blue layers of light, time and chemicals coming together - a near half-century in the making - forms emerging from the grain and sinking back into the darkness. I traced the chemical plant back - and this little dusty reel was made in Shotska in North Eastern Ukraine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tSSL7OCVUEu0tHADUudxTkADyV4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shotska Reel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
