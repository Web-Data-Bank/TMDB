An immortal jellyfish. The mourning of the future we had imagined. An essay on what remains when a dream dies. In a very poetical film essay, the director Morgane Frund conveys an inspiring reflection about such critical issues as representation and memories of minorities. She develops an artistic practice that confers moving images with the essential task to archive visions of possible futures, that is, dreams that have not yet come true. In this regard, film is not only a matter of resistance against oblivion, but also the guarantee of the survival of queer visions in a normative society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories of Jellyfish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
