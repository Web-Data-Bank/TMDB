Taking inspiration from a lucid dream and a carefully studied turtle, Costanza decides to follow her girlfriend on an archaeological campaign on the island of Ustica. The first lockdown will force the couple to postpone their planned meeting and to analyse with different eyes the existential and physical emptiness, sanctioned by the new historical course. Through the excavations and the camera, we witness an attempt to find deeper connections with the past and the place of origin. A semi-fable about time and history, observed through the eyes of impatience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vFtXfz3Mna5Ue8ZUbWRlRgXchkw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turtle's Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
