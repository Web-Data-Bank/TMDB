Instead of helping, passersby were filming with their cell phones. The horrific images won't let Jenni go. Horror and rage at the gawkers' pitiless curiosity take her completely captive. There is hardly any room for her grief; instead, she obsessively searches for the accident spectators in order to confront them with the consequences of their sensationalism. She finds what she's looking for â€“ but her first encounters don't help her. No one seems aware of any wrongdoing, or capable of admitting it. Supported by a tough lawyer, Jenni decides to take action against the sensationalists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vZMOE6NJdyZKRPTKFwjWy0A2eSF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hager Moss Film","origin_country":""},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And All You Do Is Watch","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
