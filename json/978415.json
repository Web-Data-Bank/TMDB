Days spent in male company in the timelessness of the holidays encourage rest, relaxation, and the occasional teasing. But their initial consensual horseplay reveals that they each have different personal boundaries. Ever since his debut film Plan B (2009), Marco Berger has taken a continued interest in queer narratives and in the depiction of erotic fantasies, sexuality, and gender – and Horseplay is no exception. Once again, the Argentinian filmmaker presents a subversive political tale, this time focusing on masculinity in its dangerously toxic form.","popularity":7.639,"poster_path":"/anks5euGzDsvPhbyVem6EqKWumP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matchbox Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2022-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horseplay","video":false,"vote_average":6.167,"vote_count":6}
