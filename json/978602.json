So when we were given the opportunity to film Ben Harper accompanied by the blues-driven Texas trio Relentless7 at the Metro in Sydney, needless to say we were a little bit excited. And it may have been filmed in 2009, but this show was such a stand out favorite of ours there was no question that it was set to become a Classic Concerts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1ohUXQsiPgEaHnaTZQc8BMK3SDv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ben Harper and Relentless7: Live at Metro Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
