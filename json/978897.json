Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch robbed banks and trains throughout the West following an outlaw trail that led from Wyoming to Colorado to Southern Utah. While most outlaws bragged about being the toughest, meanest and fastest, Butch Cassidy claimed he was the smartest, funniest and most popular. With the Pinkertons hot on their trail, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid fled to South America in 1901 in an attempt to go straight.  Their deaths are hotly debated, but it is believed that they were eventually trapped by Bolivian officers in the Andes mining town of San Vicente where they both died in a bloody gunfight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xrCMxaFp8RXGYMFxl9L4NEFClmj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Wild West: Butch Cassidy","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
