But despite the dotin attention of her loving husband, Carla finds herself yearning for something more, and looks for it in the beds of their suburban acquaintances. Her search for a moment of happiness weaves a tangled web of infidelity and betrayal as she becomes the plaything for their circle of so-called friends: Eddie, a selfish habitual cheater; Gwen, his cold and savvy wife; and Max, the smug, woman-hating playboy. As her marriage slowly self-destructs, Carla discovers that her sexual excursions have not only left her empty-handed, but have also plunged the relationships of everyone around her into a downward spiral of inevitable ruin. Marked by realistic portrayals, dark humor, and unrelenting sexual tension, Bliss is a post-modern fairy tale whose characters live anything but happily ever after. A tour-de- of erotic angst from Antonio Passolini, the creator of CafÃ© Flesh 2 and The Devil in Miss Jones 6.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rU3UMw4Om647xYFglqBV7dC2tg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5097,"logo_path":"/cjK2zkmtR2DxHcwqRCXr5SpsLSa.png","name":"VCA Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tale of low self-esteem and high infidelity.","title":"Bliss","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
