A young leading actor saves a youth's life, by catching him just in time to save him from what might reasonably he a fatal fall over a precipice, and to reward him the young man promises to intercede with the father of the girl who causes the actor chap sundry heart throbs and a little soul-anguish. But all good intentions do not materialize, and the young man falls in his ambassadorial mission.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Moving Pictures Co. of America (IMP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Saved My Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
