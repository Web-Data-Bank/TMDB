He turns to Manuel, his German-born childhood friend, to translate the documents. Manuel, who hails from a family steeped in cinematic history and whose aunt was married to Stanley Kubrick, reveals that he too has recently uncovered a dark family secret: his father's uncle was the infamous Nazi filmmaker Veit Harlan, director of the film \"Jud Suss\" - banned from screening to the present day and considered the most notorious anti-Semitic propaganda film in history.
