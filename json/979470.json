In the 1970s she was a militant in the JP in the western suburbs of Greater Buenos Aires.

But his initial intention fails and he finds, instead, other things: an unexpected balance and demand from the children of that unbeatable generation; the discovery that in the West there were almost no survivors left, due to a particular form of repression; and the most important thing: he discovers his profound need for reflection in order to bring to an end the most intense and tragic stage of his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xhWVg5dx5C9maE01AD0c2fr8kNo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Ojo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2004-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time and Blood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
