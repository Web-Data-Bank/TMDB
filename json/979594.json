Berhault's evolutions, in the sea, in the grottoes, on the rocks and precipices, are exceedingly difficult but they are chiefly performed to give the movement an aesthetic value. Matemorphosis is the story of a cycle without words, narrated with gestures and music. The climber Monique Dalmasso also partecipates in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u24ZUmFiljLGyoT9ZNaAFXz7W3G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radiotelevisione Svizzera Italiana (RTSI)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metamorfosi","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
