But for those of us who are victims of bullying, it can be downright miserable. Such is the case for Brad - a bright, introverted student just trying to stay alive. He's caught somewhere between personalities - still trying to define himself. But when the school's star swimmer, Adam, enters into Brad's camera lens; Brad develops a fascination with him that could prove deadly... as Adam turns out to be a bully himself. The questions build up and start swirling through Brad's head sending him into a downward spiral. But as he falls deeper into his own conscience, could a light be appearing at the end of the tunnel? Brad must overcome his fears and allow someone to reach out to him, so that he can define himself - and his place - in the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6FLrCBLcb0IlSie3wm4ZYCOQrdz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die from a Broken Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
