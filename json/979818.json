I wanted to experiment with this film, hence the strange premise. The film was directed, edited and filmed by me and I was also responsible for the base story. A lot of the film was highly improvised and I would decide on what direction to take the film as we walked around looking for walls. This film was really fun to make and I learnt a lot about film-making in the process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Templar Film Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
