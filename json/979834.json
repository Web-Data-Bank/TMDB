His grades have not improved recently and he has no girlfriend to spend his holidays with. One day, while slurping down ramen at his favourite restaurant, his eyes meet those of Komachi, a part-time worker who has just returned from delivery. 'Ugh, beautiful!' She was born in a foreign country, or perhaps her language is poor. She may have been born abroad and her language is poor, but she is good-natured and, above all, beautiful. Wakabayashi, who is single, falls in love at first sight, but the owner says coldly, \"Don't get carried away. She's no ordinary girl\", she says coldly. When Wakabayashi, who is depressed, goes to town, he sees Komachi, beautifully dressed in a yukata. What secret is she hiding behind her seemingly effortless appearance?　A contemporary fantasy featuring Nao Nagasawa, a popular actress who made her debut in the Sentai series.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"小町","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
