She is an 18-year-old girl with an intellectual disability whose limitations disappear when she goes into the water. Thanks to the perseverance of Julián, our father, she learned to swim and even to dive when he bought her the \"Decathlon\" mask. He provided all the tools my sister needed to feel fulfilled in the water.  ​Agua is a tribute to my father and to everything he fought to make Carmen happy. In the short film there is a dialogue between our family archive and the voice of Toña, my mother. She narrates a very powerful experience that she lived with my sister when we went to Mallorca, six months after my father died. We were going through the worst moment of our lives when chance brought us the travel companion mask to remember the legacy of effort and love left by my father.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jgoHKLLUUorBdyUqUe9XleiREJb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
