Young people experience Quebec differently than seniors, who lived through decades of religious and linguistic conflict.  Québécois living in the regions often see Montreal as a foreign metropolis.  Quebec is increasingly the story of immigrants, the distinctly labelled Allophones, who think it is time for old-stock Francos and Anglos to get over their long-lost wars of conquest to deal with the urgent problems of the 21st century.  What We Choose to Remember explores the things that make Quebec so fascinating, frustrating and different.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lCOqKV9BC4Eg12wavuIa5f8WpVq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Quebec is different.
