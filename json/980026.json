The heath meant certain death – a godforsaken place haunted by ravenous wolves, highwaymen and brutal, unforgiving nature.\r But in the late summer of 1755, a lone soldier by the name of Ludvig von Kahlen rode into the heath in a stubborn pursuit of a lifelong dream, determined to reach his goal: the heath would either bring him the wealth and honour he had long sought… or get the better of him.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/2tUoOLeyrqmvW5NcckfPmb3nNMp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zentropa International Berlin","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":8288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zentropa International Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":5403,"logo_path":"/fAz2WhTpoMxutBA92JqlfeHEGuz.png","name":"Nordisk Film \u0026 TV Fond","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Bastard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
