Coley enlists the help of friend and professional model Janine Ashton who takes the lead role alongside Coley’s predatory stop-motion ‘Shadowman’ figure, inspired by the Count Orlok character in the 1922 silent horror movie Nosferatu.  The live action was shot in 1994 on location at Harleston's Masonic Rooms (The Old Mineral Works), produced as part of another film, which sadly had to be abandoned due to financial limitations. Almost ten years later, in 2001, Coley created the animated figure and reworked his footage, also adding a soundtrack to create this episode.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3DtTCvJ0s4Gyi3x131wPoI72Oxb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jon Coley Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadowman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
