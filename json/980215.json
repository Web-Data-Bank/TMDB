As he spies Kitty in a passing ship, the skies fill with black storm clouds, and a fierce barrage of wind, rain and lightning churns the sea until the ship is (literally) swallowed by a huge wave, leaving Kitty floating on a raft-like scrap of wood. Krazy sets out in a life boat, but it sinks too, but just in time, Jonah surfaces and rescues them in a whale that's reconverted to approximate a ferry boat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":125735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charles Mintz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light House Keeping","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
