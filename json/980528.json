It was shot in the eponymous location––an ancient grazing land located in Oxford, England––during the nationwide lockdown of November 2020. Consisting of various long takes, the film examines the relationship between human life and the natural environment, and meditates on the ability of filmic technology to simultaneously articulate and contribute to the (illusory) stratification that underscores this association.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vKjFh2WjKYeKEQZBYpxiPNGVPzs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Port Meadow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
