They turn the city's sidewalks, parks, and stadiums into an evolving stage as a story of rebellion, love, and discovery unfolds. Shot entirely in public spaces, and funded entirely by crowd-sourcing, the film is a statement about the power of community and public space. Set to the album \"All Day\" by mashup musician Girl Talk, it's also an insanely fun love letter to New York.","popularity":2.241,"poster_path":"/dUhB8iF8PqFux6U6ixQLALLMxaW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Combination","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A music video of epic proportions.","title":"Girl Walk // All Day","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":13}
