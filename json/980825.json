Raghav and Najma, lovers of diametrically opposite faith, have a relationship that speaks volumes of their love and connection with each other. They have seen, ironically, dreams of a future together. Lived experiences of enjoying sunsets at the beach, cherished good food and made promises, within the scope of their handicap.  A twist in the story compels Raghav to take a harsh decision, not because of lack of faith in Najma's intentions, but because he loves her enough. Love doesn't mean to possess, it needs to be set free.  A heartwarming story of love and sacrifice, through the eyes in blindness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ILQG2t3gDJZLhQVbQgAzCLHlU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Medias","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Blind is Love","title":"The Blind Date","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
