Restless and looking for a win, he discovers a 3,000- mile rowing race. Jason aims to win the race and smash the record for the fastest crossing. Ten days in, two of the four men jump ship mid-Atlantic. Jason limps to the finish line, battered and humbled. One year later, heâ€™s back with a new team. When seasickness and weather threaten his dream again, Jason faces an impossible task: 400 miles in just 5 days to beat the record.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sUTQdiwUuiuRP1A8fk6siv6x7Tk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Chasing the Impossible.","title":"Chasing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
