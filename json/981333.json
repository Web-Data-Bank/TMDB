What happens when we create a momentum which silences politics, economics and the ego of each individual? This film is a part of the Silent Archive which is a collection of speeches by people of public interest. The project was made with the help of an algorithm that scans speeches in order to find and cut out pauses made by the speakers. Queuing up those cut out sequences they form a continuous silence. The short film is a selection of speeches that went through this process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
