The conversations were held a few years before Eichmann was brought to Israel by the Mossad. During the trial, Eichmann tried to convince that he was only a bureaucrat who carried out orders, but in the transcripts, Eichmann was found boasting and proud of his significant role in planning and executing the Final Solution. For the first time, we will confront Eichmann with himself in full color, revealing the hidden factors and motives that succeeded in hiding these recordings.","popularity":2.59,"poster_path":"/ukCXLa5WTBjz4xpqkSHX9EX5MpR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Confession: The Lost Eichmann Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
