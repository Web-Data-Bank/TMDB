Held on the first Friday of every month, Q attracted over 1,000 lesbian women of all colors, ages, sizes and backgrounds, to dance, sweat and celebrate inside the pulsating beat of high-energy dance music. Q was a one-of-a-kind phenomenon for two reasons: First, because of the sheer number and diversity of lesbian women who attended. And second, because of its longevity - the club lasted for 15 years! Q's ability to maintain not only its diverse clientele, but also its vitality in San Francisco's ever-changing club scene made it a cultural and historical marvel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kI0ljfpGg3MVZoTFLpBnUl30U2l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Club Q: The Legendary Dance Party for Women","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
