Famous for his performances of quick transition from woman to man, Océan also lives the contradiction in real life: seductive Drag Star at night, smart sexy successful businesswoman during the day… For almost a year filmmaker Saskia Heyden observes the charismatic and fascinating Ocean against the fitting backdrop of formerly divided and ultra-hip Berlin.  Introspective and articulate, Océan LeRoy dwells in ambiguity between day and night, woman and man, openness and mystery.  Gloriously challenging the binary yet thriving on both sides, Ocean travels a two-way path of gender with ease.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/akEPxz7A7wtvmXIqzGGP5RvkHqo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Risk, Stretch or Die","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
