The Divertimenti is a sequence of six three minute films made in three intensive years of work with six different composers. The films were first seen on TV embedded in a BBC2 program called \"Space, Time and Paint\" in 1998, which included footage about the process used to make them. 'The Divertimenti' collected a total of six awards, including the Experimental Film Award at Ottawa.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Divertimenti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
