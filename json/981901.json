Different types of flesh can be characterised by factors such as pigmentation, endocrinological condition and toxin accumulation. As the paste is shaped into body parts, those aspects gain more political significance: The pigmentation of brown meat turns into ‘race’, and estrogen residue determines ‘gender’. The truck serves the body parts in a lunchbox, and an instruction video guides visitors on how to see, smell and taste them. The flavours of pigments, hormones and toxins make them more aware of the nuances of the bodies that they eat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Yummy Body Truck” is a fictional food truck that sells ‘edible human body parts’.","title":"Yummy Body Truck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
