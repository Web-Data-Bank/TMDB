To modern music by Bruno Maderna, the film alternates framing of winter landscapes, at dawn and dusk, with the face of a girl in the foreground. At times the music is mixed with bird sounds or natural sounds, in a discreet, almost imperceptible way. The film favors the intertwining, the tangles of entangled trunks and branches, the foliage, all motifs that are often found in the painting of Marinella Pirelli, which are echoed by the movements of the camera - sometimes convulsive - and the bare feet that advance in the grass crossing the frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/47GFG1sFhdVvZOu1lNDy8P908hJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Lago Azzurrino","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
