The shots, taken without a tripod, have a decidedly impressive visual intensity: backlit silhouettes, bright portraits, fruit and shells reminiscent of still lifes. In a convulsive and irrepressible way, with the flow of visual assonances, The little boredom intertwines the pictorial formalism of the compositions with the scenes of everyday life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Piccola Noia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
