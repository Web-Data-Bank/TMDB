But this garden is different, because here the gardener has decided to banish pesticides and other chemicals, and to be helped only by discreet workers, the insects. As we dive into the heart of this plant kingdom, we discover thousands of tiny lives that organize themselves as in a micro-society: decomposing insects, recyclers, pollinators, the workers of the garden work to maintain a fragile balance within the vegetable garden. As the plants grow and begin to produce their first vegetables, the incredible interactions between insects and plants help protect the future harvest. But it is also their personal stories that punctuate the life of the garden. Between parades, mutual aid and attempted putsch, the story of the vegetable garden thus takes the form of a true nature tale.","popularity":0.723,"poster_path":"/4tbp9ECNQmT4AAb2xOs8NqMJtFG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grenouilles Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":24084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Längengrad","origin_country":""},{"id":99085,"logo_path":null,"name":"SWR/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marvelous Wild World of the Vegetable Garden","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
