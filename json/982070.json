He also absolutely fails to confess his love to the girl he secretly yearns for and to assert himself against his rival.  So Flake first makes the wrong decisions - and then to the drug dealer Kim and the embittered wheelchair user Philipp. A special kind of tour de force develops from this encounter: a road movie that leads in a Piaggio moped car at 45 km/h from the top of Stuttgart to Lake Constance.","popularity":0.729,"poster_path":"/uHNg7G9b1CFe7T9DIyr9RCi4nTn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179966,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giganten Film Produktions GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Wheels one Summer","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
