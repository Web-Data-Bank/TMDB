The young Kasperl and his friend Seppel decide that they will track down the thief themselves, but stopping him will not be easy – especially when Hotzenplotz involves the wicked magician Petrosilius who lives in a terrifying castle where he will imprison our heroes. Joined by a fairy-turned-toad, Kasperl and Seppel must escape the castle, catch the two vicious crooks, and bring the coffee grinder back to Kasperl’s beloved grandmother!","popularity":6.405,"poster_path":"/f9PURfU4Z56fvwiIWTZYFk124U7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Robber Hotzenplotz","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":4}
