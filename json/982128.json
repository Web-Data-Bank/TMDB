Using symbolism, color and musical cues (but no dialogue) the movie only hints at the actions behind each striking image. The film moves back and forth between present, past and future and there are twelve characters. It is almost like doing a puzzleâ€”frustrating until things fall together. There is a gay aspect to the film as one of the characters flashes back to a gay love affair he was once involved with in Mexico and there is a great deal of male skin as well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yBtZdlYOnVftape5oK74NiSPak4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Majestica: The Big Phone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
