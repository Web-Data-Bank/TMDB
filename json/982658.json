This warm fuzzy retrospective throws back to the now blissful late 90's when people could cram into sweaty huddles and sing their heads off as they were squashed up against complete strangers with no boundaries.  Ireland was changing fast as we cemented our place in the big leagues and David Gray was the soundtrack to those exciting times. The modern Ireland had turned its back on singer-songwriters but David Gray jumpstarted a whole new era of troubadours as he blended his influences from Bob Dylan to Rave. Ravey Davey many called him at the time!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7NejHfU75Ras6Z6F0giEuMhqoev.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tells the story of how David Gray, a broke Welsh singer, made an album in his spare room that became the biggest selling of all time in Ireland.","title":"David Gray: Ireland's Greatest Hit","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
