But when the war was still on the winning side, there wasn't even a little bit of sadness in the film (as the war was getting worse and worse, the burdens on our backs were increasing day by day, and we had to keep forming a line for tomorrow with nowhere to go (Akira Kurosawa's \"The Most Beautiful\", Admiral Nomura's \"Enemy Air Raid\", etc.) (Song of Annihilation, directed by Sasaki Yasushi). The film closes with the hope of the blue cloud that is bubbling up in the air. Or it may be the last time that a Japanese film talks about war and looks at the end of the war with an unconcerned eye.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jQNLMYSGrx7VtCFpVBdXBASF8CP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shochiku Ofuna","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1942-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Otoko no iki","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
