When her father is injured at work, her brother Fai and boyfriend Tse resort to obtaining a loan. Koo even kills their creditor and frames the murder on Tse. Law and her brother sow discord between Koo and his mistress, eventually exposing their crime and leading to Tse's acquittal. While retaining her feminie elegance and charm in subtle details, Law resourcefully eliminates all the threats and dangers. Unlike other conventional detective dramas of Cantonese films, this film is filled with a sense of community and grassroot sensibility. Sheung-kwun Kwan-wai impressively demonstrates a great flexibility and versatility in her characterisation and performance of this female detective role.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":153116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evergreen Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1956-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Unusual Crime at Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
