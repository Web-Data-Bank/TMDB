Lupus asks for a down payment from the magazine where he often writes with the promise of writing about teenage girls who like to come home early. He then interviewed and approached Pia {Paramitha Rusady} who went to the disco every night because the house was crowded. His widowed father only scolded him but was rarely at home. Disco is a place of entertainment. She's not like other disco girls, who are also sex-free etc. Writing about Pia had invited misunderstandings, so Lupus preached. And it is said that his father then wanted to change his attitude. Pia's story is intertwined with: catching frogs, applying for jobs that turn out to be unsuccessful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mvd07gSYJs10OmnD4Tpr7P0QViF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lupus 4 (Anak Mami Sudah Besar)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
