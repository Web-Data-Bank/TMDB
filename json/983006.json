It is the first attempt to feature the pristine and remarkable Kite culture in the Philippines, with a spiritual expression that may equal, if not surpass, that of the greatest civilizations of the world. As people remain true to their traditions and spirituality even after centuries of war and struggle, the annual kite-flying proves that there is more to freedom than liberation, not only against colonial powers but also against a government whose values and systems appear to be at odds with their way of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mMaE9qWoKp4NrcPXEVKjPINLexZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There is more to freedom than liberation","title":"Taguri: The Kites of Sulu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
