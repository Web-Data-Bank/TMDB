Lieberman and long-time creative collaborators PhotoSynthesis Productions take us inside this vast but little-known land.  New York Times best-selling author Jack Weatherford (“Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World”) delves into the extraordinary life and times of Genghis Khan. His Mongol Empire, which encompassed all of Asia, much of the Middle East and Europe continues to affect us even today.  The film’s soundtrack weaves from ancient throat singing to Russian-influenced opera to contemporary Mongolian rock.  Intimate stories told by Mongolians, from nomads to city dwellers, provide a rare insight into their psyches and the challenges they face in their post-Soviet world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s3JX1f1lA6gOyhVWXOKBJl81JcF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echoes of the Empire: Beyond Genghis Khan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
