In this live performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera, Violetta, a courtesan much wooed by Parisian society, organises a grand party that is attended, amongst others, by the young Alfredo Germont. He confesses his feelings to Violetta, who is already suffering from consumption. She vacillates between genuine affection and a realistic assessment of her situation as a \"fallen woman\", which precludes any lasting relationship with a man.","popularity":0.697,"poster_path":"/scDWPtBmJvHEKqtFRVdZJNUiwve.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9207,"logo_path":null,"name":"RaiTrade","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2007-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live from La Scala, 2007","title":"Verdi: La Traviata","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
