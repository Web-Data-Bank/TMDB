She creates a world of sensual fantasy that satisfies her desires in the sweetest of ways. Jean is a hostess for a large modern resort hotel in Sicily. The hotel is built within an ancient cave, even so, amongst all this beauty and endless sunshine, Jean is disenchanted by her work and would rather be somewhere else.
