Having closed in 2016 after 47 years, this small apartment-sized store championed local, underground, independent, and challenging music to the masses - most memorably with their infamous bi-weekly, college essay-length, new-release lists.  Six years in the making, interviewing collectors, musicians, and store owners, the film has a very personal angle, with lots of behind-the-scenes footage (and drama) that shows both the joy and excruciating stress that comes with running — and closing — a store like this, helped in no part by the changing city around them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fqGVdqo571JwCm3brhNINKK0CN3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187839,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Scourge Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Came From Aquarius Records","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
