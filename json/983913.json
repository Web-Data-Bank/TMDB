My father is a Japanese buddhist monk. He is the head of a small temple in Bloomington, Indiana where he lives with my mother and my brother. My father became ordained at the young age of 22 and have since sat in meditation for over 30,000 hours of his life. At the age of 22 my brother lives at home with them and looks for his own purpose.
