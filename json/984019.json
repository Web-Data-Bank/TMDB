The documentary follows an important event in the history of the family - the passing down of the Legong dance legacy to the youngest, a nine-year-old member of the family. From the first rehearsal taught by the mother to the final debut presided over by the family's ninety-year-old patriarch and gamelan master, the filmmakers capture the intensity with which tradition evolves and is passed on in Bali. The result is an intimate view into a dynamic culture steeped in ancient traditions and increasingly exposed to the modern world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jLyEIMi3RXRXxGqxO2svuQYb8Tv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bali: Beyond the Postcard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
