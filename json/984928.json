He has rich experience in stage performance. In 2011, he suddenly decided to start his personal street mime performance project \"Mime Runaway\". He thinks that he would be more willing to perform his mime art on the street than performing in a static theater. He believes that performing arts should enter every ordinary person's daily life. He also tried to use this form of performance to teach people how to open up and accept strangers around him. The inexplicable fear of strangers has always been the demon he has been unable to overcome in the past ten years. He is trying to use this form of artistic performance to carry out a self-salvation of his past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fFjgM0LIruLghBKsNwMDKCZZ8eq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runaway Mime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
