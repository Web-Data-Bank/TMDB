He hopes to hitchhike to Sydney Airport where his take-off into a successful country/western singing career will hopefully begin. However, fate and his naivety find him hitchhiking with a psychotic drug thief named Boyd, and Boyd's mesmerising girlfriend, Patsy. The plot then splits into a series of parallels, flash forwards and flashbacks. One depicts Ralph’s imprisonment after being framed for drug trafficking. The other follows the dramatic ascent of his career to hype status and the pairing between the dynamic Patsy and himself.","popularity":1.283,"poster_path":"/qbO7wFUPchM9JUsYwFjVbkvdg38.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oilrag Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":418,"logo_path":null,"name":"New South Wales Film \u0026 Television Office","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":1380,"logo_path":"/y4JH9ncZJAFJGYWK84k1dmXnsw0.png","name":"Australian Film Finance Corporation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1997-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doing Time for Patsy Cline","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
