This film, shot in 1986, focuses on a challenge to the authority of the spirits and ancestors in a village ritual to restore fertility after a fire and famine. Narrated by the priests who communicate with the spirits in prayers and sacrifices, it documents a week of offerings, dancing and oratory in \"Dream Village\" in the western Kodi district. The name comes from a dream of prosperity the village founder once had, and dreams are also the ways in which priests are called to serve the spirits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lvM8cwFWc2Yhg2ghdOUMpkIcVP8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Feast in Dream Village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
