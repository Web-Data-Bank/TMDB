That is, until her policeman uncle thwarts her self-destructive behaviour with a lifeline: a “photo-safari for at-risk kids”. Murra isn’t entirely convinced, but she soon joins cantankerous Kylie, uptight Sean, happy-go-lucky Elvis, and camp counsellors Fernando and Michelle on a transformative bus trip to the Pilbara. On the trail, the teens learn about fun, friendship and first crushes, as well as the forces of ‘reality’ that puncture the bubble of youth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sQErzuDbvSxeeMANXi9i9fTnNUf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15780,"logo_path":"/bdQFj7E5yNsir5pMgacux2SoLGQ.png","name":"Arenamedia","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Breakfast Club meets the outback in this uplifting coming-of-age road movie","title":"Sweet As","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
