In an age and country blighted by Viking invasions, Alfred inflicted repeated defeats upon the Norsemen and set about administrating the Danelaw to secure the unity of England. The great king also organised his forces into a standing army and built a recognised navy. Alfred was not only a fine warrior but was also a deeply religious man, a scholar and lawmaker. Featuring extensive dramatised reconstructions and surviving period imagery, this programme provides a unique account of the life of one of England's truly great monarchs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iIlsB0u3StciaBUzG8RfSfaDZCb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alfred the Great","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
