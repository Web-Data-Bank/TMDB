Nice or annoying as he likes, enjoys provoking and transgreding. In the night he goes out to meet his friends in the Kronen, a bar. Every situation can be taken a little farther. There are no limits, no accepted barriers. And more each time, each adventure is chained to the next, as if it were a continuous night. A long description of people: grandfather, parents, sister, girlfriend, friends. And, among that, the obscure will of living every minute as if it were the last one. But something which happens puts Carlos and his friend against a reality they have been trying to ignore.","popularity":4.704,"poster_path":"/ht4wgqYyoHlhtiXAtrjqPvr9Wnk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victoires Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":49691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alert Film","origin_country":""},{"id":12009,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elías Querejeta P.
