Drivers get the chance to pit their driving skills against one another in rubber-burning, bumper-bashing battles. This year the 'tin tops' did not disappoint with a great season of non-stop action! With four different winners in the first four races, the 2002 competition got off to a thrilling start. The grid included top drivers Yvan Muller, James Thompson, Matt Neal and Anthony Reid - all in with a great chance of being crowned BTCC champion. After an epic journey of high risk manoeuvring and paint-scraping action, Muller and Thompson emerged as the final contenders for the title. The drama continued into the final race in front of a packed Donington Park crowd. Both drivers gave their all in a fight to the very end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":212,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BTCC 2002 Review","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
