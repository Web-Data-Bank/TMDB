Many old customs of the Kpelle tribe are still alive, but are complicated by new economic practices and social structures. Cattle divide the town into two classes: the rich cattle owners, and the poorer rice farmers, whose crops areoften marauded by the cattle and who in turn attack the cows. In this film, such an incident is followed through the proceedings of justice in the community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/SH8Y8uf9gAfbVqA1oSKx9FbaEF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cows of Dolo Ken Paye: Resolving Conflict Among the Kpelle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
