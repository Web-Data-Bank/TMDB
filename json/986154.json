John had lived, researched and made films in Bali for 17 years from the 1970s to the 1990s, and THE HEALING OF BALI is his observation of the Balinese response to the bombings and the aftermath. His film presents an intimate insight into traditional and modern Balinese methods of grieving and healing. Among those who tell their own stories in the film are Haji Bambang, one of the heroes of the night of the bombings. Many people died in Haji's arms on the night as he worked tirelessly with a group of friends to save the victims or respectfully cover the dead with white cloth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m7yMIZixDrijOu5sGF6PYivIW5J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Healing of Bali","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
