In a major part, the narrative begins with Kasuya Rokusuke's visit to Kindaichi's office and goes back to the beginning of the original story in the form of images showing Kasuya's explanations, and there are many other minor changes to the order of the narrative. In addition, the following alterations can be seen, which simplify the movements of the characters\r The second Black Ranhime in the coffee room does not speak to Kinji Miyatake over the table, but stands up and speaks to the side.\r Finally, after the third Kuro Ranhime appears, all the movements of the characters are within the third floor, and no stairs are used. In particular, Aki Isono moves in the opposite direction to the original, away from the women's clothing department.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"黒蘭姫","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
