For example, the scene in the ruins of the mansion where Saeki and Kindaichi talk to each other is somewhat fantastical, and Kindaichi's appearance is also unrealistic. In addition, Saeki and Yumi's sex life is represented by the 'dancing futon'. The behaviour of those attending the first anniversary of the death of Saeki and Yumi is unnaturally exaggerated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"百日紅の下にて","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
