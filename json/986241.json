However, with the exception of switching to a relatively realistic screen for the recollections that accompany the dialogue, almost the entire film takes place in a space within or around a single tatami room, as in a rehearsal (reading) of a play. The clothing is an exaggerated representation of the character attributes of the original story. Sakiyo's mask is a headgear that is an exact copy of the head of the actor who plays him, and is simply made unusually large so that it is recognisable as a mask.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"犬神家の一族","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
