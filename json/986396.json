This awakens in Inês a feeling of injustice, which leads her to accept Julio's invitation to join the high school students' association. The next day, we find out that the student association has been closed since they found a copy of the clandestine newspaper \"Avante!\" on the premises.  The rectory then decides to expel suspicious students, starting a revolt in the high school and an ideological confrontation between the couple of Inês and Adelaide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ugTmLgXcHOTTfFbtV760x1dXGi4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universidade Lusófona","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Filhas da Pátria","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
