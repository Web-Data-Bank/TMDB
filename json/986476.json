They attach great importance to the traditional role of women in a herding society and perform dawn to dusk tasks with little deviation from customary ways. Remarkable though is the obvious independence they demonstrate in performing tasks which normally would fall under the male domain, like building their own houses. The film is principally observational with occasional segments in which the women speak directly to the camera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vWKhy1dFPUwbxnSlTAR4iTfopD4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boran Women","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
