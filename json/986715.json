What to create?! How do you create it with computer graphics? The skill of drawing does not change that much when performed on a computer instead of paper. This work is a mixture of traditional cel-based animation, 3-D animation and 2-D computer graphics techniques, each with its own history and production standards. My theme for this production was \"The Transformation of Time and Space.\" I used ToonShader and hand drawn animation to achieve the desired effect. I think that I have succeeded in creating a world that you have never seen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6GR9jk9cvj7ZlXtKOACKIAcy6gx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176959,"logo_path":null,"name":"TRILOGY Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hustle!!
