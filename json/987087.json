There has not been any traditional iron smelting in Africa since the 1960's, in part due to the importing of cheaper substitutes. The building of the furnaces and the work involved in the actual production is deeply entwined with ritual, symbolism and gender. This film describes in great detail every aspect of the event, from the selection of the site of the reconstruction - which is the oldest remaining furnace site in the region, last active in 1961 - to the final result.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/reXqNNsKfvBDXhOavjHpEMQT6r5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inagina: The Last House of Iron","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
