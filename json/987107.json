People throw their bags next to them in the seat of the bus. People buy thousand watt stereos even though they live in blocks. Folk, ass. Halvor Johansson attacks everyone who deserves to hear it - from sluggish Trøndelag residents and spoiled bærum skids to people who believe that a handful of polished stones can cure cancer. He loves to get annoyed, whether it's about religion, politics or naughty inventions in everyday life. Halvor has also been out and about. He is not impressed, neither by air passengers who push themselves forward in the aisle at the expense of others when they get off, nor by all the lugubrious things that happen at spa hotels. And the food around the country? Pudding and grime - is it really necessary to offer people food no one likes? Fortunately, Halvor rallies with a twinkle in his eye, so here it is just a matter of opening the door to laughter and hoping that people will pull themselves together strongly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kyGygDC0rEE5UgCLkD2g3i5rTLz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Halvor Johansson - Ta deg sammen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
