His parents, who run a shipping business transporting earth and sand for reclamation by boat, manage to get by, despite the dwindling number of jobs and lack of successors over time. Jun showed no interest in his parents' business, and the father and son hardly ever spoke to each other. One day, one of Jun's friends is attacked by someone and an unexpected person emerges as the culprit.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/iFhpZtk6ReXUgVAT3AtjP7cRYil.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73025,"logo_path":"/zYb2OfWjKvNlngpq4LemY9JVC51.png","name":"Kinoshita Group","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
