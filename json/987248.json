Wise or well advised, Penélope Cruz then avoided being pigeonholed as a young bimbo by accepting the role of a sympathetic young woman in Fernando Trueba's \"La Belle Epoque\" (1992). The success of the Oscar-nominated film led her to Hollywood, where she landed supporting roles and worked hard on her English, while continuing to shoot in Spain. This was a time when the studios were increasingly sensitive to the expectations of the Latino public, which had become the country's largest minority, and to the revival of Spanish cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7EYpXD7jbcAxA5QPRaq6Swixwb1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":""},{"id":17739,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeta Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penélope Cruz, les reflets de la passion","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
