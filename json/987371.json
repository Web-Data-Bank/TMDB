This film dazzles you with a tale of a husband and his loving wife. Lately the husband (Peter North) has had a great deal of trouble sleeping. He wakes up in cold sweat, with the vague familiarity of a nightmarish slumber that seems to await him every night.\r The misfortune of it all is the fact that he cannot remember his dreams, and so he sets out on a quest to conquer his proverbial \"demons,\" and how right that terminology is. The story unfolds into an ambiguous romance and fuck-fest that is highly uncommon today. This movie is definitely a dream come true.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreamland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midnight Madness","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
