Enset has been farmed from time immemorial in the Gamo Highlands of southern Ethiopia, where women are the main cultivators. The film focuses on Aiye, the filmmaker's grandmother, who shares her knowledge about the enset plant, and shows how it is possible to produce good organic food by using simple farming tools and natural fertilizers. We see how she and a young kinswoman cultivate (using animal dung and organic waste to fertilize the plants), propagate (generating suckers from the corm), harvest (digging up the plant) and process (scraping and fermentating) the enset, and finally produce a variety of nutritious dishes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zqRagUGGkCLnNAzMQRIGDQ8TnHk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Aiye's Garden: Propagation And Processing of Enset in the Gamo Highlands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
