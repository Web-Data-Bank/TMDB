Teff, an ancient indigenous grain, is central to the livelihood of smallholder farmers and may be called the 'cereal core' of Ethiopian national food identity. A local elder provides the commentary for the sequence of events that unfold in the homestead, fields and neighbourhood of the author's eldest brother and family: the cutting of the 'dancing grass'; the drying and stacking; the threshing and winnowing; then the sale of teff in the local market; off with a donkey to the mill; cooking enjera for family and guests; coffee drinking and blessing; and finally the Mesqel fire, an Orthodox Christian celebration at the end of the rainy season.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cjLCUvyqMMzex7cLOVjDb1zATpL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing Grass: Harvesting Teff in the Tigrean Highlands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
