This is the life that Marie-Louise, Pascale and Annelise have decided to lead. Accepted, fantasized, rejected: they chose to put their hands in the dough, their feet in the earth, and to believe in this peasant way of life. Winter, love, spring. A cycle between childhood and old age. Over three generations and 50 years of evolution, they tell their story and their vision of the peasant soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jn04BvjUwyPlSijSy6A0rSkyVhS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les immortelles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
