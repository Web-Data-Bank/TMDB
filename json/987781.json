The five remaining days, known as the \"days without name,\" or Chaikin, are the days of Carnival. These days of transition, which coincide with the Catholic Holy Week, are thus filled with celebrations which combine elements from Spanish Catholicism with traditional rituals and cargo fiestas. Reflections on the meaning of the colorful events of these days are offered by the French priest Michel Chanteau.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sCc5IwzurMcsicn4rDq7BS8diHe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tajimoltik: Five Days Without Name","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
