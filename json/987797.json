The film elaborates on the characters’ private rituals and deploys forensic examinations of artworks within Schaulager to evoke connections between the material qualities of art objects and the ephemeral qualities of the music. The project continues Barney’s and Bepler’s long history of collaborative projects with distinguished musicians in experimental and unconventional settings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3glkm5lCDdoOC1EycgzKwrxwErV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catasterism","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
