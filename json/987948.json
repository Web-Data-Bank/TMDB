Food is only available through the government, and only to those holding a monthly-issued card. Joe Campanella plays a husband who finds himself in desperate straits when his ration card is rejected because it was in poor condition when received. Despite an official policy that no one in that society goes hungry, Campanella's character receives no help.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4n7WiEamU5UAjJkS9bRateDRnCC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And Then They Forgot God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
