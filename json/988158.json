This documentary is not an ethnography filmed in location. It is partly an illustration of the results of former research, partly the very actual investigation on overtone singing carried out in Paris, in the Ethnomusicology Department of the Mus√©e de l'Homme, during a workshop, during a concert of the Mongolian National Ensemble, and in the medical visualization department of a hospital.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cIyEZoj0Dra4kIZC1Y4wB1zwzSe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Song of Harmonics","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
