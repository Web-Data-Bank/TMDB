The structure of the film relies on the automated organization of six different grey tones that correspond to the dynamic range of the film print stock used. The film explores the idea of an externalization of the cognitive instance that occurs through the application of artificial intelligence, and the recursive principles it relies on: the work resonates and interferes with the very system that initially has constituted the model for the structure applied on it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled (Neural Network, NN_OXB_1)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
