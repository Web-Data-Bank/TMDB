On one delivery run, he accepts a package that not only exceeds the implant's safety limits—and will kill him if the data is not removed in time—but also contains information far more important and valuable than he had ever imagined. On a race against time, he must avoid the assassins sent to kill him and remove the data before it, too, ends his life.","popularity":13.799,"poster_path":"/iH8Jgi8qvb7pnBfI8fVGaUbyRna.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":559,"logo_path":"/jqWioYeGSyTLuHth0141bTGvu6H.png","name":"TriStar Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4253,"logo_path":null,"name":"Don Carmody Productions","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":803,"logo_path":"/jEMVaCuEjQ3lzkhakWDKNVjwd9Q.png","name":"Alliance Atlantis","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-05-26","revenue":19075720,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The hottest data on earth.
