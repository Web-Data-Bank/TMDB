In 1990 she travelled to Tokyo wearing a red fabric sculpture that distorted the female form.  On attempting to board the aeroplane at Seoul's Gimpo Airport, Lee was stopped by the crew.  She successfully argued that the costume constituted clothing, but was forced to buy two seats.  Lee went on to perform for 12 consecutive days at famous sites across Tokyo, including the Meiji Shrine and the popular Ginza district.
