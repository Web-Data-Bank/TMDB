Ray improvised the clothes from odd remnants from a local fabric store, wrapping, taping and tying the fabric in place on the model. She stands on a circular revolving platform on a wooden floor next to a white wall. After each complete revolution, the film cuts abruptly to the next outfit. The model is the artist Frances Stark (born 1967), who was assisting Ray in his Los Angles studio at the time.
