The film reveals La Roccaâ€™s attempt at developing a language that is not pre-coded by society. This dealing with the social construction of meaning was influenced by her work for Italian television, where she created and presented shows for deaf-mute persons. It is the very first film in art history showing manual gestures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cSOSZb6CKBDQP06ODWHjrjepsSY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1972-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Appendice per una supplica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
