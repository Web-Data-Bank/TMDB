The elegant Siang that originates in Tibet and flows down through the Adi villages is the new battleground for power. Alongside its blue waters, amidst green mountains and pristine valleys, drift voices - unheard, unwritten and unsung. A series of encounters with the Adis, near the old town of Pasighat, this is a tale of their inspiring resilience and hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":131397,"logo_path":null,"name":"PSBT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Assamese","iso_639_1":"as","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voice of Siang","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
