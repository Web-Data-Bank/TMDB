It begins with\r him waking up in bed and getting ready in the bathroom. Filmed in his home and featuring his family, Black and\r Blue takes its title from the Fats Waller jazz standard (popularized by Louis Armstrong), which can be heard in\r the video (played on the piano by Johnson’s son). The film is also connected to Johnson’s work and artistic\r practice, showing interspersed clips of his own as well as artworks by other Black artists (like Deana Lawson),\r books ( like Roy deCarava), and traditional African masks in his home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black and Blue","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
