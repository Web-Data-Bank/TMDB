Despite the threat of invasive species, climate change impacts and the shifting dynamics of commercial fishing and social norms, Larry and Danny spend countless hours hand-tying thousands of knots to create the intricate hoopnets that have been used in the area since the Great Depression. While they take their own approaches to crafting their nets, both recognize the precarious state of this tradition, and hope that the culture of hoopnet making will be picked up by future generations before it becomes lost to time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lG3JsPwwEba0L3XUDvVcjxeqGGL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Net Makers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
