Asmaral was coached by one of the most famous Soviet coaches, the ideologist of Spartak football Beskov, Sergei Semak started his career there, and Yuri Gavrilov finished playing. After spending only two seasons in the Top League, Asmaral flared up brightly and disappeared forever. There is almost nothing left — no stadium, no movies, no books, no fans, no museum, no website. This is symbolic for the beginning of the 90s - a time when it was possible to become a millionaire in one day and also quickly lose everything. Nikola Prorokov's film restores justice by telling this amazing story in detail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asmaral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
