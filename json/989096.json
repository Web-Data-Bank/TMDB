In the midst of the Ukraine war, there’s an armed unit of anti-fascist football hooligans who are fighting Russia’s forces on the frontlines. They’re called Hoods Hoods Klan. They made a name for themselves across Europe for beating up far-right ultras. Now though, they’re fighting a bigger enemy: Putin.  At Popular Front we spent time with Hoods Hoods Klan as they prepared to head to the east, where the war is still raging. This documentary is about friendship, conflict, and a side of Ukraine often unreported.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oAcKqalDcL4e1r8ZbMBwFcrCJUb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frontline Hooligan","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
