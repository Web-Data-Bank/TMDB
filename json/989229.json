And above all, an imminent entry into the Académie Française. Except that Philippe suffers from terrible back pain that plagues his life. When he meets the incredible Martha, who picks him up after a car accident on the roads of Normandy, his vision of the world changes. With her gentle madness and her healing hands, this woman who seems so free is especially concerned with treating others, even if it means forgetting herself. Between these two characters that everything opposes, a surprising friendship is woven, with the opportunity for them to finally seize the best that life can offer them.","popularity":3.501,"poster_path":"/ksEwgJb0dPmmRCH75HOAHWoUXG1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7038,"logo_path":"/9YDo78sKAy6xxqBwVBT2Vi9FSZl.png","name":"Quad Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forecast Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Des mains en or","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
