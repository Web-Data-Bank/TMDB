Now this terrible, poisonous virus has invaded every corner of downtown Tokyo and is spreading. The Japanese government is resorting to drastic measures to monitor its citizens. People are not allowed to leave their homes, and face fines or imprisonment. The authorities force the population to wear gas masks at home as well. Against this dystopian backdrop, a small group of people have come together to create a return to an ideal world. This film is a touching but fleeting reminder of the small resistance they are putting up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AovM51VYDKeEZPByCXITPx3YrkM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Palette","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
