While carrying the weight of the Nomura family's legacy, which was spun out by his father Mansaku, a living national treasure, and others, he has been lightly expanding his field of activity to appear in films and dramas and stage productions.  These various activities are nothing other than the path of Mansai Nomura, a kyogen performer who conveys the appeal of kyogen with its profound expressive power to the present day. Through the figure of Mansai, who is always creating new challenges, this programme introduces the appeal of the \"traditional Japanese performing arts\" in the \"present\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":157807,"logo_path":"/tyrJOOVAUIxQEJzjP1PhP2H5zFi.png","name":"WOWOW","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"六百年の「今」を舞う～狂言師・野村萬斎","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
