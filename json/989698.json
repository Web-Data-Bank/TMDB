Back at his restaurant, sitting at a table, he starts talking, facing the camera. Who is he? René  Orduña. Neither hero nor victim, Rene is only a witness of his own existence during the 70s and 80s in the United States. A period of nomadism, geographical and amorous, whose only reference points were festive, this is what he evokes, without regret or nostalgia: the hypothesis of joy. And the film makes room for this word, playing with colors and sounds as cushions where it can be properly seated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y3gNZ838lZpQDxsxJQCtTMk0lp1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"René O.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
