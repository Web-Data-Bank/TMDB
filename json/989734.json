Catering primarily to a gay clientele, the bar had 4 stories to move around in: 2 dance floors, a piano bar/pool room, and a rooftop terrace. Every night you could hear disco on one floor, new wave/rock on another, jazz standards in the basement and then chill on the roof overlooking historic Fenway Park Stadium. There was nothing like it before or since and those who were there will never forget the experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fpPCXreK1meJkM9e4TtihtAnOpN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Twelve","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
