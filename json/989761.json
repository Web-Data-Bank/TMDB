The 2009 coup d'état disarmed Honduras and ended the life of Vicky Hernández. The documentary reconstructs what happened that night when the streets were only occupied by members of the security forces. It also shows how in the years that followed Hernandez's death did not matter to the State. It was only until the case reached international courts, thanks to the insistence of her family and LGBTI activists, that justice was served.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wGfJGq08L8FFLJ7Pma0QBmhSXyl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"28 de Junio: Vicky vs. Honduras","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
