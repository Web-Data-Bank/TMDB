On Sydney’s urban fringe, two young women battle for a better life in the underground world of competitive street dance. Patricia, Romanian-born and hanging out for a visa, is a breakdancer. Gabi, of Chilean-Samoan heritage, pops with power. Both dream of escaping the rough hand they’ve been dealt. Will a win at Australia’s biggest dance competition Destructive Steps – in which 60 contestants compete in the preliminary rounds - be their golden ticket? Or will the external pressures of financial hardship and volatile relationships stop them from even reaching the dancefloor?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z8p7sF1VXHbqOCJYZkT9bikbNQN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Biscuit Tin Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Performance is power.","title":"Keep Stepping","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
