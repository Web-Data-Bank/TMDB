Director of the museum, Anne d'Harnoncourt, joins Chimes to revisit the galleries of Thomas Eakins, Duchamp and Van Gogh, all of whom were deeply influential throughout his artistic journey. Just as many other American artists, Chimes spent time in Paris and discovered writers such as Antonin Artaud, James Joyce and most notably Alfred Jarry, whose writings on pataphysics dominated Chimes' work for two decades.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dgouCDmUAHo9UhWjbImIMv40KKo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Imaginary Solutions of Thomas Chimes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
