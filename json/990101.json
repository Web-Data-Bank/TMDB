Though she may share ideals with her artistic predecessors, Murray has created miraculously original work which she discusses with curator Robert Storr as they explore her MoMA retrospective.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4vYTvFuSnZmRRKZ4r40TBJxCiO6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elizabeth Murray: 4 Decades","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
