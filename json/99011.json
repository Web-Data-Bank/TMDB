Nonetheless, he grudgingly admires her persistence and encourages her investigation.","popularity":1.895,"poster_path":"/oz6eg9X5XU7Aq8eVTYoP4Ic6rMw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the truth is hidden.
