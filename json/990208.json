At the very height of the Cold War, with American schoolchildren practicing duck-and-cover drills, the man who Americans feared could incinerate them in a rain of hydrogen bombs arrived in Washington, D.C. at the invitation of President Eisenhower. For both men, the visit was an opportunity to halt the escalating threats of the Cold War and chart a new course toward peaceful coexistence. For the American press, it was the media blockbuster story of the year.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5aHIq5w57oQkLwkQTOiphv6RMAs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":18720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert Stone Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":85750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sundial Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Experience: Cold War Roadshow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
