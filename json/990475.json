The humble gesture of these artisans, stooped over the pavement, morphs into a confrontation with the hubristic act of monument building. For the artistâ€™s brother, the struggle to regain the use of his hands after a serious injury transforms into a narrative about agency in the face of being forgotten, marginalized and deemed of no importance. An out-of-print photography book on Portuguese stone pavements leads to a series of improbable connections. A tour of a neurobiology lab leads to an examination of a Cold War re-education camp where prisoners were forced to dig up stones to create replicas of antiquity while covertly drawing on stone shards to mark and then bury a trace of their stories. In Quarries, Ga extracts stories of resistance from unlikely places and on overlooked surfaces.\r - https://bureau-inc.com","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gcZSPC1vhusGklTXBDU0yh1NZVt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quarries","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
