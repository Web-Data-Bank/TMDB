An orchestrated physical attack, electromagnetic pulse attack (EMP), cyber-attack, or geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) could shut down our electricity grid for as long as one calendar year or longer. Our electric utility companies have not implemented sufficient precautions to protect our grid, yet they are aware of the dangers. Our state and federal officials are aware of the threat a shutdown poses, yet they havenâ€™t passed any legislation that deals with the threat. This documentary helps us understand the threat, why it has become a threat, and demonstrates how we can fix this problem.","popularity":0.978,"poster_path":"/grBcouxZ3xyG9L8gEUwRxdS06nl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177475,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paul Revere Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grid Down, Power Up","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
