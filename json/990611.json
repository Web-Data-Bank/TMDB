The Mask is mediator in conflicts and his decision is final. His heavy figure dances accompanied by the whole population. Suddenly the panther-man appears crawling in his strange disguise, sowing the panic. Two opposite figures.  The director Roger M'Bala, one of the most important of his country, has decided to film the ancestral costumes of several tribes of Ivory Coast before they disappear completely. Being a member of this community he mingles with the crowd without being noticed, delivering the essence of the celebration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ygujPxaMXlgN93FnPBSN6dQg9MP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Peuple Niambwa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
