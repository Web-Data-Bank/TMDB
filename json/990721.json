Hosting the Gundagundo Pilgrims","overview":"The film is part of the Guardians of Productive Landscapes series and a sequel to 'Abraham and Sarah I: Creators of a productive landscape'. A Tigrean farmer and his wife, who host pilgrims to a festival at the Gundagundo monastery, have gained the biblical names Abraham and Sarah. We see Sarah and other women prepare food and drink for the pilgrims, while Abraham and other men erect a shelter. At dawn dozens of pilgrims descend the steep escarpment, eventually arriving at Gundagundo where celebrations are in full swing. We witness highlights of the festival, and the pilgrims' return to the homestead of Abraham and Sarah. Here they receive food, drink and shelter, and sing the praises of their hosts. At midnight visitors arrive with an old, sick monk. Before the guests depart next morning, a monk thanks and blesses Abraham and Sarah.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ujo532ZD82biFRvh3rBHcQkSTMp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abraham and Sarah II.
