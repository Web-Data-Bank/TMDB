They are not as superheroes or anti-heroes but regular girlfriends talking about what regular girlfriends do: career, dating, sex and relationships. It is this purpose for which we approached the theme of this yearâ€™s challenge. Grappling with a stalled career and dating as a disabled woman, the \"girls' night\" is both typical and atypical. Neither of which is especially superheroic, which is exactly what we wanted to say.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9pze2654jUcWw0OqZwf3dsH3UVB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ILY","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
