The film’s second half, set during the 18th century’s feudal wars, centers on a folkloric love story between a Vietnamese medicinal healer and a Khmer woman that unfolds around the symbolic significance of a durian (or “thouren”) fruit, a major product of the Mekong Delta.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wQvIEH0t97Qz2Uy7KqdWcgC2qu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2022-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Rain, Brise-Soleil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
