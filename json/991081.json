In order to market the film as family-friendly, approximately 22 minutes of the original film are cut out in this version, resulting in a thoroughly altered story. Much of the original cast of characters are also renamed, including Nausicaä, who is in this version called Princess Zandra.","popularity":3.589,"poster_path":"/lpMtoRqm2MXypsNSTZkFIgOjoPg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manson International","origin_country":""},{"id":10342,"logo_path":"/eS79pslnoKbWg7t3PMA9ayl0bGs.png","name":"Studio Ghibli","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":188634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showmen, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The most fantastic family adventure in a world 1,000 years from now!
