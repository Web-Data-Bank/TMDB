In a highly emotional moment, a close-knit group of eight LGBTQIA+ comedians take to the stage for the very first time after lock down. Led by headliner Margaret Cho, we see each of these gifted performers expertly work the crowd and get huge laughs with distinctly queer material, while behind-the-scenes they have open-hearted conversations with each other about the unique space they’ve created in an industry that can be inhospitable to queerness. It’s a tender portrait of community that strikes a balance between lifting one another up, while gently competing for the light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ptIPPezEdIKbUzgBarXG1ImMuqr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Straight Up Funny & Gay","title":"Queer Riot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
