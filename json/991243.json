Tora is in dissonance with the high-flying lives of her NRI doctor husband Ribhu and her council-woman mother-in-law Shanta, and thus starts searching for solace outside the bounds of her home. This is when Imran (Parambrata Chattopadhyay), enters her life and helps her embrace life on her own terms. The film closely portrays the lives of Bengalis in London and the alienation that is felt by new immigrants from abroad.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jezqesFI7oUoc7wm4lzeNk3HGcL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18905,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eskay Movies","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":151931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadshow Films","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2022-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghore Pherar Gaan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
