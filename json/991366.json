Although lost to history (and left out of Spielberg’s movie altogether), the few survivors still alive testify in moving interviews to the fact it was Emilie who actually washed, clothed and fed the Jews her husband saved. This documentary will right a historical wrong and shine a light on Emilie Schindler’s dedication and the risks she took — another example of the man getting all the credit. The real Emilie (in a wheelchair) is shown in the last scene of Schindler’s List. She is wheeled toward Oscar’s grave, though viewers always assumed she was one of the survivors — not the woman who did the saving.
