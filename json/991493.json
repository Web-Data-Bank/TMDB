Completed by one shot, including opening and closing credits. Unlike other long-take films, the technical content of this film is close to zero. As a \"drama film\" performed by actors, the emptiness of its plot is unprecedented. One of the two leads even fell asleep during the performance. Every ten years, I would seriously remake this absolutely incompetent film. So, this is both my first \"movie\" and will be my last \"movie\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bsvxjV3bL2yzNY2d5yF8ncBen2J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
