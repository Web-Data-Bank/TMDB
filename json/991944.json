But a union of bus and truck drivers in the Accra township of La kept the por por horns and invented a jazzy honking music adding bells, drums, and voices. The La drivers only perform this Por Por at funerals of their fellow union transport workers. This film documents the origins and performance of this music and features the testimonies of twenty-five senior drivers and transport industry workers who are centrally involved in its history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zmovJnEduo1f05KdWZV1tJNWahI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Por Por","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
