According to Katherine Russel, such a strategy “emphasizes the subordination of reality to form. The picture frame, which has its own autonomy, limits the \"view\" to a simple economy: inside / outside. The nature of the \"interior\" is determined by the composition and detail, \"outside\" there is an unknown space that is never fully described. The fixed frame represents the intentionality of phenomenological consciousness, but at the same time it defines the limits of what is visible and knowable. The static frame indicates the subject of perception. The four sides of the frame also direct our attention to what is beyond it, that is: a continuum of reality defined by a kind of anti-continuum of the frame ”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5z0gerfgsWRHPuu54ouWTfZGFKs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Podróż Wacława Antczaka do kiosku przy ul.
