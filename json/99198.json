These two men have been outcasts all their lives. Alexandre was raised in a nomad family that traveled from town to town, being rejected by the people of his homeland. Due to his physical abnormalities, Ulysse has always been pushed aside ever since his childhood. When a strange murder is committed in a nearby village, the peasants turn their suspicions on Alexandre and Ulysse, because they are different. In the eyes of the villagers, they are demons that must be hunted, burned and killed.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/6nGGTPyCOdNzTwGx1bOTzCbhRup.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20176,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Tonic","origin_country":""},{"id":9116,"logo_path":"/vYeYdFxDWoqBzFgYz2Tf9d2ZseE.png","name":"SODEC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":11578,"logo_path":"/us1W5CytIttX4F526bRJmrS36dJ.png","name":"Super Écran","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":806,"logo_path":"/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png","name":"Téléfilm Canada","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2002-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marsh","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
