He lived to tell the story many Black men don't survive to tell. While it has a unique history, Boulder is emblematic of liberal, white, university-based communities that profess an inclusive ethic but live a segregated reality. The film explores the interconnected issues of land use, affordability, racial and class-based segregation, educational equity, and policing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yF3d0FxYDxe9YbSGUcc8Tjt86ox.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Landlocked Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is [Not] Who We Are","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
