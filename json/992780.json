Going deep into the American soil conveyed in the video game Far Car 5 (2018), the work manifests the juxtaposition between religious survivalism on the nuclear threat and End Time, the digital landscape and archive of Montana, and the historical records and testimonies of Native Americanâ€™s history and movement. This intersection can be conceived as a detour in thinking and questioning the universal issues on colonization, land, race, violence and the appropriation of culture and history in the video game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nLrcpIlJc0Hb7CseOamrfWl37bs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2022-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End Time and The Trajectories of Ancestors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
