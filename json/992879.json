With fierce winds and torrential rains, hurricanes can do all of these things. They can cause tremendous damage and even change the shape of a shoreline. For centuries people did not know when a hurricane was coming. But now we have new methods to predict when and where these storms will occur. Young viewers will learn how hurricanes are formed, how they are named and classified, and what to do if a dangerous storm is on the way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qOS9qwfOceLAc5jejFvw8hssJ2i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreamscape Media, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hurricanes are serious business","title":"Hurricanes!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
