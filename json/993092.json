A lonely delivery man, A-wei, tries to commit suicide multiple times but fails no matter what he does. Through these failed attempts, he meets four ghosts — a smoker, a crier, a heartbroken ghost, and a mischievous ghost. In order for him to die, he learns that he has to first help these four ghosts fulfill their final wishes. In the process of doing so, A-wei befriends these four ghosts and overcomes his low self-esteem to step out of his comfort zone and experience many firsts in life.","popularity":1.538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":55802,"logo_path":"/l1lnXmGse9lO7Pz1Z49SrSk3Y6J.png","name":"MM2 Entertainment","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2023-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Hello Ghost!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
