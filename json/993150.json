He also has a girlfriend, Puji, whom he wants to build a good family with, and to live without money from robbery. Puji advises him to quit from crime and to build a future with his savings. But Mada continues his crimes and even robs a gold store. He marries Puji, and runs away with the loot. Then he establishes a small business by selling cigarettes and gado-gado (an Indonesian salad). The other gang members look for him and force him to rejoin the outfit. Mada refuses so Puji is kidnapped. Mada and Puji manage to fight them but in the end, they are arrested by the police.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zdbwpl00cXdZ3PCmJozbN1k5JW1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161382,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Budiana Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1986-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Langganan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
