What begins as an innocent conversation gradually turns into curious experimentation with a non-monogamous approach to their relationship. But sexual freedom tastes differently for each of them. Without resorting to exploitation, Tomasz Wiński’s feature debut considers questions that are taboo for many couples. Borders of Love explores not only various forms of intimacy but also ways of depicting it on the big screen, since, among others, the protagonists themselves film each other on their mobile phones. Appearing in the main roles are Matyáš Řezníček and Hana Vagnerová, who collaborated on the film’s story and script as well.","popularity":13.389,"poster_path":"/zdwRsbVA3lVDZEHrwHstNdlKoIq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24870,"logo_path":"/blj2QS49YMgKh4SGUGF27uySVRe.png","name":"Endorfilm","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":178086,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Way Ticket Films","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":24701,"logo_path":"/jA4X5Pggj8L4FijoqzXmFOFA4gs.png","name":"Pink Productions","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":51112,"logo_path":"/kWLbDFg6koYqFMYjmjcifeBFB8F.png","name":"Lava Films","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borders of Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
