For her film Es Imposible, No Puede Ser (It Is Impossible, It Cannot Be) Andrea González (Madrid, Spain, 1990) went to look for vampires where the images were missing. Set in a car trapped at full speed on the CV-500, the script is a fictional reconstruction of the ruins of a future in a past that cannot be. Something too good to be true, something that cannot be because it is impossible and is condemned to disappear; the film crosses archeological and speculative means to sculpt an impossible dreamscape outside of time. The film strives for alternative models of narration that respond to the complexity of capturing something that is not here anymore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rG8US9m4a6XLYPjMayk3lvfNrUo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Is Impossible, It Cannot Be","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
