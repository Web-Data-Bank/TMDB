Hammarby Sjöstad in Stockholm became a model around the world for how to design an attractive and eco-friendly urban environment. At the forefront of the new planning stood the architect Jan Inghe. Now there's a new film that describes his work and considers how our cities have been developing since that time. The awarded film follows Jan Inghe's career, beginning with the development of the Minneberg district in Stockholm during the 1970s, continuing with Södra Station in the 80s, and culminating with Hammaby Sjöstad in the 90s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8eTGwCNUV1GKytWY140oSRDOG8t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Other City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
