Paranormal","overview":"L.A. Paranormal follows the ups and downs of a Los Angeles-based team of paranormal investigators. The group is led by second generation ghost hunter and skeptic Vince Norton. He is aided by Max Rutledge, his neurotic best friend and old college roommate. Also on board are metaphysicist and consultant Elliott Szpigiel, the team's technical wizard, and playboy medium John London, a psychic artist and former British television personality. During an investigation at the famously haunted Hollywoodland mental asylum, the team collects remarkable evidence that may support the existence of life after death. But soon after, an accusation of fraud lights a firestorm of controversy and sends them into a downward spiral that threatens to tear the group apart. The investigations get less appealing and the team loses credibility even amongst their peers, as they search for a way to clear their name and just maybe, once and for all, prove that ghosts really do exist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ogUKNL28mFKaf0QN28w8rSJ3AF0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L.A.
