Like many explorers, Shackleton was drawn to the barren wastelands of the Antarctic, and to the honours, fame and fortune that would come from being the first person to reach the South Pole. The legacy he left would not be that of great discovery, but of survival, leadership and a journey of incredible human spirit. Rare photographs, dramatised re-enactments and expert commentary tell the story of a unique man, whose legend would inspire many an adventurer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nM2JRs3uwcTfPrGGY2cm15mOKgy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Adventurers: Ernest Shackleton","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
