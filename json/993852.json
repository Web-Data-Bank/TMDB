Ingoldsby’s poems and candid anecdotes bear witness to a visceral relationship with his beloved Dublin, fellow Dubliners and anything that catches his interest. Personal challenges, a sensitive humanity and a lifetime as a maverick have taught him to harness reality and reach well beyond it to avenge the banal with absurd magic. It heals him as it does us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jiOiFbu4dBWMNEhkqKgiM45dZ6e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broadstone Films","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Peculiar Sensation of Being Pat Ingoldsby","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":5}
