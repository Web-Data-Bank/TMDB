After administering (and failing) his first testosterone shot, Quinn heads out to the bar to celebrate with his friend Mobi. Quinn's anxiety, The Narrator, tags along, explaining everything testosterone is doing in Quinn's body and environment. Soon, Quinn magically transforms into the man of his own dreams and gets a little wild and cocky at the bar. However, after an altercation with some Finance Bros and his anxieties The Narrator knows by heart, Quinn is flattened and distraught. Mobi barely cheers up his friend and it takes mentally duking it out with The Narrator and getting into a (almost) physical fight to feel validated again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nENY2R11hTnmRb74LdrEcCf0xBI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"My First Day On T","title":"Transpassing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
