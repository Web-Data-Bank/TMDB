Beautifully shot, it references as well as recreates a trajectory of images of women throughout history. Moving from the slow, thoughtful effect of allegorical painting to the fast paced impact of MTV, Yoni plays with the structures of stylization, narrative and montage. There is a poetic and lyrical feel to this film's investigation of representing the feminine and it manages to explore both the chains that bind as well as the threads that connect women --across time, culture and history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yoni","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
