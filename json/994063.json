The Hopi, the westernmost group of Pueblo Indians, is one of these peoples. The Hopi origin story has it that Hopis used to live beneath the earth. When it came time to emerge into the world, that Hopi met Maasaw, Caretaker and Creator of the Earth, and promised him they would help take care of the world as a trade-off for staying. The sacred story of Hopi origins includes a covenant that Hopi peoples will be stewards of the earth. After making this promise, Pueblo Indians began a sacred quest, under Maasawâ€™s order, to find \"center spaces\" and settle, and populations marked their settlements with spiral insignia as they found them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tqrVQUuskI6bFHGWeshBkwDthBj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hopi Origin Story | Native America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
