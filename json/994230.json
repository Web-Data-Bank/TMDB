With one partner identifying as a transgender woman, the couple (Alexandra Grey as \"Robyn\" and Lawrence Locke as \"Anthony\") find themselves continously educating or being imprisoned by outdated traditions and opinions from loved ones. While the film explores the intersections of love, gender, surrogacy, acceptance, and desperation; the powerful couple aims to deflate multiple negative stigmas as they prepare for the life-alternating roller coaster of fertility and surrogacy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/60322uYoB7XVvMQspGndkjVPpKK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178049,"logo_path":null,"name":"Louis Jones Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"However Parenthood comes to you, it's a miracle","title":"Intended Parents","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
