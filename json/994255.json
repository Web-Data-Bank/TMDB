Bodys celebrate to the beat of pop songs. Demian shares he's yearnings for the starting new year. Maite, Francisca and Gonzalo do it too. Santiago's streets become the stage of a collective festivity, where many are longing omens for the year to come. As fireworks through the city sky, fleeting moments of shared happiness, laughter, complicity and the expectations of the begining cicle, coexist that night. On January First, the sun rises. Maybe, in the ephemeral -that perish quickly- the duality of the wish appears, as little as powerful: to find a place in the world where something can be said.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shot on New Years in Santiago, Chile.","title":"January First","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
