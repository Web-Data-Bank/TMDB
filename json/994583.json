While the leaders of the group seek to sell them on the black market, the subjugated try to get their distribution among the marginal population who, like them, are deprived of vaccination.  Tensions and discrimination based on sexuality or ethnicity soon arise in the group, reminiscent of past times, and that are the reflection of a society that has regressed.  Desire and melancholy will mark characters stunned by a reality that is as fickle as unpredictable.","popularity":0.797,"poster_path":"/nZaOudJnT6odyyCH1oT7cevlUqQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Almost Red Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":178106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lionfreak Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Equality and social justice will prevail over despotism after a fratricidal struggle for survival.","title":"Water Circles Under Cotton Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
