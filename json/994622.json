It is hard to share one's truth especially when it brings a certain 'heaviness' or 'darkness' with it. Too often we hear that one should rather focus on the 'positive', keep on moving forward and ignore whatever burdens the soul. But what if there is no way to get past your trauma? What if self-destructive thoughts eat you alive and take away all the joy and all the hope? JUST A LITTLE is an internal discourse, a fragile poem, an honest insight. It creates a space where contemplation of one's life and death are allowed to exist as part of our journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hcn9oy7Zd5bDAO48OWkDgQ6RADK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just a Little","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
