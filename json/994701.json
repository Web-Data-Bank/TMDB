This film takes you on a trip through the secret gardens of food forest pioneers. From urban jungles to healing projects in psychiatric institutions. Because nature appears to be the best healer for the social, psychological and ecological scars that people have caused. If we give nature's resilience a chance, together we can create a new Eden. In fact, pieces of this new paradise are already visible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hKs1sk22rMAOTQZvIKwVswS3GIy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FoodForest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
