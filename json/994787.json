Sirens is an experimental short documentary that captures Germany’s coal-fired power plants in their final years of generating energy. Shot entirely from helicopters, the film takes us on a journey through industrial wastelands, thus recalling the passage of Ulysses’ boat through the Sirens’ strait. An odyssey through the dystopian industrial world that has left a permanent mark on earth’s ecosphere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/goSFok4oHCNBRmBf5nEfz6i7Cts.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kristof Gerega - Schuldenberg Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sirens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
