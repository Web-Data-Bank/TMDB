Teresa's husband has disappeared and she believes he has left her for another woman. Gabino, her son, is a soldier who searches cars at the side of a country road, where very few cars pass by. He hopes one day him and Alberto, his soldier partner, will get machine guns to further intimidate the people driving by. Amalio, Nico, and Oscar are three brothers whose stories we learn through a series of interviews and reenactments. Their father left them many years ago, and their mother can barely support them. Oscar has gained the nickname Goliath after the mysterious death of his girlfriend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8e1d3LAvBNzXo76ocPfPfQ8ff88.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2011-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer of Goliath","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
