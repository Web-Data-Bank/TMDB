It is about remembrance, a subject it treats through the chronicling of events and the development of a idiosyncratic way of seeing. The audience is given the sense of viewing these places through the filter of time and the properties of a particular mind's eye. Original scenes are used much as an Impressionist uses a landscape: visual elements are emphasized using film techniques such as animation and optical printing, and the slow rhythms and random nature of recall are evoked through sound and structure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fla.Me.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
