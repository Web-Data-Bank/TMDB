The work is based on a 2018 initiative in China to launch three artificial moons into orbit above major cities to provide continuous daylight. Set in an oppressively illuminated environment, the images show lethargic crowds in megacities surrounded by glowing neon lights and workers in LED factories performing repetitive tasks on an assembly line in a kind of trance state.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tq4CoyDWC1plRHX7F64KrOczWEa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moon Also Rises","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
