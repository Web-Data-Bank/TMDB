I couldn’t drive at that point, so I just took along the Bolex. We left from Philadelphia; we stayed up all night the night before, and then got in the car & drove. The first night we stopped in Nashville, the second night in Albuquerque, and the last night, we got to Los Angeles. Rod delivered the car, & I took off for San Francisco, because LA seemed dull and dangerous.  When I got to San Francisco, I looked up a guy named Terry Barlow, whom I hadn’t seen in years and years, and just walked in on him unannounced. The trip was shot in black and white, and the other stuff in color negative. I shot Terry Barlow in Golden Gate Park, doing an improvised dance next to a carousel.”- WWD","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devotion for Travelers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
