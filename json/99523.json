Amid this maze of heavy architecture, choked air, indifferent flows of the machine-driven day-to-day, one man's nine-to-five takes a k turn when a letter arrives: the third letter - no more reminders. When the cogs of administration are unstoppable, how far would you go to resist the pull toward the place they're dragging you?
