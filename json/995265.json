Nadim Mishlawi journeys through its recent history via a rich archive – capturing a place caught ‘between states of being and fading’. The textures of the environment are further enhanced through the use of an evocative soundscape. Stories held within the fabric of buildings and their surroundings emerge, begging us to consider the way we live, how we can learn from the past and the importance of finding some harmony between the natural and man-made world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mMLQKaKgA6IQS8WelU7v13eQWEj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the End of the World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
