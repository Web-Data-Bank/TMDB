Embarking on a \"conquest of the useless\" things get confused and what begins as a journey becomes a trip beyond the boundaries of so called logic and meaning. Realised in beautifully crafted animation and innovatively rendered background art, the telling of this story is thick with atmosphere and celebrates a renaissance of the unconscious freed from the technocratic shackles of our times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iVgKtL0ByHcerxfxpVuDYKPzJBP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197801,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Applied Sciences Augsburg","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of John Frum","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
