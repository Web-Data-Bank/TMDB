Within a short space of time, the abstinence-based recovery living centre had changed the hearts and minds of the local community. Its residents channel their recovery through activity, from team sports to photography, writing, filmmaking and other artistic pursuits. Among them is Sam. A short film about his issues with addiction is the entry point for this portrait of the centre and those who have benefited from it. It highlights how recovery is most effectively achieved through engagement and community interaction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jcy1SUJ6th1bNiHVjfm4MqV9a8y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day at a Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
