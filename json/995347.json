The corner of the street from Alagôa's house is matched and mixed with the chant of a bird recorded on that same street.  A symbiotic relationship is triggered: the rapid and successively repetitive montage cuts between the image of the street and the corners of the video frame itself produce new textures and shapes in our brain, whilst the sound follows the same rhythmic movements by emphasizing different “corners” (frequencies) from the bird’s singing. The energetic potency stemming from the junction of these elements creates a new image that is almost tactitle, maleable and rippling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nnwTyB43fR5xYfLabZBkwEssCbx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2022-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CANTO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
