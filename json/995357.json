The film follows a woman's chronological evolution from childhood to death and the iconic traditional milestones she hopes to reach in Western Catholic culture: communion, confirmation, marriage, motherhood, housewife, perhaps learning to crochet, and so on. In a strange reversal, none of these moments were experienced by the filmmaker. Ultimately, the disturbance of these images becomes a poetic intervention in which the director's personal experience is intertwined with the cultural heritage of popular iconic images of women in home movies and a reflection on the objects found, and ebay as an unlikely source for counter-file.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7TyUdQB6URSy6wZWN9Jex4CBA9k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White and Black Grafts","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
