It’s an often bizarre observational insight into the some of the dynamics inside the ‘birth of a country’ and why people joined the rebel groups. The people of the film refuse to conform to the stereotypes that the Russian, Western or Ukrainian media have put on them. Come and see how the war began.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a0iN3KaDoUGGDFLhIfVy23rB6cO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Donetsk People's Republic (or the curious tale of the handmade country)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
