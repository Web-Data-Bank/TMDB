It revealed generations of negligence, abuse and suffering, supported by a mass of evidence and previously unseen archival footage. As the case goes to court, the community remains defiant against a judicial system whose attitudes highlight fissures in the purported equal treatment of all citizens. The community’s battle aims to break a vicious cycle of racism and to achieve meaningful lasting change for future generations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jWjIkHwuiFEQ28VpGL6SLb3OGGu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31000,"logo_path":"/uxejt5KOKd0UagKkJ5jMjpZ0w5r.png","name":"Medieoperatørene","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":9120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spring Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beneath the Surface","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
