In the most economically developed countries, the phenomenon of loneliness is rapidly increasing and affects all social classes and age groups. In our movie \"Traman\" we showed how extreme use of social media can lead to social isolation and psychological problems. In the short film ALLAN/ALONE we address the urban loneliness of mostly older people. Like Robinson Crusoe on an island, more and more of them are stranded in an apartment and loneliness. You don't have to be surrounded by a sea, even in the middle of a city you can lose contact with the outside world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
