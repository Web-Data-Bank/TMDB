These modern small farms have robust business models, sustainable practices and deep connections to the communities they serve: a goat farm that produces award-winning cheeses; a horse-powered CSA (community supported agriculture) farm which provides 100 members with a full diet year round; and a vegetable farm run by two young entrepreneurs. Filmed in the Champlain Valley and Adirondack Mountains of New York State, Small Farm Rising explores the reinvention of small-scale agriculture in America, and the hard work and beauty found within that tradition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Farm Rising","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
