He runs into a streetwalker who looks exactly like his wife (if she were to wear make-up and seductive clothing). He takes a second glance, and, in horror, realizes that the woman could truly be his wife's identical twin. After a period of spiritual struggle, Gafur considers this a sign from God and decides to take on the mission of \"saving\" this woman from her perverted and sinful life. Stepping out of his secluded life, he spends time with the identical twin and experiences the outside world for the first time. This experience slowly drives Gafur into delusion and paranoia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3XgIB97QQv70hWLAaljDTxsq5Aw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34211,"logo_path":"/1LJMQNTNMtwwNJSGE8qJ2qTbWl3.png","name":"Vancouver Film School","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dilemma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
