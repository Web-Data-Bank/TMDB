Following heart failure in 1997, his life took a dramatic turn. He was pronounced clinically dead and brought back to life with jolts of electricity. He was in a coma for several weeks and, when he woke up, he turned out to be physically and mentally handicapped. In this way, at the age of 39, Tobias found himself in a wheelchair and was no longer able to talk as a result of his brain damage. From that moment on, playing the cello was a thing of the past.","popularity":0.628,"poster_path":"/5YIQVGzzt5DfhuvTM6ue2WVgb6N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selfmade Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ik wil nooit beroemd worden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
