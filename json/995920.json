Mere mention of the word \"Darfur\" should set off a passionate exchange, or at least the question, \"What can be done?\". Unfortunately, the people of Darfur struggle with a problem common to so many victimized by geo-political realities: how to overcome the willful indifference of powerful government and media interests who find their story unimportant or merely inconvenient. With images and first-hand accounts, filmmaker Mark Brecke shares his experience of the Darfur crisis with Amtrak train passengers journeying eastward on a three day trip to Washington D.C. Their reactions, interwoven with hard facts and expert opinion, raise the central question in They Turned Our Desert Into Fire - Why does the public not understand the severity of this crisis and how can the world continue to do nothing?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5rPN5y59kjZURbIZCdz15itjYFi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Turned Our Desert Into Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
