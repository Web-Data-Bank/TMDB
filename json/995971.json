Lawrence) are immoral big city party girls. After Lisa has a big fight with her boyfriend Jacky, Fanny sleeps with him. She also jumps into bed with a music producer in order to get a career as a singer with the full knowledge of the man she loves and eventually marries, Maxi (Alex Kembar), who is a homosexual. Sandra, a photo model has a similar track record, but her circle of lovers is predominantly wealthy older men. Lisa, who is brutalized by Jacky’s friends, is approached by Mirna (Baby Zelvia), an older lesbian, who repeatedly tries to seduce her. Mirna’s husband is even crazier yet. He is always picking up women and bringing them home with him. When Lisa returns to Jacky, Mirna flies into a rage. Jacky is killed. All of this “uncivilized” behavior is simply a vehicle for erotica, with a sprinkling of violence here and there.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78678,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Virgo Putra Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1992-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gadis Metropolis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
