The author reflects on events of different historical scale, but equally significant for a person. The film is built on the principle of montage of free associations: from memories of the grandmother and reflections on \"the time of our grandmothers\" to the image of Vira Kholodnaya as the embodiment of femininity, and then - at a sharp turn - to the problems of inter-ethnic conflicts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4LZ1moeNwHB413GiBi5fQbaVnWP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hyphen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
