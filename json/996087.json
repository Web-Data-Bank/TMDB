Both like magpies you see. Then as an 18-year-old navigating the past as it pays a visit; when a box of mother returns and a man called Michael comes to stay. The shimmering memories that she once suppressed begin to haunt her; as grief never really heals does it? It simply disguises itself in things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":88645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Erebus Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":151206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anti-Worlds","origin_country":""},{"id":82926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Delaval Film","origin_country":""},{"id":288,"logo_path":"/aW0IpM9d4Zjj978EqgDVSxXXhTj.png","name":"BBC Film","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Hoard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
