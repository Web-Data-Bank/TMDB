This documentary captures every aspect of their short but brilliant career including early Mod/R&B classics such as “What’cha Gonna Do About It”, “Sha La La La Lee” and “All Or Nothing”, timeless rockers like “Tin Soldier” and later psychedelic masterpieces including “Itchycoo Park”, and “Green Circles.” In between the performances, original members Ian McLagan, Kenny Jones, and Jimmy Winston talk about the songs and tell the band’s history in new interviews filmed exclusively for the documentary. Also interwoven into the story are archival interviews with Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane.","popularity":1.429,"poster_path":"/bq1tGle2jYdxsmfdBUw3t99GCcK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3448,"logo_path":"/dcA8JDfnnQPMaq8lv2CCiYrNe0S.png","name":"ITV","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Faces: All or Nothing 1965 -1968","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
