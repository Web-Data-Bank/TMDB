Today, that student is Professor Bob Bechtel who teaches the psychology of youth violence, and who, until now, has kept his own story secret. The film follows Bob's coming out, motivated by his desire to raise awareness about bullying and the extremes to which it can lead, and the cast of characters who emerge fifty years after the crime to challenge Bob's motives then and now.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Killer Within","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
