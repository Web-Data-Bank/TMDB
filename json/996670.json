Upon arrival in suburbia he finds that most of his old friends have moved away, started a family, or simply grown up. Only one person responds to his invitation: Matt, an old acquaintance who has never moved away from the suburbs. Matt represents everything that Alek despises about suburban life; the banal, boring, and uncultured. Unwilling to give up on his nostalgic dreams, Alek parties with Matt, launching them into a hallucinatory and directionless fugue through the dark streets of suburbia. Throughout the seemingly never-ending night and as Alekâ€™s blood sugars become more erratic, he pushes Matt and their adventure to darker and darker places with complete disregard for their well-being.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dFTpn7vJOoMHDadpivfIRspZ1vO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Diabetic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
