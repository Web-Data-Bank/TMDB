The film relies on a number of cinematic devices to bring into focus the trials and tribulations of being out on the streets, alone and handicapped. The result is a striking visual narrative of how people view those among us who are “different.” We believe we can see them but they can’t see us. Or can they?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rVds1xTHIQua09LTVbOfVKZy1QO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spider 71-50","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
