The text is excerpted from Brian Massumi's essay 'Fear (The Spectrum Said),' which discusses the Bush Administration's terror alert color-coding system as a method to modulate public affect via media representation. Aimed ultimately at producing a 'startle without a scare,' the Department of Homeland Security's terror alert system is framed as a governmental attempt to install a self-perpetuating, irrational fear mechanism in the public psyche. The insertion of a soundtrack by Modeselektor with uncanny vocals from Paul St. Hilaire (remixed by Dabrye) seeks to double (ghost) and thereby underline the point of Massumi's complex media textual analysis.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evil.12.edit.b (fear, spectra & fake emotion)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
