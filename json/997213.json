The first embraces one of the few definitions of the word clinker, which is to play a wrong musical note. Consequently, the audio composition is intentionally fractured and generated with mistakes. Secondly, the video loosely borrows visual inspiration from the Italian poet Lucretiusâ€™ poem The Nature of Things. More specifically, book two entitled The Dance of Atoms. As a result, the joined notions explore a relationship through a lyrical yet abstract synthesis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fulD9A9uotwq27jutiRWJ0E0j4b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clinker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
