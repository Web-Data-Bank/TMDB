Through music we visit all layers of society. In the form of a poem we show how it feels when your country is in an unwinnable conflict. Dusk sets the scene for a war that came unexpectedly. The soldier smokes his last cigarette in the window before taking the elevator to certain death. A mother prays for the sons of Ukraine. A babushka at Maidan sings: “If he meets death – may it be instant”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dzvMs0hGJu9Q1i0O8qDyl1Za7rq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Place We Call Our Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
