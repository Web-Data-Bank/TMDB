In this documentary I tell the story of a ferryman that just lost his wife. Instead of seeking diversion with other people he tries to embrace silence and solitude. For this documentary I applied elements of slow cinema trough long static wide takes. With this I hoped to let the audience experience a similar feeling solitude or loneliness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A1Tt3jObvOLPs306E3Vllhkfkpo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back and Forth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
