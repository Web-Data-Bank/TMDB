The gays outnumber the heterosexuals, who rather enjoy the situation, in this well-written story of walderlust coming out and hornyness. The plot has five marines, four gay and one straight, bunking together. There is a four men orgy which is the longest scene and features huge, eight- or nine-inch hard-ons pushing their way out of uniforms and a stream of highly erotic, kinky sex talk spewed from drooling mouths.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wXu3TAul0vChLHhIrHwodyrSwFl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bijou Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Marines","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
