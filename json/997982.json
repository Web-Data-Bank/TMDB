Dr. Felix Kersten, Himmler’s trusted personal physiotherapist, uses his unique position of influence to facilitate a meeting between the architect of The Holocaust and Swedish Jew Norbert Masur. A meeting that could turn Himmler’s thoughts away from the downfall of the Third Reich and towards a course of action that could save thousands of lives.  With battle lines crumbling and lives in the balance, the two men must try to find a way to persuade Himmler to release the last surviving concentration camp prisoners contrary to Hitler’s orders that no Jew should outlast the regime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tZxjBJLoLX0jRzgqymFsKY7ZOqQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Original Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
