Inspired by Rachmaninov's composition 'The Isle of the Dead' it threads together a story about an old cinema projectionist and an elaborate series of huge projected images which represent his memories. He is a 21st century Everyman, whose complex mind is burdened with too many overlapping memories. His individual suffering resonates, ironically because it is invisible to everyone but himself. The ghostly visions which appear in The Projectionist reflect his personal history and private pain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aShjCvlEOzFo90xHrRco4FOzAlS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178531,"logo_path":null,"name":"Much Ado Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Projectionist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
