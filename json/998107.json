The film’s aesthetic, shifting from site to site and shot to shot, offers pockets as a visual version of the bubble that was the Bata colony itself. The characters are all connected to that past. They guide the viewers through the merging of past and present in memory. The film’s colouration also evokes this mixture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cH6FoCMGgCdDSPJph4O3BAnB4T4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Suitcase","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can paternalism survive a globalised economy?","title":"Colony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
