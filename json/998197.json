And there’s obviously no shortage of them. The enquiries flood in, and the cheerful girls follow the joke through by convening everyone to a simultaneous rendezvous. What a divine sight when all the suitors appear confused with roses in their mouths! However, two of the scorned men are old friends and recognise one other – they soon team up to give the witty women behind the joke a tender lesson!
