Back home, she realises many women have out of financial desperation become rent wives for the American soldiers at the military airbase near her village. She is determined not to go down the same route but faces harsh insults and misunderstandings from those around her when she develops a genuine bond with Robert Harry, the head mechanic of the airbase.
