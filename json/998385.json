Throughout his rise to power and political career, Vladimir Putin has been an autocratic enigma.  He was reared in Soviet poverty, served as a KGB intelligence agent in East Germany, and through a series of cunning maneuvers, rose from deputy mayor of St. Petersburg to the presidency of post-Soviet Russia.  Zakaria gets answers to the many questions that surround Putin that have confounded leaders around the world, including at least four U.S. presidents: how did Putin’s mindset move from pro-global harmony, to isolation, fear, and loathing of the West.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vlexG1omTFdajxIrF25wO2nXJO7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fareed Zakaria hosts New CNN Special","title":"INSIDE THE MIND OF VLADIMIR PUTIN","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
