Alvin wished he were bigger, and his wish comes true big-time when he winds up a hot-shot exec at a hip, happening record company. But when you're bigger, you're too big for such fun things as Little League. This takes a little rethinking ... and a whole lotta reshrinking on Alvin's part. The laughs are big and fast in this spoof of the movie hit that made Tom Hanks big!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alvin and the Chipmunks Go to the Movies: Bigger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
