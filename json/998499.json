The core of the earlier teams were sluggers Frank Robinson and Boog Powell, great defensive players such as Brooks Robinson (whose play at third base helped him win World Series MVP in 1970), and the great pitching staff including Jim Palmer and Mike Cuellar. Palmer was back in 1983 accompanied by future Hall of Famers Cal Ripken Jr. and Eddie Murray, and more stout pitching arms such as Mike Flanagan, Denny Martinez, Scott McGregor, and Mike Boddicker. Fans of the Orioles from this era can also pick up their complete 1979 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. --David Horiuchi","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bHtPMWhc57uMLjN6IoJ2z4cdpKF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MLB Vintage World Series Films - Baltimore Orioles 1966, 1970 & 1983","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
