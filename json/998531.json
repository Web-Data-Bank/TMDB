Between the man and this stranger a dialogue is established, the first one telling a story that happened to him with a woman... or rather his quest for a woman, his hesitations, his feelings of hope, joy and anguish. In return, he will only get laconic and disillusioned, ironic, even aggressive answers until he is properly and simply chased away.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5HK3EtIOfKQ7WlSrL7OA5FdJbrc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La confesse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
