After the initial shock, how do you respond? For Marine Hugonnier, it was by using her own weapons – film and images – driven by what she describes as, “a desire to create a common front and a common image”. This is her declared agenda. She takes a two-pronged approach, first travelling to the Polish border and filming once she arrives. Then, transporting supplies to Kyiv. Despite the fact these images were shot in March 2022, the troubling paradox is that they already seem to bear the weight of history. This is like a frozen moment, at the point when the war had only just become a threat rather than a reality crushing both bodies and the landscape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes for a Democratic Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
