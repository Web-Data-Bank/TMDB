Using sharp black and white contrast, step-and-repeat optical effects, slow motion, and an original soundtrack composed by Shaw, the film amplifies the unique, cathartic movements of the protagonist's dance, both eloquent and violent. Variation FQ is a study of the co-evolution of subculture, gender, dance, and special effects.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sGHolqABfLzl0kPO4anuU4XmWxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Variation FQ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
