These thoughts, emotions, and struggles all come together to create the picture that we have of the war today. “Making of a Soldier” follows Vietnam veterans’ experiences. Each story is unique and is a piece of a bigger picture. Together, it provides us a look at how everyone in the country was affected by the war, how they came home and readjusted to civilian life, and how the war continues to reach them to this day. .","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tNLYFKX7OODUVSjDr8dTguC1xTv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178659,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harlem Veteran Project","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Making of a Soldier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
