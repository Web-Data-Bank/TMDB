A tribute to Sandro Penna, this short film, also dedicated to the \"solar\" beauty of these guys, immortalized by the poet's lyrics in time and space (in fact they will always be there and so, even between 10, 100, 1000 years). A tribute to purity, to the simplicity of unspoken things... to the beauty of images stolen from the monotony of the real world. In short, an attempt, through his unwitting complicity, to make a film-poem to dedicate to him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q5UCtJ90k0b93jP245HgZ6wbw4f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Più vivo di cosi non sarò mai","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
