Then, over time, everything inexorably resurfaces on the surface. One rediscovers with amazement one's own individuality, which seemed to have been diluted by love, relentlessly reaching the crossroads of transmutation. Then the veils of sentiment that concealed our tendency to individualism from ourselves become more and more transparent, revealing us sadly selfish and unrealistic beings. At that point comes the \"big opportunity\". Accept and be accepted for who we are, beautiful or ugly ... good or bad... in short, us. Paradoxically, at that moment we realize that everything was clearer, right from the start.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jfc70AIr0V0sy40YoO1FjzG9Obn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Messaggio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
