As extra, writer, script editor, producer and novelist, he is in a unique position to comment on the programme’s successes and failures – and he’s prepared to do just that!  Victor certainly wouldn’t claim credit for writing the dramatic links in this Myth Makers, where he encounters a strange bewildered Nicholas Briggs and the even stranger source of a ‘plopping’ noise. In fact, this is the culmination of the ultimate kitchen sink drama – just what is outside the window?  This Myth Makers combines two interviews with Victor, the first shot on location at his country home in Essex and the latest at studios in London.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aMxj7fROR4aB8RWNvDl2FGi91eL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 11: Victor Pemberton","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
