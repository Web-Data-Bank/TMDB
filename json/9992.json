Arthur discovers that the key to success lies in his own descent into the land of the Minimoys, creatures no larger than a tooth, whom his grandfather helped relocate to their garden. Somewhere among them is hidden a pile of rubies, too. Can Arthur be of stout heart and save the day? Romance beckons as well, and a villain lurks.","popularity":19.974,"poster_path":"/gH27K0S7BiZCsNMxzOQTacG9IZp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":854,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofica EuropaCorp","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avalanche Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6896,"logo_path":"/2Q89KvzxTKB5BAv9RqFIPI1qb7E.png","name":"EuropaCorp","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":308,"logo_path":"/e8F3mQM7DkJ5SfYYDp8FYzPBOGX.png","name":"The Weinstein Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"},{"id":184865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metro Voices","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-12-13","revenue":107944236,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Adventure awaits in your own backyard.","title":"Arthur and the Invisibles","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":2632}
