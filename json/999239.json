The documentary explores the inspirational glory and deeply dark corners of a Hall of Fame goalkeeper who stood alone on the field as the only Black starter and the only openly gay player. While celebrating the historic legacy of Scurry's career, including two Olympic gold medals and a penalty save to help the U.S. win the 1999 Women's World Cup, the film also tells the story of how she overcame racism and homophobia at the time of her greatest triumphs before later finding herself on the edge of suicide following a career-ending concussion.","popularity":1.207,"poster_path":"/gI7JmOOoG9Boi6jN6y7cQwKfgrz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Only","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
