He still has a lot of Amdavadi traits. Raju has a friend, Kalapi Keriwala, a scriptwriter, director, actor, and producer - in short a jack of all trades but master of none. But Kalapi becomes the quintessential genie for Raju when he falls in love with an actress from Kalapi's tele serial. His joy is short lived when he comes to know that the girl Rukhsana Karim Lala is a muslim. Rukhsana too objects from seeing Raju when she comes to know that he is a hindu. Kalapi then tries to make them understand and not make religion an issue in their love and also helps them get married despite the objection from both the families. Hu Raju Ne Rukhsana is a hilarious musical comedy, reflective of incidents that are part of our lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yWKqK4IwOExdkRJ3Dd6FgVSa0OK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hu Raju Ne Rukhsana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
