By combining clips grabbed from different car commercials as well as adding my own compositions, I created an absurd fantasy with ambiguous narration as our self-reflection, to examine meanings conveyed by the media. The background music is grabbed from a car commercial which uses the song, The Impossible Dream, originally composed by Mitch Leigh & Joe Darion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2PwXdLVHcxqXmrjGGeqKZrhDDZd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Impossible Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
