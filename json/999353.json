I combined static video, live streaming news, found-object-based sculpture and scent together to enrich the context of the alternate world in “The first United Ice Cream Assembly closes today ”. In this project, a sugary scent oil was sprayed on several artificial ice cream installed on microphone stands. The static video and the news live streaming will play together. The former is set to a higher volume, but audiences could hear the sound from the live streaming more clearly when the static video goes to a 30 seconds silent transition before the next loop.  The project intends to explore media representations, relationship between our daily life and the media, and how incidents are transformed into information by the media.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8rvSkOfS8MLk6cf1dPcLKOxSstj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ice Cream Discourse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
