On Stage At The National Stadium Dublin is described as the \"Holy Grail\" for Thin Lizzy fans, capturing the band at their very best in front of an adoring home crowd in Dublin. After various changes in the preceding years the classic 4-piece line-up was finally in place. This is the only live footage of many of the classics from the Fighting era. The show’s original audio has been newly restored and remastered for 2012, allowing fans to rightly hear the band in their full glory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nu5KXsvwz5x2UiwP1NKj1btrGy5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thin Lizzy: Live at the National Stadium Dublin","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
