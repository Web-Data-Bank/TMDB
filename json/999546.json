From the earliest days of cavemen hitchhiking across the Bering Sea Land Bridge to Nowhere, through the gold rush and on to statehood, you'll learn the little known and mostly true history of the Last Frontier. Mr. Whitekeys has searched the archives and tells the tales of crusty old Sourdoughs like Buzz Saw Jimmy and One-Eyed Riley. From President Warren G. Harding to Sarah Palin, the wacky tacky character of Alaska is explored in side-splitting, music-filled extravaganza of epic proportions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2LEwqMyA1vh1tGPlPYupsEA5npU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alaska the First 10,000 Years","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
