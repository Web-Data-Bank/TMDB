His passing was marked by a minute's silence at both the Derby County and Nottingham Forest grounds and provoked a wave of tributes from across the sporting spectrum. A memorial service due to be held at Derby Cathedral had to be moved to Pride Park to accommodate the fans' demand for tickets. This overwhelming affection and respect was fully deserved for the man who was often described as being controversial, outspoken and opinionated. His achievements in football speak for themselves: he took two lowly Midlands sides to the very top, winning two consecutive European Cups, with unfashionable Nottingham Forest, in a feat that will surely never be matched by a club of similar stature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4T4A9CRqREGoM51sDpA74Ecp3kg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cloughie: The Brian Clough Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
