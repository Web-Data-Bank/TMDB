Magnificent! Archaic, mystical, essential. To be programmed some day with Pier Paolo Pasolini's UCCELLACI UCCELLINI.  The pace of the film, step by step, sometimes blind, sometimes radiant, a one-way ticket, long before or after the story itself, brings the image to fruition.  Like a mineral, enigmatic, a fragment of an ancient language. It's really very very good.
