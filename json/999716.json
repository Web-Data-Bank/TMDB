To him Mexico was just another adventure in a life lived without any grand plans. A place to go where nobody knew who you were and nobody cared. A chance to drop out and get by within Mexico's flourishing underground economy. When he finds himself working as a 'surgeon' in Carlos Melgarejos' burgeoning organ trafficking ring things start looking up. But that was before he met Rosalita, a prostitute at the amateur lucha libre whose profound beauty shakes his insouciance. Suddenly there's more to life than cutting out kidneys south of the border. James wants out and he wants to take Rosalita with him. For Carlos this is more than just another headache in a life filled with niggling trespasses, this is personal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iMERuV9nko0SYtSMFFpjnduwsYL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"a Gringo Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
