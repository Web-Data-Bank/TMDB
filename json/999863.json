This video is my assignment of “Romeo and Juliet” monologue examination, the character I chose is the Prist. In case of showing myself in front of the camera and reciting monologues, I chose to shoot this video in a very lazy way. This video is edited and produced right before the deadline, however, I haven’t got a chance to show it in front of my classmates and teachers. 2 years later, I found it in my webdisk and decided to upload it on Bilibili and Youtube as a memento.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jCS2u0TKmGWomyEOAiCjYmpaJ3Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romeo and Juliet Monologue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
