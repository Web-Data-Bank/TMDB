A year of work and festivities in the family of Conrad and Louise Bapst, their children and grandchildren who live in La Roche (canton of Fribourg). In summer, part of the family goes with the herd to the upper pastures, and will move six times in the next three months, as the grass for the cows grows in higher and higher places. At the farm below, the rest of the family mows the hay and the after crop, and tends the vegetable garden. Fall and winter bring new chores, along with feast-days, and the sale of cheeses to pay for rented pastures. We see the family participate in a vote for or against the Swiss Army, and at a meeting where mountain farmers discuss whether or not to join the European Union. The film displays the patient and human approach of an almost silent minority of Switzerland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nqlmLdovN0okg8sQQ9TXSQQqX9i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Peasant Chronicle in Gruyère","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
