Victory follows the Fifth Nazi Party Rally (Nuremberg, 30 August–3 September 1933) and shows the then close relationship between Adolf Hitler and Ernest Rõhm. Ten months later, on 1 July 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives, Hitler had Rõhm shot, which not only had the Sturmabteilung threat eliminated but also concreted Hitler's supremacy. Because Hitler sought to erase Rõhm from German history, he ordered all known copies of the film destroyed but one resurfaced in 1980s East Germany.","popularity":1.065,"poster_path":"/qOuJJfgHwjaqHOnDxzTdjvZs9JJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9277,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reichspropagandaleitung der NSDAP","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1933-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Victory of Faith","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":13}
