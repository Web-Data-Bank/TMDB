An apolitical film about a political event. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1988, Armenia has entered a new era of democracy after the independence movement  and the victory of the Karabakh war. There was a  terrorist attack on parliament in 1998. In 2008, there was a nationwide movement, which ended with the murder of ten people. In 2018, people finally stood up again. There was a decisive novelty. Everyone who had a smartphone was a cameraman. The film is based entirely on authentic footage shot by these willing cameramen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85687,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Cinema Centre of Armenia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revolivetion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
