A Solo Experience","overview":"With the recent political, racial, and global unrest occurring throughout 2020/2021, writer and performer, Philicia Saunders, wrote a one-woman live theater show based on her life-changing personal journey towards activism after a chance trip to a Civil Rights monument during a civil rights tour in Alabama, and mentorship by a luminary of activism in Watts, California, Sweet Alice Harris. Unfortunately, no one ever saw that live theater version of the show because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, necessity is the mother of invention, and Saunders knew that this story would educate, inspire, and transform those who see it. Thus came Breathe. Directed by award-winning playwright/performer Roger Q. Mason, this film is art activism - fusing live performance, cinema, performance art and artistic swimming in a hybridized narrative that could only be born during these challenging, yet galvanizing times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rMkH3ksH9ZI6uLvKTwJHhaezYix.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breathe.
