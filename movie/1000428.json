The work, a 50 minute long video diptych, trawls through a haunting, dream like landscape straddling Warsaw, Berlin and Bombay/Mumbai to produce a riff on cities, capitalism and the twentieth century’s turbulent history. Part natural history, part detective journal, part forensic analysis, part cosmopolitan urban investigation and part philosophical dialogue, “The Capital of Accumulation” offers a considered and personal reflection on the remaining possibilities for radical renewal in our times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The capital of accumulation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
