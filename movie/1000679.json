The camera takes in objects, plants, a landscape, bodies, a stretch of water, the air, wind. The scenes are short, often framed as close-ups. This unfurling of furtive moments, enigmatic spaces and blazing light plays out like a series of disorientations, sustained by a soundtrack that is every bit as rich and sensual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m2jZdfk9zl7L1Im189AXos9hz1J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"death by fantasies by mirrors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
