Telling a story that begins right in the middle of Brazil, only a little bit here: in the hinterland of Minas Gerais.  Where a boy loses his revered mother and ends up forgetting his own name, because his stepfather, now the only member of the family, only calls him “kid”.  But everything changes when he makes a friend, nothing ordinary, a fish, and starts to see his whole story with different eyes.  Now he has a mission: to take his friend to see the sea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cargas D'Água","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
