The documentary narrates Stefany's difficult story, in first person, in intimacy, with her faith, her pains and loneliness, in a macho environment in which she must overcome her condition of \"black, poor, transvestite and ugly\", and break with cultural prejudices. In the midst of praises, prayers, songs, music and alcohol, a space of encounter, socialization and recognition opens up in rites of death that for her, paradoxically, are of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wbAu6olGTe7nC62Z8tjihVUF6Ej.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Este pueblo necesita un muerto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
