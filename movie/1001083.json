His absence is spoken about indirectly here, from planet Earth. He was the nation’s son, loved and admired by all. But he’s primarily always on the mind of his little sister Elsa, who’s the real “fully present” heroine in this story. Elsa has lived her life and her childhood by proxy, sustaining herself off the dreams and ambitions of her older brother and hero. He was her point of reference and her daily inspiration. While he floats around, somewhere up there, in the ether, Elsa also drifts, right here on Earth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5725,"logo_path":null,"name":"One World Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":109756,"logo_path":"/sudlIoNIIrKmVWaYD2ZVo9HGogW.png","name":"Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Pendant ce temps sur Terre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
