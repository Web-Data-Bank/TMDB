Meanwhile, the artists invite fifteen-year-old Maksym to draw a walking route in Kolomyia: through the guide’s narration, the map of the city is transformed into a multi-layered historical palimpsest, where Soviet names are mixed with modern urban folklore and traditional Western Ukrainian piety, and “dog paths” are manifested by official intonation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6iKKKlAjQPmrCjzPUZntlEh3Tg8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New City of Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
