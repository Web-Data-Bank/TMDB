Writer/director Geoff Steven scored a major coup by signing Easy Rider legend Peter Fonda as his presenter. Travelling to Aotearoa, Samoa, Japan and the United States, the doco traces key developments in tattooing, including its importance in the Pacific, prison-inspired styles, and the influence of 1960s counterculture. Legendary tattooists feature (including Americans Ed Hardy and Jack Rudy), while the closing credits parade some eye-opening full body tattoos.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":178964,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seehear","origin_country":""},{"id":1254,"logo_path":"/yaecijXtiF2mKiDoxDBOVffJmOC.png","name":"Television New Zealand","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1984-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tattooing From The Past Until Today","title":"Signatures of the Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
