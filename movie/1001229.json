But one of the investors dies intestate and his interests pass to the state. The governor's secretary (Lynne Roberts) engages new talent (the Four Step Brothers, Guadalajara Trio, St. Clair & Vilvoa, Dolores and Don Graham, et al) and a new orchestra (Jan Savitt), in order to make the show successful and a profitable investment for the state. Barry (in another of the vast majority of his films in which he was not billed as Don \"Red\" Barry), who has fallen in love with the first-billed Roberts, reforms and buys up the surplus stock.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1947-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That's My Gal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
