A kind of testimony, alternating narration and conversations where the evocation of oneself becomes a curiosity of the other. There are men, whom by their achivements, bring shorelines closer to each other, Andé Miquel is one of them. The film tells why and how a young man from the Languedoc region in France, dreams one day of the other shore of the mediteriranean sea and is passionately interested in the language and Arab cultures to the point that it becomes a total vocation. Sometimes an encounter, a hazard, proves to be irreplaceable, indispensable and finally a destiny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"André Miquel.
