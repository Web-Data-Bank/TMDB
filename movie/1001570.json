I am interested in the stories the formations can tell of the co-evolution of life and minerals, of humans and non-humans, and their entanglement with one another and the land. I developed custom software that uses sound waves to augment three-dimensional forms animating the geological landscapes. Oscillations work as an audio-visual metaphor for change across deep time and provide a way to perform across an incomprehensible length of time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fX7oigwNShlWDVuM7nKvxJlQf9U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frequencies of Deep Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
