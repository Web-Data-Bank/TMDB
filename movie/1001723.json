During this short period of time, he gained access to the community's activities and produced an unfiltered portrait of it through interviews with the operators and the young people, who in the process also became authors of the soundtrack. The result is a video that stems from a shared desire to tell those young people who are being contemplated to enter the community what it means to face a therapeutic path.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"COMGIOVA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
