An unexpected affair instigates an explosive metamorphosis, and she finds perfect release as a tree. But the world is a dangerous place for trees, and deep in the forest a forester and a student lay claim to a body of wood and leaf - one for money and one for love.  A subversion of Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses, Like flesh is the fruit of a collaboration between a group of committed young artists. The Israeli composer Sivan Eldar creates an intriguing  sound world by combining orchestral and electro-acoustic music. The British playwright Cordelia Lynn is already well known in English theatre circles for, among other things, her collaboration with Katie Mitchell to re-stage The Tempest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3spLnsglOO005lI5kKgIRT7fvNf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like flesh - ELDAR","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
