The films have been directed by a selection of young directors and blend existing Shakespeare's Globe footage with new material shot in locations that capture the breadth of the Bard's imagination, including the Pyramids of Dahshur in Egypt, the rocks of Elsinore, Denmark, and the historic Jewish Ghetto of Venice, Italy. “Love's Labour's Lost”, which starred Gemma Arterton as Rosaline, was filmed at the Royal Palace of Olite, Navarre, Spain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tM4QLaon0mN5VCdN4qgETEZo0ZX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shakespeare's Globe invites the world to join The Complete Walk.","title":"The Complete Walk: Love's Labour's Lost","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
