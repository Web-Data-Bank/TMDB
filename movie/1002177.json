However with Scott's insistence on emulating the latest trends of grime, dance music and dubstep, while Johnny suspects that following in his father Jackie's classic blues rock footsteps is the way forward, can the unlikely pair find any middle ground at all?  â€”Adriel Leff","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballad of Johnny Windows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
