The first clip was the original edit of the short and was intended to be a prologue for the upcoming sequel. But due to circumstances beyond our control, it had to be re-edited and censored which is now the second version. But because circumstances once again changed, it has been re-edited with additional footage and the ending altered to reflect that Laura can't be in the sequel as was originally intended.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hiA6sMB4BtB45VQiHoMesGU3Zty.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eaten Alive: Again","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
