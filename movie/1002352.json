Shots of the cobbler at work highlight the handcrafting process, yet entirely without indicating the need for perfection. In general, purposefulness and the absence of fantasy are unlike Rivers. Ambiguity is thus waiting in the wings, in this case references to genre movies, exemplified in part by image distortion reminiscent of an old horror movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":179150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paul Harnden Shoemakers","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bomb with a Man in His Shoe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
