VISTARA presented not only the great monuments of Indian history but also examples of the vernacular habitat that existed alongside - and the beliefs and mythic imagery that had generated them both. The video is a single-screen condensation of a 9-projector multi-media presentation created by Imtiaz Dharker to articulate the central themes of the exhibition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oPeoYA9F9adE7xdJwmVpO52ee4b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Govt. of India","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1980-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VISTARA: The Architecture of India","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
