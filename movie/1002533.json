The intention of the film is to be in contact with a a different kind of perception. We witness the main character's struggle with her disease first hand, raw. We follow her while she fights against a medical system, which penalizes the already penalized patients. We look at the love between her and her mother. In a way, the disease itself seems to play a secondary role. What we see is universal. It is a film about love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qywLZEwWtxEnGy8yAD49lU5A7g3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"I am just a visitor in your world.","title":"I Am a Visitor in Your World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
