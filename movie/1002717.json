This was the opening days of the Rwandan Genocide, and even though almost one million people were slaughtered, remarkably there is only one known segment of footage showing any actual killing.  This movie is about the extraordinary journey of that evidence as the original photographer returns to Rwanda, revisiting the people and events that he by chance caught on film.  As the footage returns to the community, friends and family relive the tragic events as they work with the photographer to identify the victims, and then eventually the killers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p1Jhsgk4F71ov6DDlLgak4cJZTK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179180,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vivid Features","origin_country":""},{"id":155569,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rwanda Cinema Centre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iseta / The Story Behind The Road Block","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
