Over 330,000 people visited the exhibition -- an average of more than 2,700 per day -- making it the most popular traveling exhibition ever staged by an Australian museum.  Zero One created the animation for an immersive 3D theatre installation which gave visitors a chance to feel the same drama and terror of the town's citizens long ago, and witness how a series of eruptions wiped out Pompeii over 48 hours.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":179241,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeroone","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2009-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Day in Pompeii","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
