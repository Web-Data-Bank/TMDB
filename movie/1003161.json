The slang is called \"elevator surfing\", \"elevator action\" or \"elevator chicken\" and it is a deadly game in which groups of children ride up and down the elevator shafts on top of a moving elevator car and jump from one moving car to the top of another. At times, a child waits in the pit of the elevator shaft. When a car pauses on the lowest floor, he grabs the electrical cable and rides upward. \"Children Are Too Young To Die\" begins with a bloody reenactment of an elevator accident in which a 10-year-old boy gets his arm cut off by the counterweight in an elevator shaft. The story unfolds and reveals real issues and deaths resulting from such dangerous activities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/69WWjJxX3Wxvvms2AlNTQJThB7B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179242,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cerutti Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children Are Too Young to Die","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
