This stunning production at Milan's La Scala unites four luminaries of today's opera scene to great effect: with his lilting legato, Marcelo √Ålvarez (Manrico) does justice to the opera's bel canto character; Franco Vassallo brings assurance and flair to the Count di Luna; Maria Agresta (Leonora) effortlessly rises to the challenges of the score; and Ekaterina Semenchuk (Azucena) also masters the most difficult notes. With the fastidious Daniele Rustioni leading La Scala's world-class orchestra, the music leads the action apace, resounding alongside the hall's legendary chorus and amid monumental sets and decor in this sublime production of one of the world's favorite operas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/msIBYn4Ps0TtfQ1VLrbE6yP3MrX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Trovatore (La Scala)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
