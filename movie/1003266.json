This gave him the perfect excuse to eliminate several political enemies and tighten his grip on a tumultuous nation. This episode covers Napoleon's golden era - his rise to Emperor in 1804 and his remarkable military victories at Austerlitz, Eylau and Ulm. By 1808 the Emperor of France was just a short step away from becoming the Emperor of Europe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gEVg6G0M6gnZNkIKc0EZ0oUcjDV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Napoleon: Imperial Zenith","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
