No other actor made such a lasting contribution to the programme or influenced it so greatly.  In this special Myth Makers, Nicholas Briggs meets William’s friends, colleagues and family and explores the personality of this shy, complex and private man.  With contributions from William Russell, Carole Ann Ford, Maureen O’Brien, Peter Purves, Verity Lambert, Michael Craze, Anneke Wills, Donald Tosh, Christopher Barry and a revealing interview with Jack Pitt, who was an extra in Doctor Who and shared William’s flat in London.  Also featured is Jessica Carney, who has written a biography of the grandfather’s life titled Who’s There?  This is not just a Myth Makers tribute… it’s almost a chance to meet the man himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fWykbXurla9jL8Wl7C8mFeuxMIZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 43: William Hartnell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
