Almost unnoticed by fandom in general, Dan Harris has been quietly organising cruises around the coast of America with fans and stars from Doctor Who. This must surely be the most obscure and unique fan activity of all!  Join the intrepid Reeltime crew as we board the good ship Fascination with Nicholas Courtney, Yee Jee Tso and Lisa Bowerman as it leaves Miami on it’s way across the Gulf of Mexico.  Somehow in this totally unique video (between trips on a glass bottom boat and to the Mayan ruins at Tulum) we manage to… squeeze in a Writers Workshop with Gary Russell, Stephen Cole and Simon Gerard… chat to the stars and fans about why they signed up… and include highlights of previous cruises.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6nCSw7TacIPwvEk68Gv2L5ila5H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor at Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
