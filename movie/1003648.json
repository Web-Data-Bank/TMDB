Janie is the only employee and she’s been stuck out here for longer than she cares to admit- and she’s drinking more than she’s willing to admit, yet frankly who cares anymore? Ed can’t pass the Tesco quiz, he can’t go out in the rain without his cag in a bag, he can’t drive and he can’t help who he’s related to. But at least he’s got a new job... at Bobby’s Caravan park. Hopes, dreams, and families collide in this searing, tender yet funny play that asks what it means to process our past and the traumas that lie within.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bEQ0WiktHe0e4GdURNeI7OtcFY6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Original Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
