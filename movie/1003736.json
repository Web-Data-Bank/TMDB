It is a memorial trace of childhood. Some fog, dead trees, dwellings, a few piano keys, abandoned boats. It is a dreamlike, fluid poem which contemplates a mental landscape and an absence within a tangible organic cycle. It is a proportionless sensory journey. It is a bitter-tasting portrait-in-time of an intoxicating beauty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/21e8WLBsnsqWwMVcbRO8ooWGVdS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1985","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
