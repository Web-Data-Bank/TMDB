Shelagh Delaneyâ€™s taboo-breaking play, written when she was just 19, was later adapted into a BAFTA award-winning film.  When her mother Helen runs off with a car salesman, feisty teenager Jo takes up with Jimmie, a sailor who promises to marry her, before he heads for the seas. Art student Geof moves in and assumes the role of surrogate parent until, misguidedly, he sends for Helen and their unconventional setup unravels.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kTQXynsSMzqegrWpAFC5tv50mSi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16355,"logo_path":"/tWuPpLrD2urqKPXIit4VLTHWvgK.png","name":"National Theatre","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-29","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Theatre: A Taste of Honey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
