On a long rainy afternoon, employees Sam and Willie practise their steps for the finals of the ballroom dancing championship.  Hally arrives from school to hide out in his parents’ tea room. These two men have been unlikely best friends to Hally his whole life. But it is apartheid era South Africa: he’s Master Harold, and they are the boys.
