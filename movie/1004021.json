A young woman calls to him from a love seat on the front porch of a large house across the street. She's barefoot, sucking on a watermelon lollipop. He goes over to her and the verbal fencing begins. It looks like it's headed for a kiss, but he's going steady with someone else and she may not be exactly what she seems. By the end, someone has to weigh conflicting information and make an important spring-day decision.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
