It is an exploration of the courage of the Ukrainian people, fiercely determined to stand their ground until ‘the last drop of blood’. Demonstrating an astounding ability to unite as a people and defend the sovereignty of their country, Ukrainians show compassion and resilience even when surrounded by death, destruction, and unfathomable war crimes. The film transports viewers through a war that started immediately after Maidan (Revolution of Dignity) in 2014 and continues through the 2022 Russian invasion. Through personal stories of civilians, children, soldiers, doctors, the country’s elderly, journalists, religious leaders, and international volunteers, this is a humanising diary of millions of people whose lives were turned upside down by eight years of conflict.","popularity":1.235,"poster_path":"/ueSMMu6eDwye6L4WnKAUfcWmJ66.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182080,"logo_path":null,"name":"Winter on Fire production","origin_country":""},{"id":4183,"logo_path":"/bPOaJehJ43bEq1sip5jE1G53IEE.png","name":"Diamond Docs","origin_country":"US"},{"id":182081,"logo_path":null,"name":"Donbas Frontliner","origin_country":""},{"id":182082,"logo_path":null,"name":"Donetsk Institute of Information","origin_country":""},{"id":182083,"logo_path":"/45d65QyeZKGndisJML5BvikXkdU.png","name":"MakeMake Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom on Fire: Ukraine's Fight For Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
