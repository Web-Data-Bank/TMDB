These are ingredients for revolution, and Bobi Wine and his wife Barbie Kyagulanyi are stirring the pot. When the charismatic Bobi, a musician and member of parliament, announces his campaign for president, Uganda’s youth are ecstatic, filling parks and streets for every speech, and singing Bobi’s anthems of peace and freedom. But then comes the crackdown, orchestrated by Yoweri Museveni, a brutal dictator who has ruled Uganda for 36 years. Bobi and his crew survive arrests, beatings, torture, riots and raids.","popularity":1.533,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":181688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southern Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":138301,"logo_path":"/kjYLNBezs8z364sgZDi2qHDEMb3.png","name":"Ventureland","origin_country":"US"},{"id":169390,"logo_path":"/7lVENvcyaElJiO75OHvg8MqOOrH.png","name":"Quiet","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UG","name":"Uganda"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobi Wine: Ghetto President","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
