It is about a dark and difficult masterpiece and the deeply gifted and flawed people who made it. It is about New York in a troubled era of cultural ferment and social change. It is about an era that made a movie and a movie that made an era. The 1969 movie tells the story of two homeless loners who join forces out of desperation and struggle to survive.","popularity":1.772,"poster_path":"/1ActCe9sxmgVq67eH3pNHtBKtv0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Augusta Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":153886,"logo_path":"/wcOgb8591a6a506L1bUqxEiRv1B.png","name":"Foothill Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":32205,"logo_path":"/dQmrjj3YjGoXlulrQu6IHPf5Vmj.png","name":"Cineflix Productions","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":66478,"logo_path":"/u7WmMkfo9MqsqfD5cuDAbd0u1qY.png","name":"Artemis Rising","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desperate Souls, Dark City and the Legend of Midnight Cowboy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
