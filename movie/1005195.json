She has uniforms made and hires a veteran of the Spanish-American War to teach her \"cadets\" military routines and drills. Her father owns a munitions factory and is always telling her to be on the lookout for spies. She convinces herself that the family butler, Williams, is a spy because he cuts his grapefruit in an odd way.
