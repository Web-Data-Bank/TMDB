Their stories were never told as they died during their service. Through a narration based on their haunting diaries, the film depicts their inner turmoil. It interweaves first-hand military images, key moments from childhood until enlistment and home videos of the deceased soldiers whose stories are silenced and seen as a national threat.","popularity":0.972,"poster_path":"/2XRZd4RI3X3xPqOoeJf51ggt2oX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168486,"logo_path":"/wJIDzf771eSmtSRjBMi8vJBWz8t.png","name":"Real Lava","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":98581,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medalia Productions","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":45230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danish Documentary","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":5974,"logo_path":"/vgPUbUDwVGL1ruiPv2KFtjh75UD.png","name":"Making Movies","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":91291,"logo_path":"/xy2KPzjdztf17Bwrp3ZuQqpxPax.png","name":"Sagafilm","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":88976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guy DVD Films","origin_country":""},{"id":29725,"logo_path":"/6PJrEn8WR7RQzbwv6vGoEvxg6Dh.png","name":"HOT","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":151488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Channel 8 Hot","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Innocence","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
