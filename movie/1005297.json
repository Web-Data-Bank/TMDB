Director Annina Furrer traces our need for deep, lifelong connection in marriage and partnership and examines the widespread desire and claim for sexual fidelity. In doing so, she encounters a reality full of slips, flings and secret love affairs, in a world of dreams, longings and fantasies. How it is that practically all couples hold the concept of fidelity so dear and yet a surprisingly large number do not adhere to it? If we really want to love and grow old together, shouldn't we perhaps leave behind entrenched ways of thinking? Overcome inveterate possessiveness and strive for a new concept of fidelity? A fidelity that is not necessarily understood as sexual fidelity, but as trust, tenderness, honesty and freedom that we give each other as lovers?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/76ohTeh4bygiFChTLyYFIaOxP0N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lomotion","origin_country":""},{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about love – in a world full of slips, flings and secret love affairs.","title":"Of Loving and Lying","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
