Over the last couple of years, he has developed a relationship with a deaf and mute woman, Ladan. The construction site on which he works today turns out to be the set of a film about the atrocities committed by Hitler during WWII. Against all odds, he is given a movie role, a house and a chance at being somebody. When Ladan learns about this, she comes to his workplace begging for help. Shakib’s scheme to hide her goes tragically wrong and threatens to ruin his newfound status and what seemed to be the opportunity of a lifetime.","popularity":2.343,"poster_path":"/pjR1n7gHasF9bsUgSE0CLRiDD7Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79223,"logo_path":"/4oiwax9MsCkAVpPe9oasfL3r2hF.png","name":"Iranian Independents","origin_country":"IR"},{"id":182132,"logo_path":"/e75dmk9DbTEuxf0g6evY0yp0HUA.png","name":"Namava","origin_country":"IR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2023-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World War III","video":false,"vote_average":6.778,"vote_count":9}
