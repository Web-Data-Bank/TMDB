He provides housing and jobs for the locals but will ruthlessly execute anyone who dares to oppose him. This is the lesson the pauper Arzu is about to learn first-hand—his wife Karina has informed the police about the crimes that are taking place there. Arzu is a cripple; now he must raise his little daughter alone. He is so helpless and grief-stricken that he doesn’t even seem to be contemplating revenge. Poshaev takes him under his wing and offers him the position of a guard at a building site. Soon Arzu has a chance to prove his loyalty, and he becomes Poshaev’s right hand. But where do Arzu’s real loyalties lie—with his boss or with the idea of justice?","popularity":1.171,"poster_path":"/83Cpqj8el8UIoAXhW4zXCdKwoww.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3623,"logo_path":"/v3XJT8ci1OScqcMOqd6uAExJCcV.png","name":"Kazakhfilm Studios","origin_country":"KZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goliath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
