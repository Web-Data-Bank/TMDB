First for her identity, today as a social worker and “mom” of the Neapolitan femminielli. At 60, she has no intention of slowing down.  For 21 years she has suffered prostitution on the sidewalks of Naples, a city that for centuries has been home to one of the most numerous transgender communities in the world, yet still strongly discriminated against. Loredana, along with her transgender rights group Associazione Trans Napoli, fights for the femminielli rights and she raises her voice when these are trampled. Loredana doesn’t allow anyone to silence her even when it comes to politics: Italy must obtain a law against homobitransphobia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jXBDEEAs6NL7Y9WusCKCuvJxgMn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loredana’s Fight Against Transphobia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
