If a fourth is to be expected, he or she must be born, however, one of them must then be killed, giving the females priority for sacrifice. Zoe, Iris and Clio are three sisters, but one of them will soon be killed. Tria is a tragic story, suspended between life and death, set in the home of a family that has accepted to sacrifice its integrity in order to carve out a place in the world. A dystopian story, yet not so far from what could happen, or what, somewhere else, may have already happened.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hhdEWxxXxCFCCK7AirTcMwz2Aw7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lupin Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":182226,"logo_path":null,"name":"Piece of Cake","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TRIA","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
