The singular artistic vision of Sergio Leone has transcended national borders, creating the Spaghetti Western genre and transforming the international cinematic panorama forever with his innovative stylistic and narrative solutions, which have now become part of the language of the movies. The film, which is enriched with precious archive footage from the Cineteca di Bologna, including rare audio recordings and film clips shot behind the scenes, sees for the first time the direct participation of the Leone family and has interviews both with Leone’s longtime collaborators and with icons of Hollywood who have been profoundly influenced by his work.","popularity":4.231,"poster_path":"/aCKJgQ4pA68AadCzvGsngWQLHeV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135346,"logo_path":"/hIwjhVdOOQ1fpdebwOuDQD7bnw0.png","name":"Sky Studios","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":53597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sky Italia","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":176106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leone Film Group","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sergio Leone: The Italian Who Invented America","video":false,"vote_average":7.188,"vote_count":32}
