They are two artists who have lived in the same building for years, but now she’s moving to another neighborhood. They get to work on a new project inspired by Federico Fellini’s Ginger and Fred, and bring in Emanuele, Monica, Francesco, Martina, and Andrea. First, tap dancing classes, as the script comes together one day at a time, with rehearsals in Rome, Rimini and France, in theaters shut down by Covid-19. Euphoria is running high, despite the uncertain times, and our theater troupe starts to resemble a gaggle of shipwreck survivors, bewildered by the way real life gets confounded with what is tentatively shaping up as the stage production.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/udd1F4hLSaryOlAVQWvuiTKZZ41.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ubulibri","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We're Here to Try","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
