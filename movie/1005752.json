His proposal comes when I tell him I'm moving out of his house. So we started filming, me with my camera and he with his. Although we have lived together for more than 20 years, it is through the camera that we see each other like never before. That Breath is an intimate record of our bond, love and loss, in search of understanding what it means to be alive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/daHH2pk7b0xz74PO5HUzD6SqXnl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113561,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monarca Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2022-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
