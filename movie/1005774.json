This sets in motion a series of catastrophic consequences, in a spell-binding film of emotions, humour, and tragic role reversals that puts ancient beliefs and customs on trial in an ever increasingly post-modern and Western world.","popularity":4.453,"poster_path":"/6lvUZgY23Emak4VjFy8VXiDjuVF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180943,"logo_path":"/9rlSVKVlqpAGDh2QItGPENiv7Iz.png","name":"EbonyLife Studios","origin_country":"NG"},{"id":71025,"logo_path":"/ztZVgCr9gw4m6ceBe3HagXWvv8q.png","name":"EbonyLife Films","origin_country":"NG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"}],"release_date":"2022-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Yoruba","iso_639_1":"yo","name":"Èdè Yorùbá"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elesin Oba: The King's Horseman","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":17}
