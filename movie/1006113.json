Engineer Colton is killed by henchman Smoky Morgan and Philip Judson hides the body. The engineer, at the request of the widow's niece, Martha, had come to inspect a polluted reservoir. Land Company head Turner and Judson contaminated the water to get the ranchers to vacate so they can grab the land. Judson hires Easy to pose as the engineer, and he reports the reservoir useless but Jimmy's test proves the waters are not deeply polluted. Judson kills Easy to keep him from talking, and casts the blame on Cannonball. But Jimmy has a trick up his sleeve, right after the next song.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vfflVwrzeQXmwIWASnOI58ee5SP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"TWO-GUN RHYTHM WRANGLERS!","title":"Song of the Drifter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
