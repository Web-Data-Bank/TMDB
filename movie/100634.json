For Joe, a small time guy from the small time town of Sandwich, Illinois, his has not even come close - until now. Faced with death and having recently met the girl of his dreams, Claire, Joe has to find a way to live the life of passion he'd always wanted, and he has to do it fast. Journey with Joe towards the great beyond, not half as imaginative as the path he's finally forged here on Earth. Ride with him as he's forced to figure out the meaning of life that he won't have time to live. With the help of his best friend, Frank, and his brilliant, if not terrified mother, Sarah, Joe will finally learn to live, love, and explore beyond his wildest dreams. And we'll get to watch one man's journey unfold, from the first day of the rest of his life on.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/bt7bHkaE658FKU92QpFT5oIt4pf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The things worth fighting for still have to be fought for.","title":"Counting Backwards","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
