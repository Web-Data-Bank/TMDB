The film captures the inevitable and stifling truth for many whose identities lie at the intersections of queer and African. A difficult decision between cultural memory and love, creating a home for themselves or experiencing abandonment, rejection, and harassment. Country Love centers African queer liberation with deliberate and masterful storytelling, weaponizing vulnerability and visibility in refusal of democratized erasure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eJUTsZ3pvKVfpTjSOg9rg6MgOAF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Country Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
