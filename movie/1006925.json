Between the ages of 12 and 16, everyone sees him as a child full of joie de vivre. A characteristic of his native South-West. This joie de vivre is only a smokescreen to protect the balance of his family. Four years that Sébastien is raped. Four years that he suffers and cries out in silence because his predator is none other than one of his parents' relatives, loved by all. Thirty years later, Sébastien has not been able to speak, and his demons are destroying him.","popularity":1.664,"poster_path":"/tM3Z8kPX8jN1kEThvvtPdrvpLN9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179739,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colette Production","origin_country":""},{"id":111406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Make It Happen Studio","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le colosse aux pieds d'argile","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":7}
