The Emperor of China rules over the Forbidden City of Peking. His unmarried daughter, the Princess Turandot, has refused her hand to all her princely suitors by putting them to a test. She sets them three riddles; if they do not answer them correctly, they will lose their heads. As unlucky suitors fail and fall, up steps Calaf, a prince of the Tatar people.  Daniel Kramer’s new staging in Geneva transposes the old fairy tale to a futuristic world where Turandot’s magic holds sway. In a dystopian game show, reminiscent of Hunger Games, the Princess presides over a surveillance state in which men are culled and the reproduction of the human race is conducted in breeding labs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bohrkxcgeBvaO1arUwDrNzjfnTO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turandot - Geneva","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
