Disunity or, conversely, too close contact for a long time, emotional burnout led society to collective trauma. \"New World\" is the story of 12 families from Moscow, Paris, St. Petersburg, New York, Kiev, Simferopol, Herat, Miami and Dublin. The characters of the film are learning to live in new conditions. We follow their transformation with the help of their own video diaries and special shooting, recording the most intimate and important events that they have lived over the past two years. For all of them, the pandemic is becoming a test of strength. Against the background of a new reality and a new world, we remember the pandemic almost with nostalgia, still feeling its consequences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
