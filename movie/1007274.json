To travel in Tassili nâ€™Ajjer is to perform a strict choreography of resource management and walking routes that determine what can be perceived under extreme limitations of climate and physical endurance. These movements are in turn organized by Tuareg guides who rely on protocols of mutual trust and accountability to make safe passage across the plateau, which is sustained by a single source of water. In effect, one can only film where one can walk, with no chance to backtrack or act beyond the present moment and location.  - https://www.sculpture-center.org/","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Ar7UfoW54MIuxkv93BSMlATodIo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tassili","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
