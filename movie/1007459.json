But it is a journey with no clear direction and no fixed paths. A drift through the artificial night of thoughts, into a world of light and dark, doubts and ideas, associations and obviousness.\r The film was created as a theoretical part of the \"And of Life\" cycle, with which Last completed his studies at the University of Fine Arts in Hamburg. Here he processes what he has learned and experienced into a reflection on the documentary and the fictional, the meaning of images and always also the biographical. Quotations from Godard mix with memoirs about the assassination of JFK, pornographic images with private moments - and above all there is the question of filmmaking. Abstract and alienated images tell of a nocturnal journey, a personal story that we witness for a while.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fahrt ans Ende der Nacht","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
