A large-scale media project at the junction of a one-man show, animation and a documentary series. Each episode is an excerpt from a book of memories read by a famous artist. The video sequence was created by leading animation artists, and the music was written by a modern composer. The film is a journey through the pages of Russia's past, which comes to life thanks to sincere and personal testimonies. The heroes of the project are both prominent and not very well–known figures of Russian culture, art and history: writers, composers, artists, public figures and ordinary people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living Memories 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
