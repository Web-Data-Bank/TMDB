Dickinson is successful in this, and we see Jackson in his home just before leaving for the duel, admiring a miniature of his wife, which he afterwards places in his breast pocket. On the way to the dueling ground, Dickinson's skill with a pistol is shown by his breaking a glass, and also shooting a card from an innkeeper's hand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Miniature","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
