Some have called it the countryâ€™s worst massacre of Chinese by whites. Though the killers were known, and at least one confessed, no one was ever convicted.  In 1995, a Wallowa County clerk discovered hidden trial documents, uncovering the nearly forgotten incident.  Why was the story buried? What happened to the killers? Who were the victims?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18075,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oregon Public Broadcasting","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Massacre at Hells Canyon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
