This eight-hour experimental feature is constituted from short film experiments made between 2000 to 2010. These films have already undergone many metamorphoses over the years. They were always restless wandering spirits seeking a permanent place of rest but so far without success. Each section of Homo Sapiens Project (200) was made under the unique condition of living out a form of subtle therapeutic practice. Collectively they reflect major life-changing events, formalistic mutations and thematic shifts within Rouzbeh Rashidi’s filmography. In spite of this, they could not find the peace of a satisfactory final shape. Indeed, they are about peace, something that rarely (if ever) exists within Rashidi’s work. But now, after twenty years of roaming the subconscious, they have come to rest in a permanent retirement in one world, one very personal floating planet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pc1o2nDiqMWv0hhxlXysDJcIMz0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Experimental Film Society","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":490,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homo Sapiens Project (200) (2000-2020)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
