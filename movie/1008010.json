The NGO Proyecto Gran Simio contacts a group of Argentine lawyers to begin a journey to achieve recognition of the three fundamental rights: the right to life, liberty and non-torture. Against them, they will have the zoo managers, related to the animal trafficking mafias, afraid of losing their economic benefits at the expense of the animals.
