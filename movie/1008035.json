They were pioneers of the UN peacekeeping forces, were sent on dangerous missions, but knew little or nothing about what they were sent to. For the first time the veterans talk about their experiences. They tell about dramatic rescue operations and captivity that has never been told before. Then UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld had great ambitions for the UN, and the UN Congo operation was far ahead of its time. At a time when the world is once again characterized by Great Power Politics, the film is a warm defense of international cooperation and present exclusive, never seen archive material from the Congo crisis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ZXrsioOzbf5Ke66GeFuilH4vtT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2022-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"DEDICATED TO THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED DURING THE UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN CONGO (1960-1964)","title":"Congo 1961","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
