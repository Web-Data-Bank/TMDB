Lao Ke, a businessman who failed to do business in Taiwan, put down his body and went to the mainland to serve as a Taiwanese officer, wanting to make a comeback. Lili, a working girl from the Mainland to Shenzhen, met her husband in Taiwan through the Internet and wanted to pursue a better life. They landed on the other side full of hope. Unexpectedly, the treacherous and changeable external situation and internal conflicts that appeared from time to time made the road to dream building extremely difficult.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dlUbDfCylW7THmixUHDS4ZGN5x5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Side","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
