His mood is quiet and pensive as he is surprised and disturbed by a young man (Lee) who walks up next to him and smiles down. They boys greet and walk to a more secluded section of the beach. Lee persuades Mike to remove his clothes and they both stretch out and relax in the sun. Now Lee makes a strange advance as he puts his hand on Mike's bare chest and starts to rub downward. Mike grabs Lee's hand and throws it off – realizing the homosexual advances Lee was about to make – and rises to dress and leave. Lee looks sullen and depressed as he realizes he made the wrong move and he walks behind a rock to watch Mike dress. But Mike sees Lee. He sees the yearning expression on his face. A strange sensation comes over Mike. He walks behind the rock with Lee and looks deep into his eyes. A silent message is conveyed between the two boys. Slowly, Lee kneels in front of Mike, and Mike allows him to perform a sex act on him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4699,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bizarre Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first gay oriented film to be shown in a theater, it was screened at Sahn Sayles' Park Theater in Los Angeles, June 26th, 1968.","title":"Love is Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
