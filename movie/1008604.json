Audrey Napanangka was born at a time when the world was changing for the people in the Central Australian Desert. Settler colonisation was permeating the desert and forced changes and the fusion of two worlds shifted Audrey’s life forever. Today, Audrey raises young people to walk in many worlds, by centering culture, language, and Law in their lives alongside mainstream education. The intimate footage filmed over 10 years in Mparntwe (Alice Springs), Yuendumu and Audrey’s Warlpiri country Mount Theo, showcases a heartwarming story about the power of kinship and family in what is known as Australia.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/ydpCHxAcqHnOHAMQepcBSrYLKtx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Audrey Napanangka","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
