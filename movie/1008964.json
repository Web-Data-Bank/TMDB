Long-time AMV editors ourselves, our goal is to reveal the overwhelming impact of AMVs by taking an intimate, anthropological look into the global AMV community. Audiences get to connect with editors on a personal level as they share their experiences and navigate convention life. Still, our belief is that Synced Together‘s most one-of-a-kind quality is something else entirely, though some things are better seen than told.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gvnWvoeNF6By5znjVFzAmQ5YwwZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Unraveling the world of Anime Music Video (AMV) editing, a multicultural art form that consists of editing anime and music to create fan-made music videos","title":"Synced Together: AMVs & Their Editors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
