The communities of the valley chase the winter away with cowbells and bonfires through the ritual of Scasada dol Zenerù, which is inserted into the story of the shepherd’s life as a dreamlike element that draws on an ancestral memory. Flaminio’s sensitivity, strongly connected to Nature, allows him to perceive when it is time to call the community to act, starting the ritual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zenerù","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
