This meditative practice was gone with the fall of the Soviet Union. It was expected to teach school children to be attentive to human labor and the slightest changes in nature over the annual cycle. This film is a poetic reflection on how the woods of the Pskov region are seen through the eyes of the two former Soviet schoolchildren who grew into hermit foresters measuring trees, sowing new ones, and looking for treasures left in the forest 200 years ago.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Journal of Observations on Nature and Human Labor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
