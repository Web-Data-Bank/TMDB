Without a predetermined script, without ready-made questions, as a simple observer. Through this research, the society of Fourni comes to life before our eyes through its people, through memories, through anxieties, through daily toil. On the island, the men are sailors and the women have taken on all the jobs that one would more conventionally expect men to perform, from construction work to farm work. The camera of Alinda Dimitriou and Nikos Kanakis thus vividly records the relations between the two sexes and how the division of labor is a key cog in the functioning of the social machine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dtTRTmZ6KKR0SjfqLF3Rur3L8oC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1983-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fourni, a women's society","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
