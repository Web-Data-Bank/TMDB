But it wasn't always this way - Three years ago, Miyuki was always uncomfortable around her older brother. The rest of their family treated him no better than a lowly servant, even though he was the perfect Guardian, watching over Miyuki while she lived a normal middle school life. But what really bothered her was that he never showed any emotions or thoughts of his own. However, when danger comes calling during a fateful trip to Okinawa, their relationship as brother and sister will change forever.","popularity":2.674,"poster_path":"/t3begSEWdsyBrxybxr1NZZ5H1lY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2883,"logo_path":"/rDYExnBV61jGQnkhVVrPN4Yl7O1.png","name":"Aniplex","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Irregular at Magic High School: Reminiscence Arc","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3}
