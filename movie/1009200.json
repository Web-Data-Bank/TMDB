About the narratives of each. A woman reads a brief story about an actor's real life marriages; failure and later, wedded bliss. The reading is stiff, awkward and stumbling. The images are of two actors having sex; awkward, stumbling and with an investigatory band ping ponging back and forth, an incessant watching and exposing which ends in song.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pornfilm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
