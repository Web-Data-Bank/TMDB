To create special garments for everyday situations, rather than clothes for special occasions, has consistently been the concept behind the brand's creative activities ever since its establishment. Design is born in the atelier, translated into textiles by craftsmen, before the final products in the form of clothes embark on their journey accompanying people in their everyday life. Portrayed here are four regular minä perhonen customers in five cities- Hiroshima, Yamagata, Okinawa, Tokyo and Paris-who showcase their dailv routine in both work and private life. The video was made by Hikaru Fujii, a contemporary artist who has been working with minä per-honen in the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landscape of Joy to Wear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
