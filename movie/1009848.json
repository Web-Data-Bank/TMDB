The program charts his rise from bar-room crooner to the extraordinary performer, songwriter and vocalist he had become by the early part of the 1980s. Showing also how he developed as a scintillating raconteur, how he was more than willing to draw on a vast range of unorthodox influences, and how his records progressed in sophistication exponentially during the course of a decade, this film is the most detailed, enlightening and downright entertaining film ever to have emerged on this legendary artist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/20j6dpcYJve1iKvXPkje4koGrMv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom Waits Under Review 1971-1982","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
