The installation was inspired by the book entitled “How To Be A Lady,” written by the American writer Candace Simpson-Giles (2001), and stages a Hindu mythological tale  'Draupadi’s Cheer-Haran,' in which her clothing is turned into a never-ending ream of cloth which prevents her from being disrobed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How To Be Your Self (Chapter 02 - You Get Dressed)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
