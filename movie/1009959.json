A stream of abstract, deep and dense images and sounds evolves from a realistic image. The images are transparent, high in resolution and fine in detail. A process of multiple metamorphoses in several parallel spaces and time-layers constantly transforms their consistency, viscosity and transparency. The permeation, stacking and re-visualisation of such layers is almost symphonic, but does not separate areas of certain characteristics into chapters or movements.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DRIFT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
