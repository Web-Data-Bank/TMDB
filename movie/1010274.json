When his friend takes a trip, cinephile Al is left alone for the weekend with three female housemates, a situation that only serves to exacerbate his social awkwardness. One of the most distinctive works to emerge from the ‘Carlton ripple’, David Minter’s 1969 slice-of-life comedy carries echoes of Éric Rohmer’s moral tales.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":180208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Melbourne University Film Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hey Al, Baby","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
