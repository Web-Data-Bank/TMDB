The off-screen reflected in a glass filled with ink is used as a compass and an illusory float with a funambulistic progression. In this very simple optical device, the appearance of city fragments gives directions and stretches the horizon. A walk of short-sightedness and a gathering of images of the overflowing and distraction of senses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ynYPvtF7daMEWUet7rY3xPyAyYg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orientations","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
