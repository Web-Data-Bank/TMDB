It was produced as part of ‘[in]Transition: Journal of Videographic Film and Moving Image Studies 2.2, 2015’, a journal devoted to the form of the video essay, where I’ve also included a substantial Curator’s Note. I was honored to have been invited to create a video response to Remes’ essay, which examines the ontological status of the textual film (and film in general), and to engage so deeply with both his argument and the work of Michael Snow (namely SO IS THIS). In keeping with Snow’s playfulness, and delight in asserting durational control, this piece plays with time, language, and ambiguous authorship.” –Jennifer Proctor","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So's Nephew by Remes (thanx to Michael Snow) by Jorrie Penn Croft","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
