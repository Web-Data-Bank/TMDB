Some Asian American churches silence the issue for fear of division and conflict. Other Asian American church leaders have condemned homosexuality and publicly protested against same-sex marriage. Yet lesbian and gay Asian Americans and their families worship and serve in churches every day. Where are their voices? This honest and thought-provoking film tells a story that the church needs to hear: that of Asian American Christian lesbian and gay people, their pastors, and their parents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/87NsAxw20EOaehhmP1jBpkLQLsI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In God's House: Asian American Lesbian and Gay Families in the Church","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
