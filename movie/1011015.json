He asks his girlfriend Sally, who owns the base caf√©, for help. She goes to the base commander, Col. Baker--who she knows has a crush on her--to help out Herbert. Col. Baker schedules a promotion hearing for Herbert that Friday. He naturally fails it miserably, and then learns that Col. Baker is going out on a date with Sally. Meanwhile, the base military intelligence officer discovers that Herbert is a dead-ringer for the head of a spy ring intending to sabotage a new automated plane, and gets Herbert assigned to infiltrate the gang. Complications ensue.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":"/acmwMpjo0JynWBGYkFKA1BclSJF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sigmund Neufeld Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":142689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spartan Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":180299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tam Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The saddest sack in the sky!","title":"Sky High","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
