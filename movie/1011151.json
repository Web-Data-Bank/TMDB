The video depicts a vertiginous architecture, so devastating that it created new uncontrollable borders and isolated people. Piles of selfies, cats, and meals are scattered everywhere. Text messages evoke a new society living with limitations and suffering from media saturation, sensory overload, and crushing ecological impact.

They become the only reality that is still visible, as the whole world is turning inwards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lhfrRyAK3ildxtNeOCvXtVXzpM2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Shadow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
