If you favour the felines then this animated meditation on cats of all shapes and sizes is for you. The film grew out of industry veteran Vera Linnecar's play with applying mottled coloured paints directly onto animation cels. Paired with the piano music these scenes are a playful experiment, mixing abstraction with careful observation of cat behaviour.  Vera started her animation career at the Halas & Batchelor studio in 1940, as did Elizabeth Horn, who also worked on this film. Moving from tracing, to inbetweening, to animating, Vera became one the company's principle artists. In the late 1940s she moved to the Larkins studio which better suited her experimental spirit. In 1957, along with Nancy Hanna, she joined Bob Godfrey and Keith Learner at Biographic, and continued innovating there until she retired in 1983, after four decades in the business.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bUvrHs5gjcswYofao0iCxQFKNqj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cat Is A Cat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
