This comedy-drama experimental short remixes never-before-seen documentary footage of a failed WeTV pilot featuring the director's mother, a biracial adoptee from a Trumpmaniac family. The director's sisters and nieces humorously flip stereotypes and tragic devices of unscripted TV with surprising dexterity, citing Josephine Baker to Oprah Winfrey. Set to a masterful jazz score by Tomeka Reid, RINGE shows Black women with power behind the camera as much as they are in front of it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lQZVhAK3lzwb54CLkunkIykUtfT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reality is Not Good Enough","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
