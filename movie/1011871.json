In formal terms, The Green Line is a reenactment of an earlier work, The Leak (1996), in which the artist took a can dribbling blue paint for a walk and installed the empty container in the gallery. By recontextualising The Leak in geopolitical terms, Alÿs relocates the tensions in the work from those formal ideas of action and painting to questions of maps and territories and who has the right to live where.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"JO","name":"Jordan"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2004-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Francis Alÿs The Green Line Jerusalem Israel Art","title":"The Green Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
