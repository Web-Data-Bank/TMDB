It focuses on slabs of tactile geletin, which is repeatedly stabbed with a serrated knife. This slow motion violence is arguably a reinterpretation of ideas around the body in sculpture in for example early surrealist works by Giacometti. The fleshy pink tones of the work emphasise the human aspect of the material. Here the inanimate becomes anthropomorphic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cGNVc8kdLwLYdUziUa6Iw8RxvZR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stabbing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
