Through the lens of a mother raising her 8-year-old son in South East London, the film combines a variety of perspectives and stories from people connected to the issue. The documentary engages with the epidemic on a deeper level and endeavours to ignite further conversations that question both the criminal justice system and the current political climate - all of which point to youth knife crime as a symptom of a wider societal problem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/83oeLKvvuM0oKi8tXS1ix4ROKi2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something More","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
