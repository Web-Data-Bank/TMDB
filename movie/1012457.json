A young girl lives together with her friend. Exams are completed, a carefree summer has come: there is time for playing the guitar, reading the poetry of Joseph Brodsky and a cup of coffee on the veranda. An accidental touch of her friend turns the heroine's world upside down. She becomes the object of her sensual desires. Gradually the heroine begins to exist in two worlds: real and transcendental. On one hand, there is a fear of appearing misunderstood, betraying a friend's trust. On the other hand, dreams of touching and intimacy drive her crazy. Sexual fantasies, jealousy, confusion - Attempts to get away from problems with the help of drugs lead to a fatal end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eN2LOVvrgQPOAxn8hf0Fc5zOXbl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She & She","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
