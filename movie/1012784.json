A letter to a sibling, reflecting on our pasts and ourselves, and the parents and grandparents we knew and could never know.  Told in three channels, the voices and the texts overlap and are distant, where a return to the road is a return to solitude as the memories of our grandmothers shape a present loneliness and a gathering of futures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pwxhAEIJHrD9hCXM7ZzSSGkW619.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Dreams and Autumn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
