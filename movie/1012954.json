Neo used musician Lee Wei Song’s original song from his 1987 debut album and also casted Lee in the film. Lee Wei Song is one half of Singapore’s most prolific song writing and music producing twins. Lee won the male category in the singing competition “Talentime 1985/1986” and when offered his first recording contract, he wrote this upbeat title track that describes how a jaded man loses his way in life and conforms to the behaviour of a materialistic and pretentious society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City of Masks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
