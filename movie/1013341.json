A Fakaleiti is born a male child who decides, or is chosen by his family, to dress and behave as a girl. Traditional believe says this occurs when a family may have only male children and deem it necessary to teach one of the boys cooking, cleaning, weaving, sewing – chores associated with a daughter – thus behaving as if a girl. Homosexuality is sometimes the motivation, but not always. Looked on with fascination and disdain, Fakaleitis are a unique, yet vital part of Tongan culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/khZTn51pVrfBGE4s1xf8sao8qQ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like a Lady: The Fakaleitis of Tonga","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
