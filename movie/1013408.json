I am utilizing various conventional and unconventional methods to explore and document these organisms and provide a unique perspective to the glowing life forms. The film begins with a time-lapse of fireflies and various raw film stocks contained in a glass jar. The second portion of the film is the abstract result the bioluminescent insects create with the light sensitive film. The film then focuses on foxfire, the glowing mushrooms. Mushrooms are filmed in their environment using time-exposure cameras and therefore demonstrates the waxing and waning of the fungi's luminescence. The mushrooms are also placed directly onto various raw film stocks generating an animated illustration of foxfire as it burns its image into the film.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lg6eOy6LHFqgmlhNMXnXNfgq28J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matters of Bioluminescence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
