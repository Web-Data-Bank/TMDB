It becomes rare. The wonder is in peril.  The extraordinary atmosphere which it induces and which suspends the stifled daily life, moves away from our impatience.  Snow is a curtain behind which capitalist issues are going on, the consequences of which are universal and global.

Magic operates when the camera catches the flakes in the opposite direction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/evNkIWb6qU8164lmw41oNOx6nZd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nivose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
