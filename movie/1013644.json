At first, not much can be heard apart from the chirping of birds and sounds of the wind. The buzzing of airplane motors then mixes in, and sounds that must come from the man behind the camera. This reference to a human presence in an otherwise seemingly lonely stretch of land is concentrated in instructions that one of the filmmakers calls out to the other from off screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wunderschoen Und Ruhig Gelegen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
