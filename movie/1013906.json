We can guess a personal failure in the past of this solitary Mexican living in Montreal. However, Camilo wants to get back on track and an opportunity to recover his culinary passion finally presents itself. Everything is in place for this new beginning when Camilo receives a visit from his daughter Tania, with whom he had cut ties because of her drug addiction. She tells him that he is a grandfather and asks him to take care of the child while she undergoes her umpteenth rehab. The arrival of this grandson will upset Camilo’s plans. There will be a new beginning for him, certainly, but not as he imagined it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cIMZeKVmd8knLZvRMGoo7csyMxo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7824,"logo_path":"/cZKQQwETnhQQhWRe69CDRceOnAE.png","name":"1976 Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coyote","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
