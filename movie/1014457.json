It is said that every social advance had to be fought for by courageous people - but how did they succeed? Can the enormous global crises of the present be overcome at all? Driven by questions, doubts and visions, the film roams through wild worlds of images, through the promises of happiness in the modern age, frozen in the face of overpowering enemies, experiences resistance, failure and new beginnings. And we're beginning to understand - thanks to the inspiring stories of five people who have been involved in overwhelming social upheaval. Together they wrestle with the authors of the film and the audience for answers. Trace that point where people start fighting. The point at which the decision is made to leave normality and safety behind in order to dare something completely new.","popularity":0.962,"poster_path":"/96Ro8hGfKzzqVrkF6AS9CiTZLeP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185112,"logo_path":"/7p4Wn4Hl4uRHtjXbmyF4ylo8q4D.png","name":"Freischwimmer Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":185113,"logo_path":"/qMEQIehg9TaogsVA8T6QLH8WC39.png","name":"leftvision","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rise Up","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
