In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has declared QAnon a potential domestic terrorism threat. For one family, QAnon has caused division so severe that they had to report their relative - Tim Stewart, a QAnon conspiracy theorist - to Australia's national security hotline. In a concerning twist, it emerged that Stewart has had a longstanding friendship with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison - leading to speculation about QAnon and Australia's highest ranks of political power. A look at the alarming movement which has caused ripples through the world, through the eyes of one family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gVgeCzSpGKVCqUQLgBCVS7yB6u3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1253,"logo_path":"/6f0A0AqIPHYheRb90tVMutuzSnP.png","name":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Awakening: QAnon","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
