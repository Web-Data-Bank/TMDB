All 176 people on board were killed, many of them Iranian Canadians. For weeks Iranian authorities vociferously denied responsibility, but foreign governments and agencies were certain the plane was shot down by Iranian military, a fact Iran’s government eventually admitted. There were no answers as to why the plane was fired on or even why it was allowed to take off, since hostilities had broken out in the region in preceding days.","popularity":2.88,"poster_path":"/hEvyQcNVIwRHD332ZIW4ybxR4kS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Payam Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"752 Is Not a Number","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
