How far away are they from us? Could life exist without them? All these questions have fascinated humanity since the dawn of time. So over the centuries, generations of astronomers, physicists and dreamers have tried to answer them. Among them, four little-known women have played a decisive role thanks to work that has changed our vision of the cosmos.  Our documentary series \"Chercheuses d'étoiles\" (here proposed in full version) tells you about these great astronomical discoveries made by women forgotten by history. The video explores the immensity of infinite space, the origins of the world around us and the secrets of dark matter.","popularity":0.608,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":136062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Monde","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women star seekers: they changed our vision of the Universe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
