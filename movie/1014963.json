The film explores how this deceptive ideology has torn apart the fabric of society while using black America as its number one tool for its destruction.  From Executive Producer Larry Elder and Director Justin Malone, comes the continuation of their highly acclaimed film, Uncle Tom (2020). Uncle Tom II will take the audience deeper into black Americaâ€™s often eradicated history of honorable men, entrepreneurship, prosperity, faith, and patriotism, to its current perceived state of anger, discontent and victimhood.","popularity":2.996,"poster_path":"/2kYdag5o8zhyFmnc68TNSEZv5Yf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malone Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncle Tom II: An American Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":9.7,"vote_count":3}
