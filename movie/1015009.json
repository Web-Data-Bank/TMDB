Emphasis is given to the ways in which these developments have kept pace with the ever-growing demands of a nation that today virtually \"lives out of box cars.\" The picture also offers a glimpse of the operational mechanics of the country's complex railway net¬works—accenting the many applications of electricity. The striking color and the non-technical, human-interest approach combine to give this picture high general-audience appeal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20905,"logo_path":null,"name":"General Electric","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shining Rails","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
