At the end of the century, in the 1990s drama 'M', the green-eyed protagonist warned of the end of mankind due to the virus. On October 28, 1992, many people gathered together in the belief that their bodies would be lifted up into heaven, but only one moth was able to ascend to heaven. On December 31, 1999, people gathered at Jonggak and listened to the sound of the bells, and waited for the end of the day. On December 31, 2020, those who could no longer gather together greeted the end by listening to a virtual bell in a virtual space and began to wait again. The video consists of images, sounds, and stories exchanged with people on the web to avoid boredom waiting for the world’s doomsday.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uyOrMr9WmDjGdQKRXswFT54G1PP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waiting M","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
