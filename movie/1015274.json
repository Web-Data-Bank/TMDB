Jeff has one of the most prolific careers in hard rock music, having been involved with numerous artists such as Yngwie Malmsteen, Talisman, Axel Rudi Pell, Eyes, Takara and countless others.  Jeff's set was hailed the highlight of the festival and when reflecting on the very day such giants in the melodic rock world such as Eric Martin (Mr. Big) Harem Scarem, Hardline and Honeymoon Suite also graced the stage then this was no small achievement.  The set takes us on a nostalgic trip through Jeff's musical journey, including favourites from his past and present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/baa27hzaHz8JEEAY6tvgEWCkpDQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeff Scott Soto: JSS Live At The Gods 2002","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
