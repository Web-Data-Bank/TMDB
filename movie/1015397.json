Precious objects - votive offerings from the National Etruscan Museum in Villa Giulia - ornaments from churches or Roman sculptures, as well as contemporary detritus come together and evolve together in a kind of amniotic fluid. Usually inert forms have evolved into autonomous creatures: these composite beings interact, gesticulate, attract each other, react. By adopting the point of view of objects, by infusing them with a dose of desire, by giving them a semblance of soul, the artist reconsiders the border between the living and the non-living.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x33MTbdAP1y5ZJM4DpPPzYcyPzB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bassin d'attraction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
