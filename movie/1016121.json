He spends his nights fighting in underground boxing matches, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. But Abby wants nothing to do with Travis. Intrigued by Abby’s resistance, Travis offers her a simple bet: if he loses his next fight, he must remain sex-free for a month. If he wins, Abby must live in his apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that Abby’s dark past is about to emerge, and he may have finally met his match.","popularity":108.876,"poster_path":"/bwdLflvCcOCRPqb1x13KPuYIzVx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6626,"logo_path":"/A1BnMoWjzjOrjzpWimyBQkf84mS.png","name":"Voltage Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beautiful Disaster","video":false,"vote_average":5.546,"vote_count":142}
