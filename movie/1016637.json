He hasn't returned home for a few years while studying in a big city. The estrangement between him and his mother (Lin Jiehua) is somehow getting bigger and bigger. He is immersed in his artistic dreams and is not practical, but his mother, who has always been conservative, does not understand. His friends remained the same, still the same young people in the small town. Friends booed that he would be the most promising one among them, but he himself was convinced. He told his sister (played by Sun Nan) that he would go to the big city to make a fortune.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t3kfWgRy0CEaaAvUOirXvUKN0bF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Disparition","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
