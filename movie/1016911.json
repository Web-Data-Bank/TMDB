The plot is based on a true story: the “sophisticated” way of exterminating prisoners in the Mauthausen concentration camp. They were thrown from the so-called “rock of paratroopers” in the quarry. The first to die there in 1940 were British paratroopers and the Dutch volunteers who helped them. They were captured in Nazi-occupied Holland and became the first victims of this bloody “attraction”. The guards and the administration of the camp enjoyed this “attraction” until the liberation of the camp in 1945.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Attraction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
