A teacher of \"emotionally disturbed\" children takes on a new student who is considered to be \"untrainable\" by public school authorities, psychiatrists, and medical doctors. Even the child's own mother, who is very loving, does not have the tools to reach her \"hopeless\" child. This is the further story of a teacher who understood what it was like to be eight years old and hurt and angry and confused; a teacher who saw these children for who they were, rather than who they seemed to be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vUjor2YxZ3S7mHuKm6lfUlYxunx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Time-Life Television Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lovey: A Circle of Children, Part II","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
