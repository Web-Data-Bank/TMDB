The horizon in the middle divides the image into two equal fields, the sea and the sky. The quietly rolling waves create an almost meditative atmosphere, until the horizon suddenly takes on a life of its own. The camera shakes on its tripod, as though affected by an earthquake, so that the dividing line between the sea and sky is constantly moving. This camera movement causes the sea and waves to lose their spatiality. The two fields become increasingly abstract, and as a result of the pulsing horizon it seems as if they are attempting to push each other out of the frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/85d5laCfjATnfz6KtlP3Df2GXWo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vibrating Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
