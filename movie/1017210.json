To avoid arrest, he boards a train and travels home. The house now seems somehow haunted, as doors slam shut and shadows are seen running throughout the corridors. But Gilberto soon discovers that it's his own troubled conscience that is torn in two. He hesitates as one part tells him to accept the attraction that his father's 'world' exerts on him whilst the other orders him to destroy everything to pursue his own ideals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stress","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
