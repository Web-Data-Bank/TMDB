Far from feeling safer, he soon becomes obsessed with the idea that someone is stalking him, and he connects the signal from the surveillance cameras to the TV in the living room. Progressively, the images of the closed circuit supplant the programs and the movies, until becoming the only thing that is reproduced on the screen. His wife and his children helplessly witness the man's madness... but maybe \"something\" out there is really threatening the family. Something visible only between the pixels of the TV.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7EUjsgX8TLo9YCN2Xj9t2pNPRAN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133785,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prointel","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":114310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isla Audiovisual","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El televisor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
