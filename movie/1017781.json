Very special, since the wolf disappeared from The Netherlands 150 years ago. The importance of this for our nature is great. It is therefore understandable that conservationists are very happy with this development. On the other hand, after a century and a half, society is no longer equipped to live with such an impressive animal. How can people and wolves in The Netherlands live together in the most conflict-free way possible? Filmmaker Cees van Kempen started filming before a pair of wolves had settled permanently in The Netherlands. Over the past four years, van Kempen and his team have spent more than a thousand days in the forests of Poland, Germany and The Netherlands for this film.","popularity":0.721,"poster_path":"/4R9kYt5LCBus2BNBwwP4KNdF7PV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
