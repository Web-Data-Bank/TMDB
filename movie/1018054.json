The video is coupled with text-to-speech machine poetry about the end of the world generated from a prompt by Tonya Foster in my class at Ithaca College's Image Text Ithaca MFA Program. The title of this course was Writing for the End of Worlds. Our final assignment was to create a video poem. Omnipotent Glow is a result of that class as well as a result of the state of the world in 2020 at the height of COVID-19, wildfires, bombings, and other atrocities.  In many ways, this video is almost a letter from the future and from the perspective of maybe an artificial intelligence helping humans remember what has happened to their world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y3hExizvdsYCcHKkPqV6Oq0Vptl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short experimental film compiling natural, human-made disasters, found footage of bombings, and self-made video of everyday life.","title":"Omnipotent Glow","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
