Only one of the boys involved tries to help her. But his attempt to take responsibility for his actions gets lost in the self-centred hubbub generated by the mothers and teachers. Shot in one continuous take, the film explores the meaning of truth and reality – not just in terms of content but also on a formal level.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"操场","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
