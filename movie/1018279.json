Both youth saw their homes burned down during communal violence in 2012. Phyu Phyu Than is confined in an apartheid-style camp and has no chance to go to school or travel to her home just a few miles away. Aung San Myint's family struggles to survive and support his high school studies to fulfill his dream to go to medical school. Interviews filmed over two years with the teenagers reveal their ideas about each other's communities and the hope of reconciliation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l8JgixFvSrorWF3TdammECj1jQX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sittwe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
