She suffocates in her daily life as she tries to pick up the pieces of her life, but can no longer. Everything is out of place and Barbara no longer has control over anything. Her work, her home and her life as a whole become a labyrinth, where nothing else can serve to guide her.

While struggling outside her aquarium, Barbara will have to look for the ocean so she doesn't suffocate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nwiJqawYguLTVMlZ6aZHO7eVBGE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2022-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Barbara finds herself trapped in the labyrinth of her everyday life.","title":"Out of Water","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
