Erskine Loch---and a woman from a cultish native tribe. Andre and Captain Benson (Erskine Loch) go into a Caribbean jungle with Rita de le Vega, whose dad was an explorer who lost his life among the savage Penitentes tribe, but left behind information concerning a treasure. They encounter the tribe who put on a voodoo ceremony by hanging a tribesman on a cross as a sacrifice under the supervision of the voodoo witch doctor. Using underwater diving equipment, Andre & Company find the lost pirate treasure in a stone idol, and head for their yacht with the savages in hot pursuit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tmj80NT4GF4rCOoVmkpBslcW342.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190077,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andre Roosevelt Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Caribbean","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
