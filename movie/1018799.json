They get caught trying to short-count him, and he threatens to have them arrested. After a series of disasters--they ruin a customer's suit, their store blows up--they get a telegram notifying them that a man they once did a kindness for has left them quite a bit of money and a house, but in order to get the inheritance, they have to spend a night in the bedroom of the man's house. When they arrive there, they notice two things--the place is kind of creepy and a series of spooky incidents leaves them to believe the house is haunted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sGSrKBCHI3SAMFly9c6WbDN8Bza.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toddy Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A thriller-diller of laffs... chills and thrills","title":"Fight That Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
