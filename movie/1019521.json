He can be considered as Latvian Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or Václav Havel. Twenty years he spent in Soviet prisons because of anti-government thinking. In a 1983 trial by the Latvian SSR, Astra said, “I believe this time will fade like an evil nightmare.”  The fate of Gunārs Astra himself was tragic. Like Alexei Navalny in Russia, Astra was poisoned with tea on a train to Saint Petersburg. A week later, Gunārs Astra died. Astra’s death became a symbol of light on the long road to the restoration of Latvia’s independence.","popularity":1.192,"poster_path":"/xmwh1aFEeu3f5VSMD40sp6oZfBy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90476,"logo_path":null,"name":"SKUBA films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Astra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
