They talk about good and evil, religion and school results. They are in fifth grade and live the age when one is born into the world. Denis Gheerbrant was able to capture, to arouse the word, between childhood and adolescence, between life in the neighborhood, at home and at school. Filmed in Gennevilliers, in an environment known to be difficult, the film holds up a mirror to us through singular conversations that reveal a surprising maturity in the face of the challenge represented by the entry into adolescence, and further into society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oDJW9AwjULxcmm9kb5Elyv4EvX1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grands comme le monde","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
