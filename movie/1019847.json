Con bravura is about conspiracy conflating the paths of a rather unconventional nun and an intrigued young man â€“ each of them bears secrets and the encounter could incite a flaming romance, though one suffocated by war.Munk set the film in the mountain capital of Zakopane and its vicinity, allowing breathtaking views from a cable car and using his experiences of the Nazi occupation in the area to add gritty reality. The director plays a cameo as a priest with several of his industry friends also making appearances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1958-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Con bravura","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
