There is no room for fantasies, and this task is difficult to solve. The world of sensations requires transcription and translation. Sometimes you feel one thing, but describe another. Frankness is ruthless, and truthfulness is often ugly. You have to model from fragments of reality and dreams. A world of words, a world where the main thing is not to explain and justify, is the main thing to create\" (Dmitry Trofimov).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4tUFdlGh2ySbQtB90Urc1cWAv6k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
