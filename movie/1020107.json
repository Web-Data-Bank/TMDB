This short spies on the audition process and opens our eyes to what it's like for mixed race actors in the industry today. These rooms see some of the most cringe-worthy moments for actors who are desperately trying to showcase their skill and exposes the pressure that is put on them to tick all of the right boxes. An awkward, vulnerable and funny look into the cost of putting yourself out there and just how far we still have to go with working out our preconceptions. A call to action to dismantle prejudices and lead with respect and kindness within this industry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mahUCbFD2qDThI2T8IMJ8y4WVIh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beige","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
