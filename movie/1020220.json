Not realizing that even though it may seem unique, everyone has a story worth telling. People who live the moment that will change them forever, that will define and vindicate them. Moments in our lives where we have been, or will be, aware of a change of stage; of a before and an after. Moments when we feel like we’re dragging our backs every minute we’ve lived. Because we are all inside our chrysalis until someone breaks them and forces us to face the real world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y3K07XI6Z9ogmP6tuf1aESAUVqA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48089,"logo_path":"/vJjQD0IIdGukQft4uK73wlJLby.png","name":"Escac Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":181638,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esquitx","origin_country":""},{"id":181639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Verkami","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chrysalises","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
