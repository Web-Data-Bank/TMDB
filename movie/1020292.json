She shone a few years later alongside Jean-Paul Belmondo in \"L'Homme de Rio\". From there, a great international career is announced to the young actress. But in 1967, a few months after filming the \"Demoiselles de Rochefort\" with her sister, she died tragically in a road accident, at the age of 25. Nevertheless, she leaves behind an abundant career and thus continues to be present in the minds of cinephiles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7scfIixcYpxeXRl2WAqDWVOHjmb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Françoise Dorléac, de L'Homme de Rio aux Demoiselles de Rochefort","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
