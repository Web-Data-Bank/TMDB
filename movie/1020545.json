This is the first year since Mama passed away and the children are working together to fill the void and put together a Christmas play at their church. There are challenges along the way, from a runaway lamb to the stern lady who plays the church organ, but with the help of Uncle Henry's new song, 'We Three Kings,' not only is the Christmas pageant a success, but the children learn truths about Jesus and the gifts that were given to Him by the Magi.","popularity":0.609,"poster_path":"/k9nCxAd0EEAwTcBhG3QcVOCVRyb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181671,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thorn Crown Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Three Kings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
