His dream to fly has impelled him to construct his own helicopter. Its a ramshackle assembly of scrap and found objects. The machine has no real practical capability aside from standing as a monument to his individuality. It becomes evident that an art buyer has offered money for the flamboyant creation, a mixed blessing that has caused a fracas. The community are unjustifiably demanding a stake in the potential spoils. Joe must fight them off, or lose all he has worked for.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7J6aLu5pW1OvjuxHBQpz0CFysXT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":171,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One mans battle with the dark side of human nature.","title":"Time spent with cats is never wasted","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
