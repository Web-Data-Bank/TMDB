Spike's TV output was to lose none of that shows anarchic, surreal and devastatingly funny humour, as his series \"Q\" (1968-1980) and \"There's A Lot Of It About\" (1982) broke every known television and comedy rule in sketch after sketch of nonsensical brilliance.  This compilation captures the highlights of those series, including such classic sketches as The Eurovision Joke Contest, Spike as the singing Viking Maiden, insects auditioning for a David Attenborough series and much more assorted lunacy from the world of an indisputable comic genius.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oxUxT9Zocdoh2cXwnQKkrXwGfkz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best Of Spike Milligan","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
