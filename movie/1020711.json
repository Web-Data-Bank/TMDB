James Island, which was a holding cell for slaves during the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade, to Kunta Kinteh Island- after one of The Gambia's most well-renowned sons. It shares the points of view of both the government and the Kinteh family, who still preserve their history as residents of neighboring Juffureh Island. This film embodies the rich spirit of a people that can be passed on throughout the diaspora for decades to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dTgUTEhOTXAmTTaRTIDYEMFYaa9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kunta Kinteh Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
