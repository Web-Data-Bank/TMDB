Since the end of 2009 when the government began soliciting expert opinion for the Animal Protection Act, the focus of public debate has always been on whether one should be eating cats or not, or whether cat-eating is a Chinese tradition or not, there are even people who would go as far as to say that the call to stop eating cat meat is \"imposing the will of the minority on the majority\". Yet the \"majority\" does not understand the complete truth of cat-meat trading chains: cat theft, cat trafficking, killing cats, selling cats, and eating cats.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eiG83a2HGLgySP0SDZEk4PpGgwc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ai Weiwei Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2010-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanhua","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
