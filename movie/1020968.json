Sadness for humans not knowing how to be human. It is 1922. What was he thinking? What are they thinking now? He comes home to ask for water and his mother doesn’t recognise him anymore. What difference does it make? A century has passed, and nothing has changed”.  A dadaistic cinematic essay like a river of time, that shows respect to Buñuel. Filmed in analogue and dispersed through images of body parts, a couple close together, leisurely observations, animal skulls, and changing nature – a nova terra, or new world, seems to be thus revealed. The director’s voice sounds out from behind the camera, capturing us, making us want to join in and ask questions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonds of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
