The paintings of the ex-commander in chief and first lady, by artists Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald, were revealed to much fanfare at the National Portrait Gallery in 2018. The portraits — which drew record attendance to the Washington art museum — have since traveled the country as part of a nationwide exhibition.","popularity":1.785,"poster_path":"/yM9qPuoeCVokKGoQ8iXakAgb0uG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picturing the Obamas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
