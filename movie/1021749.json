But in the face of despair, people put aside reasons and stop worrying. For these couples from Malaysia, Indonesia, and Korea, even love blossoms. They embrace each other and cling to one another desperately and fearlessly. Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and Seoul. Three couples in three cities in three countries: The paths of a telemarketer for a loan company and a cart rink owner are destined to cross. A pub owner and a woman with their own background stories. A virgin forklift operator who has never kissed before and a kiss-for-sale manager.","popularity":1.919,"poster_path":"/j1GSIWzf8zrTiVCWomOIPipvT4T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Line","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":72766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vera Lasut Production","origin_country":""},{"id":191745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Happy Together Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":143899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paperheart","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"LOVE BLOSSOMS IN THREE CITIES","title":"Look At Me Touch Me Kiss Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
