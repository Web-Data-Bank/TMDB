The artist performs during the opening hours of the Biennale – a total of 200 days. Fusinato is performing live in the pavilion using an electric guitar as a signal generator into mass amplification to improvise slabs of noise, saturated feedback and discordant intensities that trigger a deluge of images onto a freestanding floor-to-ceiling LED wall. The images are sourced via a stream of words that have been put into an open search across multiple online platforms. The mass indexing is a mess – a morass of disparate and disconnected randomly generated images. There is no theme as such; rather the immersive encounter with sound and image is open for the audience to interpret and make sense of. The intent is to create some kind of hallucination, elation in disorientation and exhaustion from confusion","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8NvOowGCxPjSzZhGTbPgJDWZJ8b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DESASTRES","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
