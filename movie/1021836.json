Streets become the dull, slow backdrop to her vividness. Oblivious to storefronts and curious stares, seeing only the yellow lines and the cracks in the pavement, she snakes and two-steps around seams and lines without loss of élan, chanting spells that shade into vague sounds. “Step on a line, break the devil’s spine, Step on a crack, break the devil’s back, Step in a ditch, your mother’s nose will itch, But if you step in between, everything will be keen!” By igniting her route with meaning, she briefly wrests public space from the commercial values this city lives by.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/59fWB32B7mXcnrC3m8Guh3qnwWR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2020-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children's Game #23: Step On A Crack","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
