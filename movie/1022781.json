Prior to his coming, T.J. researches and studies the Muslim faith as he wants to convert Mohammed to Christianity. One night, the conversation turns to the subject, and T.J. is shocked when he finds out why few Muslims ever come to Christ. This is a very, very powerful film and truly one that every professing Christian, especially in America, should see.
