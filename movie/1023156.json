Miguel, a young teacher, is destined for a small mountain town on the border between Spain and Portugal: Lobosandaus, an inhospitable place, inhabited by distant people with remote traditions. It doesn't seem like the ideal place for someone like Miguel, who is determined to spread light and knowledge among his students. But reason cannot overpower desire, and as winter progresses, Miguel feels the darkness take over everything around him while his fascination with the enigmatic Dorinda grows. The unexpected death of an inhabitant will have a big impact on the city and will open the doors to a strange and ghostly presence.","popularity":35.462,"poster_path":"/safBynAB9Z5mjzyfgVpj2vCZrgE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119362,"logo_path":"/3VMbHWa9xwWBaIN311GmXXxtJI9.png","name":"AGADIC","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":146052,"logo_path":"/eWrxy5R2izv2WV0zA5cvGq7e2fz.png","name":"Fasten Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":9974,"logo_path":"/jd5x1rD18FAswqv1tRwPJCSbRGz.png","name":"ICAA","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":130917,"logo_path":"/gXA2RLIgZOVQvRpEfwTflajewfs.png","name":"OlloVivo Producións","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":58958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xunta de Galicia","origin_country":""},{"id":197150,"logo_path":"/wT94M0GOt8e7m3DoseBdTqkGznO.png","name":"RTVE","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":8683,"logo_path":"/tLgfcgUC96znl4rzt8gaUCRruY1.png","name":"Cinemate","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Have you ever tried to kill a spirit?","title":"The Open Body","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
