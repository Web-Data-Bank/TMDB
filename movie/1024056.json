The two men take it in turns to face themselves with the bullet loaded and damaged, and present the consciousness of a young man who is not alive until he fires a shot into the magazine of his revolver.  The young man's consciousness is presented to him. A friend comes along or pulls the trigger. The film is a drama, as are 『裏窓』 and『冬の光』. The woman is found. The film is quite interesting, but you have to pull the trigger to find out if you will die from a gunshot. But that is not to say that the film is not interesting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"裏窓","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
