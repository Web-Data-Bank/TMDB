Hunger drives Leon (Albert Lichtenstern) onto the street. His mother has once again not taken care of him and is somewhere. To get money and food, the 15-year-old steals everything that is not nailed down. He finds small odd jobs in the run-down \"Palaise Cherie\" brothel, which has become a place to go for him. His fatherly friend Klaus (Detlev Dorendorf), the \"Koberer\", sits on his stool day and night and tries to guide passers-by into the shop. And then there is a prostitute to whom Leon feels attracted. As always, the boy somehow gets through the day - but this time he has to realise that his mother is not coming back to him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiezjargon – Leonidas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
