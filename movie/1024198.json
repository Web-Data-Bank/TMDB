We tagged along on their recent tour to document midnight desert peyote sessions and foreign language festival love. Here's a statement from director Andy Capper:  \"When Sean Yeaton (bassist) quit his job to leave behind the safety of his desk for the wild life of a performing minstrel I decided to get a camera and follow him on the first three weeks of his new life.  We went from Mexico to Texas and London in a very short period of time. I love Sean and his band — Austin, Andrew and Max — and I hope that this is reflected in this short film that we made together.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light Up Gold Road Trip","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
