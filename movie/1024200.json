Hamburg in a state of emergency. A hurricane with wind force 12 is racing towards the city. A prisoner's van collides with an animal transporter. The murderer Axel Krakoff escapes, but so do two monkeys. Before curfew takes effect, insurance scammer Bonnie tries to make a few quick bucks and two rappers start a drug delivery service by drone. In order to have enough dope, they rob ex-boxer Mickey Mommsen. Too bad Mickey is a neighbourhood big shot who you don't mess with. A lot to do for Erichsen and his colleagues from the Criminal Investigation Service and actually nothing special – were it not for the threat of a storm of the century. The best crime fiction entertainment with wry humour, bizarre characters and an outstanding Erichsen.","popularity":0.702,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightshift – The Calm Before the Storm","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
