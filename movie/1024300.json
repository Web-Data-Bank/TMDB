Although his Central restaurant in Lima, Peru, is considered to be the best of the decade in Latin America and number 2 in the world, and his wife Pía León is considered to be the world's best female chef, his inspiration, research and creative work goes much further than these recognitions. Virgilio is an explorer of Peru's different regions, giving its origin to the revolutionary concept of the \"World in Altitudes\", based on the elevations of the earth that forever changed the way local gastronomy is seen in today's world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8yPShEJnq6JqXvO0UTcSqLWWCZk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virgilio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
