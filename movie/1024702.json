Decades after his career as a tobacco advertising icon, Bryan Burns’ (Tommy Darwin) life is in ruins. After his mother dies of lung cancer, he is tormented by a talking cigarette on an anti-smoking billboard. He snaps and transforms into the Ribspreader, a killer stalking the city, extinguishing smokers and cutting out their lungs to make his macabre smoking jacket. Littered with excessive set pieces and moments of genuine hilarity, the precious gold is the brilliant cast of faces from Adelaide’s underground.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bhtgQ7NEaBhWqb0yFUSAS47AHPQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trasharama","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"'Smokin, it'll kill you in the end.
