During the mission, Four-faced Buddha`s son Shawn was killed by an identified person, and a kidney that was intended to be illegally sold was stolen as well. Four-faced Buddha is a notorious human trafficker. STAR member Vincent hates Four-faced Buddha`s dehumanisation, and he joins the Singapore Special Investigation Division to destroy Four-faced Buddha. In the meantime, Four-faced Buddha has found Yusoff, who was once a STAR instructor, hiding in Malaysia. Yusoff was the one who killed Shawn and stole the kidney. He was willing to take the risk because his daughter was born with a kidney disease. Vincent and his team join forces to annihilate Four-faced Buddha`s organisation.","popularity":2.911,"poster_path":"/vPi3p9OoAzxjhOTgz3HLgODDRb0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185895,"logo_path":null,"name":"8028 Holdings","origin_country":""},{"id":185896,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artistes Marketing Asia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2022-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deleted","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
