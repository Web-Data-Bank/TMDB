In this black comedy, the main character's fundamental resolve to do the right thing collides with the tragicomic absurdity of corrupt or incompetent attorneys, damaged, unbalanced clients, and a catastrophically broken family-law system. Pilot Synopsis: Tommy Laudadio, an altruistic law-school grad paying a steep price for a big mistake, is beyond desperate for a job. At an interview with a divorce firm he observes the owner and his henchman bullying and cheating clients; while trying to help the clients Tommy comes face to face with tragicomic absurdity of the entire family-law system. This might be Tommy's last chance to save his future-but it's clear he will have to sacrifice every principle he lives by if he wants to grab it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gEF08QP2eb77ya0FIM7SqJsFRDm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inferno","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
