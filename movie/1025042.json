Try to recreate the third space with the characteristic of \"halo\" through images. The halo points to ambiguity and a sense of distance, while the third space is the difference space constructed by reality and consciousness. The work uses fragments of daily life and poetic non-linear narrative as two narrative means, interspersing and advancing the narrative, which corresponds to the two viewing states of the audience, namely reverie and trance, and hopes to connect the audience with the image in the form of flowing water.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2fQVS93oAE8oTC2cxufhh96tnuk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"#Religion, # Southern Fujian, # I Ching","title":"THE FOG HAS COVERED THE MOMENT AGAIN","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
