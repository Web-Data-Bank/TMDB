The latter feels that if she will die anyway, she prefers to do so with love and fun. And with booze, cigarettes and some action between the sheets. The men who are attracted by her personal ads, like flies by honey, are thrown out by the annoyed daughter. And talking of flies... they are a persistent pest as well. She fails to kill them, as they turn out to be motherâ€™s friends, who in this imaginative animation bring about a climax.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cq22eFveikR6JUlNS8TuUPKeQ8x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spotted Bird","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
