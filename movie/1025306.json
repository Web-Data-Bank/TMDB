This is Longwang Village, an empty old farming society, the most essential reality of an ordinary western village. The film does not have a perpetual plot. The images are presented with the changing of the four seasons. There is no great joy or great sadness. Everything is recorded, and no results are produced. Strictly speaking, this is actually just a rural video file, a running account of ordinary western villages without all rhetoric.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9WoJTbRqfpUCQ8rYifkUPMojiF6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE LONGWANG CHRONICLES: A YEAR OF LIFES IN A CHINESE VILLAGE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
