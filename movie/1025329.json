The bank's collection and the finance company used threats and intimidation to collect debts. Sanhe has since fallen into the hell of \"using cards to raise cards\". Taiwan’s first \"card god\" Yang Huiru, who successfully profited from banks with bonus points, used the loopholes in bank bonuses to successfully connect relatives and friends to purchase tickets or shopping station goods by swiping cards, and then use online auctions to earn the difference. Earning millions in the bank, the bank stopped using credit cards. Yang Huiru, who has also experienced personal pain, persuaded the card slaves to face reality: \"Hurry up and cut off the card! Because the interest is too heavy, don’t think about borrowing another cash card to pay off the card debt. It’s getting deeper and deeper.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lJstsH8sLN7rVOF3NsJOVCir3gp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CARD BOOM","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
