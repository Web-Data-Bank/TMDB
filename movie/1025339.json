Without any commentary, the film records, in the switches and transitions of the faces, the gamut and track of emotions and vision of the author in enjoying the photographs by Koudelka—from the scenes of life in “Gypsies”, to the conflicts in “Invasion”, further to the still images in “Exiles”, and finally focused on desolately dignified “Chaos”. The four chapters of the film echo the four photo albums of Koudelka. With the indoor CD player playing the music by Shostakovich, the invasion of the landscape without the windows, intermingled with the background noise, complicates the ambient circumstances of the film and renders an immediate sense of urgency and relevance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4AmtFtUv5SmViil2rQV1zwVKYQc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KOUDELKA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
