One after another adapts to the random events that come to shape their lives, to the four seasons of life and nature.  The years they were about experience coincided with the reforms and opening up of China. Floating in the changes of the new era, some experience compromises and the loss of ideals, whilst some keep struggling ahead with great determination. Thirty years later, Lin Xin encounters his old classmates, and records their individual lives and history; the ease of monotony, the loneliness of success, the weariness of a life of plentiful, the helplessness of poverty... all come forth in the lives of these group of people, becoming an epitome of the lives of ordinary people in small to middle-sized cities in this era, and at the same time reflecting on a generation that advances forward undefeated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7KSYWih1OzVorJaIDkv8qszWlV4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":203,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CLASSMATES","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
