You can only take one of them, and wonder about the other for the rest of your life. Longwu is a temple of no more than 20 monks. When 17-year-old Jime became a junior monk there, he had no idea whether it's better to renounce or to join the secular world. The temple quietly sits in the depths of a mountain.This year, with only 11 monks left, there are not enough junior monks to officially receive the precepts during summer recluse. The temple seniors decide to have three young monks to do this. Jime is fully aware what this means to him. He patiently waits for an answer to dawn on him. On a dark night, Jime takes out the long roll of sutra that he reads every day, and cleans it carefully by a lamp. This summer, someone has come to the crossroad of life. Of the two roads out there, he can only choose one.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iwK19wDX8kYm1gzsbIOKCkVeX5B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"YOUNG JIGME","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
