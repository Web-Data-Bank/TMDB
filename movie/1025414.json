And misfortunes came one after another. The 60-year-old demented son was deliberately abandoned by his brother-in-law, and the young tenant went astray for so-called love. Life was getting tougher. In the constant struggles, the 90-year-old father felt hard to bear the burden of life, and wanted to end his life with pesticides with his son. The film ends here and leaves the suspense, in which the cold-bloodedness and fetters of kinship are vividly displayed. The feeling of powerlessness goes straight to the hearts through screen. Two people’s lifetime adding up to 150 years come to an abrupt end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4hWushe7iJsE1Rtbn0rxhPGLfNI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"#Beijing #Family #Kinship","title":"ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OF LIFE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
