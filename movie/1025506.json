It is a significant precursor to the immersive video\r installations that gained prominence as a medium for avant-garde art during the 1970s. This\r project constitutes a continuation of Morris’s earlier interest in installations that produce a total\r environment, as in his 1961 work, Untitled (Passageway). In 2001, the Whitney Museum of\r American Art included Finch College Project in the exhibition Into the Light: The Projected\r Image in American Art 1964–1977, placing this piece in conversation with similar moving-image\r installations created by artists such as Vito Acconci, Simone Forti, Dan Graham, and Joan\r Jonas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cSOGgyBGdVZbZdcaLSWpQ2OjTMA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finch Project","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
