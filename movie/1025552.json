The amputated leg, a phantom limb that he can still move in his mind, is the pivotal point of this story. At the same time a trace of the war that made him lose most of his family members and forced him to flee his country, at the same time a brake on his exodus that made walking painful and more laborious than any of his fellow travelers, it is also the fulcrum for his integration into a new territory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/59gefZBmXQ11ZaLyicYORQafozm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zou","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
