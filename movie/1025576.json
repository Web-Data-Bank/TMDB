He took his daughter Sonya and moved to the picturesque countryside in the south. A cottage in the mountains, steep winding tracks, and a new eco-hotel as a family business - that's what his life is about now. But before the hotel's grand opening everything goes awry. The place gets smashed, then Sokolovsky meets another silver-spooner and steps on the toes of a local power broker who wants to destroy an entire residential area and build a winery there.","popularity":0.88,"poster_path":"/xTy2A6cHXAnDZIdy9CSuSlsbxaP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86842,"logo_path":"/uCPNeQLSVrSsOtLejsNRZTvnFab.png","name":"Sreda","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":119413,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Plus","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silver Spoon Goes South","video":false,"vote_average":5.625,"vote_count":3}
