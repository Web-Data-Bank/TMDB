Fisher is a feature documentary about the exciting life and lasting impact of the intrepid mid-century California food writer M.F.K. Fisher, who elevated cooking from a domestic chore to a critical study of life itself. Described by W.H. Auden as “the best prose writer in America,” the underrecognized Fisher introduced continental sensibilities to California’s burgeoning culinary world, while she transformed the traditional background figure of a woman in the kitchen into a living, breathing subject with dazzling ideas, passionate emotions, and insatiable appetites.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Eating: The Life of M.F.K.
