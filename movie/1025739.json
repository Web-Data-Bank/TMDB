Dead As A Dodo lays bare the settler colonial mythology at the heart of the  popular narrative of the Dodo’s extinction, drawing on archival material and in conversation with a book of poems titled A Theory of Birds by the Palestinian-American  poet Zaina Alsous. Lines from this collection and a zoological study of the Dodo (1848) have  been collaged into a cento to narrate the fictions (of race, name, and value) that enshrine settler  colonial imaginaria over and above living in “co-dignity” with the land.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r8BSATj0Nt8V3kEQUULpd7tAmxE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SD","name":"Sudan"}],"release_date":"2022-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead as a Dodo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
