Animals is a concept album, focusing on the social-political conditions of mid-1970s Britain, and was a change from the style of the bandâ€™s earlier work. The album was developed from a collection of unrelated songs into a concept which describes the apparent social and moral decay of society, likening the human condition to that of animals. Inspired by George Orwell's Animal Farm.
