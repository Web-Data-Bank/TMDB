After surviving the devastation of the Blitzkrieg, Karski swears allegiance to the Polish Underground and risks his life to carry the first eyewitness reports of war-torn Poland to the Western world, and ultimately, the Oval Office. Escaping a Gestapo prison, bearing witness to the despair of the Warsaw ghetto and confronted by the inhumanity of a death camp, Karski endures unspeakable mental anguish and physical torture to stand tall in the halls of power and speak the truth.","popularity":0.647,"poster_path":"/piVQua4LqtVVtc1VCgzn1DCU62r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of a man who told of humanity's greatest crimes while there was still time to stop them.","title":"Remember This","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
