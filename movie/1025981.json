Nearly every musician interviewed talks about experiencing anti-Asian racism while growing up. Bald shows how defensive identification with England's black population led them to embrace reggae and hip-hop in addition to Indian sounds like Bollywood sound track music, bhangra, and Indian classical music. A passing moment of attention from the mainstream media and major record labels has embittered some of the performers but left others more focused and still hopeful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mutiny: Asians Storm British Music","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
