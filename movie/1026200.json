This film traces the history of anthropological depictions of the dance and, through the return of archival materials to a First Nations community, presents some of the ways in which diverse attitudes toward this history inform current performances of the Hamat'sa. With a secondary focus on the filmmaker's fieldwork experience, the film also attends specifically to the ethics of ethnographic representation and to the renegotiation of relationships between anthropologists and their research partners.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8CijqEGNt9dlJE4tC7OIiKgfeE9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of the Hamat'sa: A Tale of Headhunting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
