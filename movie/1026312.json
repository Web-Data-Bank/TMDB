The film connects the spaces of our lives and of our sensible experiences with geological phenomena of immeasurable temporality. The layers of memory, whether they are contained in the rock or in our cells, are part of a cycle from sedimentation to disintegration. The work invites us to apprehend these processes with attention and empathy in order to consider their slowness as a means to heal even the deepest fractures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jkEzfcVkvgtxOShyf5mHWAJ1oHK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le désert mauve","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corps Minéral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
