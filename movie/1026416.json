Stew-masters from far and wide in Georgia gather--and often stew-masters from Virginia too whenever a \"Stew War\" competition and stew cook-off occurs--gather and compete for awards for best stew under a strict \"Cook Off Rules.\" A panel of judges is invited to sample-taste the stews and vote for the ones they prefer. After learning that folklorist Dr. John Burrison was invited to be a judge at the festival, Stan asked Burrison, who had served as advisor on a number of his films, to join him as he documented the festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stewbilee","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
