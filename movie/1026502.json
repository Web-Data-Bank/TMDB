It navigates images and ideas of masculinity and trans masculine identity, combining found footage, illustration and personal archive in an act of assemblage that mirrors the erratic and eternal piecing together of a queer identity. The film attempts to trace a story of becoming, the active process of stitching oneself together from a myriad of starting points, whilst also laying bare the moments of conflict and interruption that occurs from this process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"commes tous les garçons","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
