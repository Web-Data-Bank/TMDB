As always, Rick seeks out enticing fishing opportunities and is on the hunt for the most tantalising seafood - but this journey is different to most because it is one that is very close to Rick's heart. Although Rick has always known he was of German descent, he knows very little of his German family - but the one thing he is sure of is that he wouldn't have the business he has today without them. In the early 70s, he inherited Â£10,000 from a great uncle that he never knew, money that provided him with a great investment in his restaurant.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rlEJsJM8J1JB3zLf40NcpP34rrr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rick Stein's German Bite","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
