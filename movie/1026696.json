While they train, we learn about their lives growing up amid segregation and stigma before breaking boundaries in their adopted hometown Chicago. A decade after joining Team Dream, a Chicago-based organization training women of color in swimming, biking and triathlon, the two women continue to reach goals they never thought possible. When Misha, a former Division I swimmer, helps them with their starts and turns, the women help her find her way outside the pool. The film culminates with Ann and Madeline competing at the games in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. TEAM DREAM shows you're never too old to dream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u2QhwyXInRdWE8UZTdqJy8G91KU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Team Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
