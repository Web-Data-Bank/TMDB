Backed by the BBC Concert Orchestra, she celebrates the legendary female voices that have shown her the wayâ€”artists such as Nina Simone, Shirley Bassey, Billie Holiday, Etta James, and Gladys Knight. From showtunes to pop, from soul to French chanson, Erivo delivers big, iconic anthems of love, loss, and transformation. Andi Oliver presents from the Royal Albert Hall in London, and is joined by special guests Clarke Peters and Ayanna Witter-Johnson.","popularity":0.909,"poster_path":"/tqyVlF6pRLNv9sfYu585FujtxiF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Livewire Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cynthia Erivo: Legendary Voices at the Proms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
