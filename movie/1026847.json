I don't understand anything\". 8 people read aloud private texts (sms, letters, emails) written or received by Daphné Hérétakis in the months leading up to her 26th birthday. The film proposes to take these texts out of the realm of intimacy and put them back into the public space and the collective nature of the film. The result is a romantic and absurd cadavre exquis, which addresses slightly depressed sensibilities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fY1P8hNQiccgdvfskFVwhayFOm7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"26","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
