In this dual storyline (in color and monochrome) it's difficult to tell who the real monsters are: the backstabbing \"friends\" in the color sequences or the flesh-hungry, sex-crazed zombies in the black-and-white sequences. Friends reveal their monstrous sides. Elusian is the chrome-dome club-kid, and DiGiorno, Elusian's ex-lover, is emotionally stunted and can only communicate and perceive life through sex. A tale of coitus, cat-fighting and conspiracy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dluTxqyiZGpeZOZwdiwTlnMdIs7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Twilight Come the Flesheaters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
