The hours that separate Sept-Îles from the dunes of Aguanish stretch out over the conversations. The car becomes a place of confession where the friends discuss their desire to reconnect with the region since leaving for their studies. Between spontaneous stops on the 138, the young women reflect on this quest for identity that accompanies the regional exodus. Their reflections take them on a journey beyond the road, into their teenage memories and future aspirations. It is the beginning of another season that reveals a decentralized social landscape of metropolises.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Jamais nulle part","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
