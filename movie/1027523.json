He executes his everyday life like any man - exercising at the gym, working as a nightclub bouncer and spending his spare time with those who just happened to end up around him. An ordinary day comes to a halt when he runs into a familiar woman - with whom he hasnâ€™t met before. The twosome develop an unprecedented sense of connection which makes them question everything they have believed in. As their self-evident future together starts to shine in the horizon, his repressed childhood enters from behind it. Encountering the past drives at stake both - the hopes for true love and his sense of reality.","popularity":0.762,"poster_path":"/b7wetO08f8gPGRI2YrLBINHoHpK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115405,"logo_path":"/oueZqRUrbPCvwDhWzg5LETIdZIb.png","name":"Cinemanifest","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":182866,"logo_path":"/z87POWQHFiLYNRhavztBzL72h1C.png","name":"Cinerain","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I do recognize a time traveller when i see one","title":"Timeman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
