Featuring Peter Sarstedt's Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)? - a number one in 1969 and a hit he never really matched, Trio's 1982 smash Da Da Da, Phyllis Nelson's 1985 lovers rock-style classic Move Closer, and The New Radicals' 1999 hit You Get What You Give.  We travel through the years selecting some of your favourite number ones and a few others that came close, revealing what's happened to the one-off hitmakers since and exploring the unwritten laws that help make sense of the one-hit wonder phenomenon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cVFTY57qS4mdz52vUyncO5RknsO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One-Hit Wonders At The BBC","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
