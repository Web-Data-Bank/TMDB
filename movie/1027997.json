DIANA, a video short documenting the arrival of controversial comic book artist and illustrator Michael Diana–the hottest astral flame to scorch New York City's creative underbelly–to New York City.  Mike's soft spoken, gentle character is in sharp contrast to the harsh illustrated images of bloody sexuality he creates.

The video features the \"three faces of Mike\": Artist, Political Scapegoat, and Object Of Desire. Explore the territory \"Inside Michael Diana\", as the film makers survey his surfer-buff physique.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/nyGPtPeMZIGwlvKXRclSfDCyul6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Introducing Mr. Diana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
