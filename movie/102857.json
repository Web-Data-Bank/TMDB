The Khmer Rouge’s reign of terror also decimated a homegrown film industry that had flourished since 1960: movie theaters were bombed, film prints were destroyed and artists were executed. In Golden Slumbers, French-Cambodian filmmaker Davy Chou mourns this loss of lives and culture, but balances the somber material with a playfulness that honors the lush melodramas and mythic adventures of the glory years.","popularity":0.908,"poster_path":"/wf0CsamCJaPlZGL3XiEbe5zXtbI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6301,"logo_path":"/jma8ZaHq1KAzlXW3v0RswVOWSdn.png","name":"CinéCinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":88971,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vycky Films","origin_country":""},{"id":26255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bophana Production","origin_country":""},{"id":88972,"logo_path":null,"name":"Araucania Films","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden Slumbers","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":9}
