Or so it seems. They recently celebrated ten years of marriage and are talking about starting a family. After a wine filled evening, Carrie's girlfriends press her to share who her \"hall pass\" would be. Carrie admits that she has had a crush on famed rocker, Dante Jones, since she was in college but would never betray Justin if given the opportunity. After a business trip to Vegas and a chance meeting with Dante himself after his concert, her obsession suddenly becomes his. Carrie does everything in her power to keep her secret away from her friends and more importantly, Justin, but Dante's stalking and relentless infatuation becomes all-consuming and far too dangerous to hide.","popularity":2.779,"poster_path":"/YoaNq0A0VPyA5zEtsbvy9cQCe8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7119,"logo_path":"/2aFVtrHVcqGOq1qwYlPZ7VQ67Oi.png","name":"Hybrid","origin_country":"US"},{"id":84293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mayor Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hall Pass Nightmare","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
