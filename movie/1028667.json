Through a meeting between three women, \"from soil to soul\" reflects on what it is like to be human today: The need to be in contact with nature, the urge to create something of your own and express yourself, and the desire for community and to feel alive. Together, the musicians Johanna and Marianna and the gardener Ana get time to stand still.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":183050,"logo_path":"/9s6QTzCUEO21bHXSQht1DuL6PCh.png","name":"Heapsgood Motion Pictures","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2022-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"from soil to soul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
