An unprecedented number of children were separated from their parents or orphaned. Under the guise of the best interests of these children and of the nation, France, the United States, Great Britain and the countries of Central Europe embarked on a veritable race for children. By demographic opportunism, by fear of seeing them indoctrinated by a new totalitarianism, these countries move and adopt these orphans, erasing their history and their identity.","popularity":0.7,"poster_path":"/IHQnj7TrIaHvSQuj0GEU3nbbkk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elephant Adventures","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vertigo Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104097,"logo_path":"/tzhYtZqLNn0TFEQ27dmT8qFTEA1.png","name":"Kwassa Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":161003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lutecia Film","origin_country":""},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of Chaos","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
