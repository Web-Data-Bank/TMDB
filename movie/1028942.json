It’s occurred for hundreds of years and is now ever present, and it is brutal and disgusting. Maria Campbell, an acclaimed Metis author from Saskatchewan, knows much about these sad realities in our communities.  In this work, Maria sets out to hold a mirror out for Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people to peer into the never-ending legacy of colonial violence.  In collaboration Shane Belcourt, the video is a series of heartbreaking vignettes, all wrapped around the imagery of a man in ceremony looking for hope and calling for the ancestors to help us all get back on the good road home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1RBDYNFMPpeoLCsZaIkn9uAKXzV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183098,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wolfwalker","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-10-25","revenue":47800000,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coming Home","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
