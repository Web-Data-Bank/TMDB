Here Jane returns to her childhood home with partner and bandmate Brian to revisit the people and places from her past. With its longstanding ban on automobiles and the daily onslaught of extreme winter weather, life for the few who live on the island year-round is not easy. FINKEL must embrace this unique lifestyle as they dive headfirst in the creative process once more. Their goal: write an album inspired by this extraordinary place. Navigating the joys and complexities of returning to a place frozen in the past, Jane and Brian immerse themselves in the sonic landscape of Mackinac and find inspiration for their new body of work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/krWVVhqa9UKx5syJZScKG6lOX3v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slow Blink","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Islanders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
