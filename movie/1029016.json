Her hair is extremely long and can reach far away outside of the tower. She starts to spin and rewind her locks in order to catch her unseen prince. As the spinning movement proceeds, Rapunzel becomes highly emotional. Eventually she loses sight of her initial aspiration and transforms into a mere yarn-ball-like, cocoon-like black mass. Meanwhile, the world outside of the tower is ruined by Rapunzel’s rampaging hair. The chaos created is as if some apocalyptic natural disaster has taken place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Catcher","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
