However, we find in it lots of elements of Tsai´s universe, including Lee Kang-sheng playing the dog which eats the moon. Note how the title (《月亮不見了》) echoes that of the short film The Skywalk is Gone (《天橋不見了》), shot a year later. The story is set during the Moon Festival, with many references to this festivity and its mythology.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moon is Gone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
