It follows eight fearless women who are subverting gender roles by redefining a masculine Portuguese tradition. Captured through the eyes of eight-year-old Leandra Peirera, Forcadas contrasts the vulnerability and fears of a young girl with the brutality of the fights. This short film explores both modernism and tradition within the Grupo de Forçados Femininos de Benavente and how they take life by the horns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gHDsPOrPYJouZkCwIMamgHik8gJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A celebration of the fearless women bull wrestlers of Portugal","title":"Forcadas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
