While shoes take over from clogs, Gonzo hasn’t been able to make money from his business and owes Zenzo, who controls the town. Taking advantage of it, Zenzo tries to sleep with Osei, to much resentment. Tired of their poor life and Zenzo, Osei suggests Gonzo they quit clog making and go live with her older brother who has a business in Osaka, but Gonzo doesn’t agree from his pride as an artisan, and from lack of money to travel. So Osei plans to make money to get out of the town by pretending she’s dead and receiving condolence money from Zenzo. Hearing the news from Gonzo, Zenzo rushes to their house, but as he sees Osei lying on the futon, he realizes she’s not dead. Gonzo keeps drinking as it’s poured, as Zenzo has planned. His intention is to take Osei, while a drunk Gonzo sleeps.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sVawWFHwQifLXyeBGvX7ogq9fjz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I want you to tease, not to trick you into getting hurt.","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
