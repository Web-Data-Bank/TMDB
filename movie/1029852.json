But it’s not the ensemble’s success that makes the story insightful, but the difficult path that the guys had to go to achieve it. Concert bans, distrust of the party, problems with the institute, breath-taking popularity and, finally, the most difficult choice between science and art, will make the audience really worry about every step of the founders of Dos-Mukassan. A genuine, sincere friendship between the main characters of the story, which one day will be in jeopardy, will keep in suspense throughout the journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/klMkLf6shddkhtdVzMJqDDOEbk6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2022-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dos-Mukasan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
