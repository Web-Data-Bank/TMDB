At a temple in Kyoto, a Zen priest contemplates the metaphysical immortality held within a single breath.  Some years ago, filmmaker Spencer Macdonald read an article in The New York Times titled \"Can a Jellyfish Unlock the Secret of Immortality?\" by Nathaniel Rich. Comprehensive and insightful, the article is compelling not least for its potential to deliver a revelation that defies one of life’s most fundamental truths; that we all live then die. It also shines a light on the arrogance of the anthropocene, the evolving landscape of Shirahama, and a detailed insight into the life and work of the charming and fervently curious Dr. Shin Kubota, a warm and eccentric scientist determined to harness the biological secrets of a jellyfish for humanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ba8MWh8RrGuAnzX9CQwx9fQT0oR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Meditations on life and immortality with scientist Shin Kubota and Zen abbess Koju Kaji","title":"Scarlet Medusa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
