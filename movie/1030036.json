French is on the verge of extinction. Two filmmakers, David Simard and Christian Fleury, continue the investigation they began the previous year on its imminent death with \"Everyone Wants to be a Cajun\". Two intellectuals, who both hold the French fact in Louisiana dear to their hearts, face each other in a virtual dialogue to explain the situation. One would like to see the rise of a new united and modern francophone community, while the other represents the majority view of those children who are today fully Americanised. The social and political contradictions that have historically divided them - and that continue to divide them - reveal themselves in the space between their narratives. To complement the dialogue, members of the community, helplessly witnessing the demise of French, add a poetic touch to the film by providing us, with a hint of nostalgia, the last traces of the dialect their forbearers spoke.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t7xWWUHxoeH4gHv7A9P1lxkV8GP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everybody Wants to be a Cajun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
