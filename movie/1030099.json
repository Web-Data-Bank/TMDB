It was the realization of a campaign promise by François Mitterrand. For four decades, homosexuals had been confined to the disavowal of their entourage, to clandestinity and to police harassment, and now they can finally live in the open. It took more than 15 years of struggles, heated debates and demonstrations to rally intellectuals and politicians to their cause. Activists, ministers and parliamentarians testify to their commitment to overcome the last barriers of a hostile society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oxiidhiJJhZJ7v5WVToZS6leavJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homosexualité : la fin du placard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
