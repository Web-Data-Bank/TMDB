The story begins with an honest exploration of how BIPOC communities have, through the lasting lineage of colonialism, been systematically excluded from outdoor spaces. The characters then share their resilient and joyful stories of reconnection and healing as they rally the outdoor industry to create a truly inclusive outdoor culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Expedition Reclamation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
