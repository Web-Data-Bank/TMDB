Gilbert decides to kill himself and heads to the mall to buy rope. While there, he discovers how expensive it is to take a picture with the mall Santa and decides on one last act of goodwill — dressing up like Santa himself and offering poor families (“with only one car”) the opportunity to take a picture with him for free. His suicide plans are delayed even further when he’s propositioned mysteriously by an odd fellow to come to his home and help out his wife.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jXa3l0S3ZDbNFYPL3HFyh5Zenzu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gilbert refuses to have a sad Christmas this year.","title":"Gilbert's Little Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
