Crossing its own borders in to new zones, it absorbs its founders and mutates in to something absolutely new. In this new world real wars look like a game on americasarmy.com. Prison torture appears more like the sadistic exercises of modern-day valkyries. Technologies and materials transform the artificial environment in to a fantasy landscape of a new epoch. This paradise is a mutated world where time is frozen and the past is neighbor to the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uD8IpdcbxZ2VvBmVrXNMX2izEis.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183362,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triumph Gallery (Moscow)","origin_country":""},{"id":183363,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moscow Multimedia Center for Actual Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Riot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
