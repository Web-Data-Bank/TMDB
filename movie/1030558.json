I was born and raised in the city. Although I am Zhuang (China’s ethnic group), am I Beixnuengx? I want to ﬁnd my identity. So I started with Zhuang folk songs. I set oﬀ from Nanning to Wuming, Baise, and then to Mashan, my hometown that I have never been to. I met people singing songs in WeChat groups; I joined the Zhuang song festival at the entrance of the village, I visited 100-year-olds who still make Zhuang brocade... What are the stories of those singing folk songs? What Beixnuengx culture is revealed in folk songs? Along the way, I slowly uncovered the much advertised Zhuang culture and saw her in the most original form. In the end, how did I answer my initial question?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aW06bSUINu1SryPiX9QV7aPVu3s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I AM ZHUANG","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
