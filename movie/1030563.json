She is at times conciliatory, playful, teasing, remorseful, sad, manipulative, depressed, understanding, patient, desperate, manipulative, cloying, and finally accepting of his final farewell. It seems her lover has now found a younger more accomadating woman who will supersede the main character. It is quite sad how he has toyed with her over the years and the efforts she takes to please him, when clearly to him she is just a garment to put on when convenient or to use when lonesome and he really does not care for her. Very well written and acted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z4T0NKs9OXtdAdJOMJwkNfbaMo7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1978-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Voce Umana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
