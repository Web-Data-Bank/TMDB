Although Kristijan is in a coma, Lara starts to receive video clips from his Facebook profile, showing unidentified persons watching him get beaten. She reports this to detective Borut (Jure Henigman, from A Trip and Dual), who starts an investigation. All the observers, who appear in the video clips, will become Lara’s nightmare in her real life. She soon realizes that she is also an accomplice in this horrible event.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Staragara","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":54760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaval Film","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":46286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Propeler Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Observing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
