But reality sometimes teaches us something different- totally overcrowded resorts, the best lines are already taken by others, the 'secret spot’ was also hit by someone else, and the waitress in the bar just dated your best friend. No wonder that you get a little 'snowbored’ once in a while.  But Snowbored? is anything else than boring! This movie, brought to you by the guys from mellow mood productions out of switzerland, is about to show you that all the waiting for the perfect day is worth it. Riders like Markus Keller, Gian Simmen, Danny Kass, Stephan Maurer, Jon Cartwright and others will show their skills in every terrain you could imagine and will make you long for the next season to come!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q1Vh5JS3rdrG71bUV1cIHEOGqAq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mellow Mood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snowbored?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
