Born in Belfast to an Italian mother and a Southern Irish father, Lia holds British, Irish and Italian passports. Northern Ireland is the weirdest corner of the UK – or Ireland – depending on who you talk to! A tribal place where the locals can't even agree on the name – be it Northern Ireland or Northern Ireland – is a place where identity is everything. British or Irish, Protestant or Catholic? But what will being Irish mean to Lia's generation, born long after the Good Friday Agreement? What does the conflict mean for immigrants who choose to live in Northern Ireland? And as Covid slowly recedes after two difficult years, what will be the long-term effects for those born during the pandemic? How are we going to explain this strange time to them for years to come?","popularity":0.67,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lettera a Lia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
