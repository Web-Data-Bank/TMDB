Thus was created a Muslim majority state of Punjab (west) in Pakistan and a Hindu /Sikh majority state of Punjab (east) in India. For the people of Punjab, it created a paradoxical situation they had never experienced before: the self became the Other. The universe of a shared way of life -- Punjabiyat — was marginalised. It was replaced by perceptions of contending identities through the two nation states. For most of us this has been the narrative of Punjab-- once known as the land of five waters, now a cultural region spanning the border between Pakistan and India.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xmReMIm4mVWhdtyjb4F3d6NXEFX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let’s Meet At Baba Ratan’s Fair","title":"Milange Babey Ratan De Mele Te","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
