About 10 people responded to the offer. Then, they decided the day in charge at the monthly meeting, and started joint childcare \"Chinbotsukazoku\" at an apartment in Higashinakano in Tokyo. It was Tsuchi Kanou, the director of this film, who was raised there. When he graduated from college, he met people who had raised himself, heard stories, and made films.
