Yanagisawa introduces us to each of the film's subjects in a similar manner: 51 year old Kayo for instance, who fends off everyone with a bamboo stick. The community came into existence quite gradually, inspired by an exchange set up by some of the parents. Overcoming the objections of the local government association, the residents move into a rented building and, working with their guidance staff, they decide to create a facility based on plans they themselves have drawn up. The group then figures out who should be assigned what task as they remodel and finally complete work on the building turning it into a communal work place they dub \"Popeye House.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not That Way but This","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
