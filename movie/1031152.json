There is hope in this movie ; hope prompted in part by the surprize of finding such a delicate beauty in the midst of such harsh climatic conditions. The movie is intimate in it's close up detail of flowers and leaves and this fragile beauty is made the more poignant by the sound mix which, foregrounds the vast and hostile expanses of the burning desert winds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desert Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
