Discos esenciales: Artaud","overview":"Directed by the pianist Hernán Jacinto and the singer Loli Molina, an avant-garde album by Spinetta is recreated: Artaud, recorded in 1973. The concert takes place within the framework of the cycle Luis Alberto Spinetta: Essential Records, dedicated to revisiting his productions that left a trace in the collective memory.  Considered a cult work, the album –signed by Pescado Rabioso, but designed and recorded by Luis Alberto Spinetta– has been studied in essays, research books and documentaries. From the poetics and sound of the nine songs to the jagged shape of the cover, it marked a breaking point in rock.  Artaud is performed in their original order. In addition to Jacinto and Molina, the concert features the participation of Juan Pablo Arredondo on guitar, Diana Arias on double bass and Hernán Hecht on drums. And luxury guests are added: the Uruguayan singer Fernando Cabrera, the interpreter Noelia Recalde and the singer and guitarist Mat Alba.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yjEijUG5gNOHugLZGiUronchAhT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spinetta.
