An outsider, Alberich stumbles upon them and an opportunity to make his life matter, but at a cost. Meanwhile, Leader Wotan desperate to hang on to the Gods’ fading glory, struggles to balance power, his own laws and the standards of public life.  Birmingham Opera Company, known for staging opera in empty warehouses and disused factories, here performs RhineGold in the relatively conventional surroundings of Birmingham Symphony Hall. The production is from August 2021 with the pandemic still dictating so much of our lives. This is an urban RhineGold; Rhinemaidens are selfie-taking party girls, Alberich is cycle courier, and Wotan is first seen giving a press conference for FNN: Fake News Network. This RhineGold, complete with the new English translation by Jeremy Sams, can be seen as a step closer to Wagner’s vision of a total work of art acting as a lever of change in society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c7mhtMEVApkOvnsCBfpph5q2lAa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rhinegold - BOC","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
