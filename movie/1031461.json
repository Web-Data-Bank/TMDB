The same challenge for him is to express how reality is perceived and experienced by a visually impaired person. Ševčíková therefore does not explain the blindness. Using everyday situations as examples, she empathetically and without pathos presents the stories of six people who never stop dreaming, yearning, and searching for ways to be as free in life as the sighted majority. They find sources of energy in work, sports, dance, and relationships. We are also transported into their world by the dimly lit black and white camera and the layered soundtrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/DPWPGS0sxowp1c27DlAjyZwBi6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33214,"logo_path":null,"name":"i/o post","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":118229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amp - Studio Virtual","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Who Dance in the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
