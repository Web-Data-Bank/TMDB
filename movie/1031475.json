Many teenage sex comedies were made in the 1980's and have long disappeared from the public consciousness (mostly for the betterment of mankind) yet CAVEGIRL is released constantly on DVD and remains a fan favorite. CAVEGIRL, A SECOND JOURNEY back in time is a unique and fascinating look into the creative process of this late night staple.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/adE9p1vJckyiTBAMDOxXSAEcU0i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Second Journey Back in Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
