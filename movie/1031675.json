The conversation with Müller revolves around Tacitus' representation of the Roman Empire around 112 AD. First, Müller reads passages from the historicist's annals that describe Tiberius' tragic death (37 AD). Kluge and Müller discuss the text's aesthetic qualities. Müller is interested in Tacitus for the aesthetic pleasures rather than out of historical curiosity. He describes Tacitus' style as \"transition from chronicle to literature,\" which manifests in his \"elliptical,\" sometimes laconic narration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rome, as Far Away as the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
