Everyone ignores him except Kurt, a slick, fast-talking, completely untrustworthy guy who seems like all the used-car salesmen in Ohio put together. He offers Billy a cheeseburger for washing his car. No problem. That accomplished, Kurt ups the stakes by offering Billy an option to do another errand for a steak dinner. The tasks seem innocuous, but Billy begins to show up on many security cameras, and Kurt's requests get stranger and stranger, the stakes higher and higher, until there's a final, irrevocable task. Cleveland landmarks look refreshing in this feature film, and the camera picks up other corners of the city you may have never seen.â€”David Jones","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Will Work For Food","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
