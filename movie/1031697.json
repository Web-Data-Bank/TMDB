Aguilera brought the nostalgia as she was joined by Mya for a rendition of Moulin Rouge!‘s “Lady Marmalade.” She also brought out pop star Kim Petras for a performance of her song “XXX” and Paris Hilton to perform her hit “Stars Are Blind”.  The performance featured a closet’s worth of stunning Pride flag-colored outfits that she switched in and out of as she belted out her classic hits like the 2003 orchestral-tinged arena rock song “Fighter.” Xtina also shouted out her LGBTQ+ fans with a montage that ferociously came after Florida’s state legislature for its atrocious “Don’t Say Gay” bill. It was iconic, to say the least.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qmYqeUSFTor8wGu82hemaCXegDu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Christina Aguilera - LA Pride","title":"Christina Aguilera - LA Pride","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
