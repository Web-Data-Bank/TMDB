The female-centric genre film is lensed in the wife’s evolving perspective as she slowly comes to see what is happening to her and finds the support to fight back. Visually mesmerizing and emotionally arresting, the film’s pace and pathos pull us into a story that will feel uncomfortably familiar to too many of us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hide","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":8}
