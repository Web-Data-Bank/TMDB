Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band","overview":"Written in 1967, Sgt. Pepper’s was the world’s first concept album. The Beatles went into the studio, enthusiastically embracing the possibilities for experimentation that were blossoming at the time, and with no intention of playing the album live. Firstly, because they just didn’t feel like it (due to the hordes of screeching fans), but also because it was music that supposedly couldn’t be performed on stage, as it was too complicated. But that music just had to be played live at some point! Now The Analogues’ perform this masterwork live in all its analogue glory—an honor for which no effort has been spared with regards to a truckload of wild and wonderful vintage instruments. There’s a sitar and tabla drums for ‘Within You, Without You’, a rare Lowrey keyboard for ‘Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds’; a harp for ‘She’s Leaving Home’, plus, of course, a huge array of strings and horns. This is The Analogue’s quest to faithfully perform Sgt. Pepper’s live!...as The Beatles never intended.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qyzLhXnAcmkLyKMmBozAlp75iev.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Over Easy B.V. - Amsterdam","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sgt.
