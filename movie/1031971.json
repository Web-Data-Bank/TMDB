This counts especially for Mahler's enigmatic sixth symphony, an emotionally stirring challenge for both performers and listeners, while also one of the most impressive works in musical history. Chailly's interpretation with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra is 'intensely great' (Die Presse). 'Chailly uncompromisingly considers this sixth symphony through the lens of modernity; looking forward, not retrospectively staying in late romantic. In this celebrated orchestra, all sections splendidly come together and fulfill an 'open' sound, conserving whilst respecting its original beauty' (Salzburger Nachrichten).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oOGTVl6pQxaqcm8cGJ4WZb12Df8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gustav Mahler - Symphony No. 6 (Gewandhaus Orchestra Leipzig, Riccardo Chailly)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
