I shot 8mm footage during the state of emergency in Japan and just after moving back to Taiwan. I then spent several months cutting and pasting each 8mm frame onto 16mm film. Sometimes the daily fragments were too sentimental, but the film gave me shelter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2021-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flight and Frame","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
