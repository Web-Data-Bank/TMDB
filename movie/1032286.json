Sam refuses to let his life-changing spinal cord injury become a barrier to the many outdoor sports that he loves. Sam's most recent athletic obsession is surfing, and since existing adaptive surfboards don't work with his high level of paralysis, he's learning to craft his own. Beyond the Break follows Sam as he designs and builds a new board to tackle the unpredictable waves of the Pacific Northwest. Sam's story is one of tenacity, ingenuity and refusing to accept limitations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/932OPxmj5sPjXNasIaw6KLT5tpA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Break: The Sam Danniels Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
