Max Ryder is an up and coming gogo dancer that is willing to do anything to get the best sets and music. A dance club DJ, Pierre Fitch, has the power to give a dancer great sets and even better music. These three guys are friends, enemies, fighters, and lovers brought together by their passion for nightlife and their desire to get ahead - whatever it takes. With an all-star supporting cast including Gabriel Clark, Sebastian Young and Tommy Defendi as rival club owners, Seth Knight as an entrepreneurial young dancer, and Stephen Forest as a sweetly na√Øve iPad boy, Project Gogo Boy defies convention while blurring the line between fantasy and reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t5sNGiHMqPNYNf5jZYXGVzE2M91.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78808,"logo_path":"/waBhPFHbQyMCHBjUBQJospx6DiJ.png","name":"Cocky Boys","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Project Gogo Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
