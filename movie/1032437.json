Directed by David Donnelly (Maestro, 2015), this fast-paced documentary explores the notion of success and excellence from the female perspective. It challenges the popular and perhaps somewhat outdated notions of success in classical music through a fast-paced narrative of three female artists. A young Norwegian violinist on the brink of stardom, a cultural entrepreneur and mother of three who reinvents the traditional concert experience to inspire the younger audience, and a first-generation American from Argentina, whose creative process of composing a film soundtrack is documented and exposed in an unprecedented way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
