At the same time, he dearly loves poetry and people who are somehow connected with poetry. He loves the Perm prison region – where the authorities, without particularly delving into details, pushed poets and murderers. He writes a book of salty jokes about these people called \"Perm region\". In the company of random fellow travelers, he goes to Pasternak places in the Urals, forcing landscapes and voices to sound differently, and thereby creates an informal, lively guide to the Kama region.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Permshchik Robert Belov","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
