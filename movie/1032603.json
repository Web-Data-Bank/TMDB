The story takes place in hotel rooms, overflowing with chaos and the genius of Joe. A hotel room that are many and that, in turn, contains the agony of the genius who sabotages everything he loves to remain free.","popularity":5.379,"poster_path":"/1oNa6Zdb2lWJl6RCYEA4nWmphWf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118433,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhayuela Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rebellion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
