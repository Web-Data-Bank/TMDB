The film is \"compressed\" like a work by Arman or Caesar. But unlike the work of these artists who compressed usual objects, this self-compression reduces a purely artistic object.  The tour de force and the bet of Compression de À travers l'universe was to make a total compression: in this film, there is no lack of a single shot of the original film!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3V0FAYy2PRmLDfpcm5xP6E2RPDZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Compression de À travers l'univers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
