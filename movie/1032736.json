Now, they are tired of self-dissing mixed with resentment against the club and players.  But, why can't they leave even though they know? Why won't the 'Talde effect' work?

Now here, nevertheless, with fans moving to Sajik Baseball Stadium, the 40-year history of the Giants unfolds centered on former and current Lotte Giants players.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yovRcHc0IGysgZb602Q8DGXizzL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7819,"logo_path":"/ghFZAt4edln0M7BzDExyYMzUGX1.png","name":"Lotte Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giants Even If We Die","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
