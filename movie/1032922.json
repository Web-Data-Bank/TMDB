It is not the intestines that emerge from his abdominal cavity, but skeins of film. For cinephiles of new generations, this is a truly encyclopedic sketch about the technology of cinematic nature. Double exposure reprises; silhouettes in the negative (meaning not a bad mood, but a film original); editing with barbaric scissors â€“ the character on the screen loses half of the body; there are gastric wastes in the form of a silent movie film with a silent hero.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinemalgie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
