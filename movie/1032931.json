Together with the heroes, we walk around Moscow at night, go on an ethnographic expedition, attend a rehearsal. We live this hour with unusual people for whom folklore has become something more than just music. The picturesque landscapes give way to the naughty dance of youth; the grandmothers' song takes us deep into the past and seems so close and so dear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Native Music","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
