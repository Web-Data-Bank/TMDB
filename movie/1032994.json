Molcars have round eyes, big soft butts, and short arms and legs as they trot along. They run around with a silly look on their face, and even when you're stuck in traffic, you can be put at ease just by gazing at the guinea pig butt in front of you! Even if they cause a bit of trouble, it's easy to forgive them because they're so cute and fluffy! This is an animation focusing on various situations unique to cars, full of satisfaction, friendship, adventure, crazy action, and tons of guinea pigs!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r0fKOGXv1k4zhZCY6qyk788KHoa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5141,"logo_path":"/fK2QKfHdSdw42Xx4MiD7KhDufBV.png","name":"Shin-Ei Animation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":178216,"logo_path":"/5j6atGkrqyaAlLH7HLBm7dh1n4R.png","name":"Japan Green Hearts","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pui Pui Molcar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
