Although this cinematic portrayal focuses primarily on the artistic pursuits of the protagonist — who reminisces with slight improvisation his years at the conservatoire and his performances with his band Pražský výběr — the film also maps his political and personal milestones and conveys his current world views and personal reflections on historical and political events. The documentary is playful and spontaneous and features dynamic shots with rock music that has stood the test of time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6U5ufrrKBlskEUJEyT7MWKaJrfI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MICHAEL KOCÁB - ROCKER VS.
