Their childish routine of roaming streets, riding scooters and vaping will change so soon — only Slava stays in Yuryevets with his foster family, most of his friends are leaving to study or work in a week.  Vlad dreams about a military career. He wants “to save lives” just like characters in his favorite computer games and to earn enough money for his poor parents who work in a local supermarket. At his birthday party the teens argue and try to dissuade Vlad but he has already made his choice.
