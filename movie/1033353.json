However, doctors are unanimous: they do not give a physiological reason for this comatose state, so they conclude that it is of a psychological nature. Bruno Aleixo, an assumed hater of the Christmas spirit, simply refuses to wake up. Using the recognized archetype of Charles Dickens' Christmas Tale, sleeping Bruno Aleixo relives, in dreams, several traumatic Christmases of the past, present and future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bMxwaAargxwDbmNScs2kieAdkbH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9020,"logo_path":"/qAcfiiC2WPGrfotZPnoHkDtQ6lr.png","name":"O Som e a Fúria","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Natal do Bruno Aleixo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
