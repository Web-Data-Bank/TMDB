The story is told through the eyes of Alex Gonzalez, a pothead who is kidnapped by his best friend Chris during a minor drug transaction and forced to be a PA on the set of an ultra low budget movie. Alex has no idea what a PA does or what it takes to make a movie but he has common sense, which is lacking heavily on this set. Chris promises Alex that he'll drive him home as soon as they get the first shot completed; but for this feature, getting anything in the can is a major task.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u8wsi1jwEupX3eMOPmf2pJ1VoqH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do It in Post","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
