He has a love interest in Suhana (Rumana), who has a friend, Tulip (Apu Biswas). Tulip's father (Shohel Rana) wants to get her married to her cousin (Misha Sawdagor), who is a rowdy, which she doesn't like. Tulip's paternal-grandfather bluffs to the family that she has already fallen in love with a guy in the city. Suhana helps Tulip by renting Rimaan as her would-be, just to let her escape the wedding situation for the time being. Just as things cool down, Tulip's suitor takes her away by force, only to be chased by Rimaan. Rimaan finally beats up her suitor into submission and leaves with her, but another problem arises when Rimaan has to decide between Suhana, whom he dated, and Tulip, who falls for him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ts029axCEzmFQS6h0L4NzxfDbR8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"2012-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":157,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buk Fatey To Mukh Foteyna","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
