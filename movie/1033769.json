In May 2001, an audacious robbery of a collection car of one of the commercial banks of Almaty took place. During this attack, which took place 50 meters from the American embassy in Almaty, several people were killed. The attackers managed to seize the sum of 700 thousand dollars, after which they carried out a number of raids on exchange offices and organizations of the southern capital. The crime was solved fairly quickly, but it remained for a long time, both in the memory of citizens and law enforcement officers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":318,"logo_path":"/q0UG4oZERwIywJdDPF4lRlvdYGW.png","name":"CTB Film Company","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2011-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Days in May","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
