The idea is if she sees him she will be disillusioned. A few hunters spying the \"wolves\" shoot with intent to kill, and a real bear enters the hut and scatters the plotters. The scheme works well, even with all these inconveniences, until a genuine Mountie appears on the scene and administers punishment to the arch-villain and his dwarf-like henchman. As a result the girl's romantic imagination vindicates her beau ideal. The two lovers are last seen standing chest-deep in the snow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Christie Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1922-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cold Feet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
