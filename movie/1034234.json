Each of the two videos is a replacement of the famous  videos of Ricardo Lopez, the so-called Bjork stalker who in 1996 filmed himself  in his house while building a bomb to send to the Icelandic singer, with  whom he was obsessed. Twenty hours of videos shot over 9 months in  which his thoughts, his daily life and his activities are documented in a sort  of ante litteram vlog. The best of me shows two sides of the footage that are  often ignored: on one hand its experimentation with the device, its use of  the video camera as an expression of the self; on the other hand, the few  moments in which Lopez does not speak and stops to reflect. Together, the  two projections account for a material of great theoretical interest that goes  beyond the simple initial shock.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yhExTFVbOJ44bMFHS0XdkuETBG1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE BEST OF ME","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
