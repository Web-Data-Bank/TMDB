Each chapter shows a different research  session in which the landscape is analyzed in its structure through individual  shots, thus forming a naturalist mosaic that accounts for the different  conformations of the territory over the years. This first part collects the documentation  of the place made by me between 2017 and 2021, as well as a  couple of found footage sequences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kscKul63Yzsaa0MMHGzh1PZnV5T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Piave","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
