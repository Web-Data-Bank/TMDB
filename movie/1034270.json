The film is set against the backdrop of a contentious 2020 Presidential election, nationwide social unrest, and a global pandemic. Tens of millions of Americans are living in a state of fear, isolation, and grief, while reckoning with historical truths, civil unrest, and the unfathomable loss of so many lives. And yet, despite the obstacles they are confronted with, their collective testimonies paint a mosaic of a country that is as rich and varied as its people, bringing hope to the promise of America, to help heal the wounds of a fractured nation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cuubg2T8t4C0jjO24ca7mcq9h5a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something in the Water","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
