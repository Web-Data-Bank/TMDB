Almost all families have or had a vineyard and women have played a fundamental and active role in the sector which hasn't always been recognised. From the oldest who didn't have a choice, to the current who had it, different generations of women reflect on how the role of women in the vitivinicultural sector has been and in which way it has influenced their lives and in the culture and traditions of their village. A place that wouldn't have been the same without them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h312abdHANyA8dbrbJoHoXekM2q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of the women of San Martín de Unx","title":"Y a la viña también","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
