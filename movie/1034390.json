If the government decides to prosecute you and you have to plea for your own innocence without having the evidence?  Peter Putker’s wife Durdana lost her life while sailing along the coast of Colombia. And although Peter states from the very beginning that they were attacked by pirates, the local authorities do not buy in his innocence. For them, he is the one who murdered his own wife. Problem is: only Peter himself was there and truly knows what happens. The Colombian authorities assign the case to the Dutch court. What happens when only you know the truth and any evidence supporting your innocence is lacking?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6hk1SGrG7x6ou0YV9Iyy6kUuSnL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239,"logo_path":null,"name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":4508,"logo_path":"/sUq2S2ndKxp1B2NjbMJbSNlPI8V.png","name":"Nederlands Fonds voor de Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lazy Duck","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
