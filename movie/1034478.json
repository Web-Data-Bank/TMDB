The camera pans swiftly from left to right, looking at what´s going on. The beat sets the tempo. The car´s put into gear: Take-off.  The story plays out in the viewers´ head rather than in front of their eyes. [n:ja] shows nothing more than pure motion along spatial coordinates which is driven by Radian´s pulsing soundtrack. So much \"reality\" – in other words details, color and representation – has been removed from the original views of this ride that solely remnants and a basic structure comprise the video image. In the first \"shot\" we seem to recognize passers-by hurrying in different directions. The point-of-view moves in the opposite direction, following individuals until two parallel lines running from left to right enter the frame as a graphic element, seeming to set our eyes on a rail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jkbA1GjEw2XarCPgkbN9nL7ohr0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"frame","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
