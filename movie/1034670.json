On the one hand, this film partly falls under the genre where a specific point of view of a city, its existence and identity grows into a full character. On the other, also falls in line with the observational documentary practice without interviews, testimonies or voice overs. The film intends to discuss and question modern society values and human nature through a non-linear contemporary portrait of intimate life stories. Violence, education, health, poverty, the role of our institutions in the organization of life and the ethical and moral quality of our society represent the main body for reflection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fWhSB0qafbrkEkTGsxvUuG59B0m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129804,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fronteira Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2017-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cru","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
