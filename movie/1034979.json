Those we met are between 3 and 45 years old. They were born from a previous heterosexual union or they were adopted. Sometimes, their parents conceived them thanks to an anonymous sperm donation or by surrogate mother. They live in the city, in the suburbs or in the countryside and their parents are teachers, stewards or military. Children, teenagers, adults, they agreed to answer without pretense to the questions that are being debated today: Do the children of gays suffer in their evolution from the voluntary absence of a mother or a father? When they were conceived by a heterosexual couple, how do they live with the late coming out of one of their parents? How do they deal with the way society, school and friends look at them? How do they talk about their family? How do they construct their sexual identity and their sexuality? What kind of men and women do they become as adults?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/FgebxY70o2WDNM7c7LsELvK2Iq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Parents Are Gay","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
