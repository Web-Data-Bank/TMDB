And, recorded after 1966 (by which time the Beatles had decided to be a studio-only band), it has never been played live. Until now! The Analogues played and recorded it live, in Liverpool, and set themselves the goal to bring alive this diverse, possibly less-coherent album, but an album that many Beatles connoisseurs find to be the most interesting. Experience, now, the White Album brought to life; see and hear all the special instruments needed to reproduce the album with ‘Analogue Craftsmanship’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/knepV35g1V8qOp34Q2Vk6ugl32o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Over Easy B.V. - Amsterdam","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Analogues- The White Album Live!","title":"The Analogues- The White Album Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
