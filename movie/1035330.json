Blue is the liminal space where the motion traverses the static, painting meets cinema, and dynamic tension liberates dreams. Blue, in the film, is not a statement nor a colour, but rather the emergence of a feeling. An empty canvas for the viewer to engage within the contraction and expansion of the light flux.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Azul no Azul","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":3}
