When McLaughlin, now a professional track and field athlete for New Balance, made the Olympics for Team USA as a 16-year-old in 2016, she became the youngest track and field athlete to do so in more than 40 years. Three years later, the game-changer may become the best 400m hurdler the world has ever seen, but back in high school, she was very much still a normal teenager -- most of the time. McLaughlin gave FloTrack and MileSplit a tour of her New Jersey high school and reflected on her past and future in the sport of track and field in this exclusive documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":183939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Milesplit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sydney McLaughlin's Final Days In High School","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
