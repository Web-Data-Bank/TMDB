In any case, Marie feels Amelie. While the one sister is already on her way home from their birthday party, Marie, who stayed longer, suddenly collapses on the dance floor. That night, Amelie never arrives home and disappears without a trace. Her friend Jonas alerts the police the next morning, worried that something must have happened. Chief Inspector Ingo Thiel immediately begins the investigation, but for the time being he and his SOKO team are groping in the dark: no witnesses, no enemies, just an earring found in the park. But then Marie notices that something is missing from the couple's apartment: a striking patchwork blanket that Marie had given her sister. Thiel is certain: Jonas is hiding something. So does he have something to do with the disappearance of his girlfriend?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hRfKwGR00ifpcLPN7OOmZJBShLU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cin√©ma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wo ist meine Schwester?","video":false,"vote_average":5.25,"vote_count":4}
