One of those heroic researchers was Dr. Abraham Rossenvasser, a self-taught Egyptologist from a small, poverty-stricken Jewish colony in Argentina. While Rossenvasser’s expedition rescued thousands of historical treasures from imminent destruction, his story is not often told. In From Sudan to Argentina, Charlottesville-based filmmaker Ricardo Preve rescues the legacy of this forgotten figure, and ensures his deeply impactful work can be celebrated. Told largely through the eyes of Rossenvasser’s daughter, Dr. Elsa Rosenvasser Feher, this documentary shines a well-deserved spotlight on the remarkable efforts of a man who committed himself to preserving crucial parts of history for generations to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3Y2MBBVpdyKrz66WN7DJjLcnphX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Sudan to Argentina","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
