A Night of A Thousand Vampires teams the band with the cast of The Circus of Horrors for an evening of shock, awe, and a fierce live rampage through their 40-year rich catalogue. A true event from showmen supreme, it was a historic night in the history of a storied band and a memorable evening for fans and band alike. It was also a fond farewell for drummer Pinch, his final gig with The Dammed after 20 years.","popularity":1.453,"poster_path":"/AnW1AZfeKbjcoqQWYZbrYWFUKu1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gothic Manor","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Damned - A Night Of A Thousand Vampires Live In London","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
