A film that invents the opportunity to talk to a dead man, why yes, Camilo died, but his questions, his ideas and his effective love remain strong and powerful within Marta's life and political and artistic reflection. Who was Camilo Torres Restrepo? The documentary tries to answer this question by looking at Colombia today, analyzing it, and understanding it, perhaps a little more, in its inequalities and its constant violence. Perhaps this is the greatest legacy that Camilo left to those who are still alive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tMt7aByZako1oxuO6VWZfKCElMv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2022-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camilo Torres Restrepo, el amor eficaz","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
