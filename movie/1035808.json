He knew this peace wouldnâ€™t last, as an established rule granted him only three years before he would be hunted down. Surely enough, in the present day, Ares is visited by his brother and sister; who hold him captive in his own apartment and deliver a warning that he will soon be captured and tortured to a greater extent. His sister Maura offers him a chance to escape, but Ares decides to stay and wait for his punishment in order to protect Bennet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2fJrb3TKDvPawyE3HSKrLn7pV2M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What are you running from?","title":"Periculum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
