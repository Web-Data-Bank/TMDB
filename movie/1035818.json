We looked around and couldn't find a video made just for Jewish babies-so we invented one! OyBaby was released in November 2003, and we've been overwhelmed by the positive feedback we've received from parents across the country.  Growing up, our parents taught us to celebrate our Judaism, and music was always a central part of that experience. Now, as parents, we hope to do the same for our son. OyBaby will be one of the first steps in his Jewish discovery. We wish the same for the children in your life, too.  We hope you have as much fun watching it as we had making it!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8izj4sk8C4IoUa90gHxThOFrx0L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184233,"logo_path":null,"name":"OyBaby LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Oy!
