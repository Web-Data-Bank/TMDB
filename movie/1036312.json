María and Fer live an intense and complicit love, in an idyllic setting by the coast of Cádiz: a house with land, a vegetable garden with chickens, a rich social life, and time to spend with each other. Since money does matter in life, all this is sustained by exposing their sex life on OnlyFans, a social network with paid memberships, a thing they carry with ease and grace. What really lies behind all this, along with its consequences, is what we will see in these 21 moments of intimacy: the emotional flipside of OnlyFans brought by the cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Yv44RbeTPxTldbs5YgSo6JMacv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"21 Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
