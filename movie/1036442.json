Among the periods and places mentioned are the English opium trade in China, drugs in the renaissance, and in ancient Rome. Many of the addicts in Belgium come from middle-class families or better and it is implied that they turned to drugs out of a sense of alienation or because they had nothing better to do. Drug users tended to start with casual substances but quickly turn to the more seriously addictive heroin or cocaine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ielYcfaLCYuVl7zDLCVQvwiaxVy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les territoires de la défonce","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
