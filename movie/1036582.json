These 40 seconds of film are possibly the only surviving audiovisual document of an event that persists as a foggy memory in the conscience of most Puerto Ricans.  Rain with Snow is a double projection that tries to visualize the ideological production processes behind these images, zooming in, stretching out and manipulating the last cinematic vestige of this moment. Through editing, intentions are subverted and new meanings are uncovered which were repressed in the construction process that trivialized this event to turn it into easily digestible information.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Aim0yUtL3Sy5T34jPuCj0LyM1tX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2014-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain with Snow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
