The film is based on Rogaland's cultural and industrial landscape, but as the title Nowhere suggests, the images are not tied to a specific place. The film sheds light on the contrast between man and nature, and on man's urge to shape his surroundings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Qlf1KWFzNKTpsvOE0jqKMPOHnx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nowhere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
