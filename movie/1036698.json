But the unfinished Dokhunda was banned by the Soviet authorities when film production was already in full swing. No footage survived. This is why Izvolov had to rely on Lev Kuleshov’s draft to study and appreciate the maestro’s vision and the unique aesthetic concept, which was never to be realised during Kuleshov’s lifetime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dRLxOUJp0mrkzBr2ovI1vH99Ay6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dokhunda","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
