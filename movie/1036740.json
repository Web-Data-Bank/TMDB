As the new government began to crush  basic human rights, Maestro Shajarian risked everything to confront the regime, singing truth to power and uniting the country in a chorus of millions strong. His life long pursuit of equality through art is immortalized for generations to come, through his majestic, soaring vocals and lyrics. His internationally renowned hymn, “MORGHE SAHAR”, performed at the finale of all his concerts  is widely considered the Unofficial National Anthem for Iranian Freedom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9vylAKKdUE8zJRJI4NPIa1IsaIZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matilda Production Services","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Voice of Dust and Ash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
