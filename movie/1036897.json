The Head of the Organization (HOO), is as powerful as the Pope. The HOO must be a male member of the Yarborough family. After the death of the latest HOO, Michael (who should've been the successor but was disqualified due to his sister, Judy, revealing to the organization his indiscretions as a teenager) is determined to have his child, Tahir, installed before Judy and the selection committee finds out that Tahir is a trans woman. But only men can occupy the elite position. Judy is determined to block Tahir from the position as she did his father 25 years ago. Michael and Judy's fighting uncover family secrets and crimes that should never be brought to the light of day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x3FH0QY1f2FyvcDVTv4DxGlaysw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Yarborough's Way","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
