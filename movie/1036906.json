The loving father has invited a royal family whom he has not seen before for the prospect of marrying off his dark-skinned daughter. His stay-at-home brother-in-law has posted a YouTube video inviting anyone who wants to buy their special-breed black chicken. The royal family is expected in the morning but they delay their arrival to show-off, and the chicken buyers show up in the morning to crack the deal early. Confusion becomes an understatement when the chicken buyers are assumed to be the groom and afterwards the royal family as cheap bird lovers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pZRDcwjGhXsCD2pWrMBwglyfIl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kadaknath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
