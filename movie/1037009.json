The film unveils and deconstructs the ways we try to store and optimize memory, through monuments, photographs, legal depositions, high security data centers, and notions of heaven itself, making for a critical reflection of the Cloud in all its forms. Addressed as a letter to a long-lost friend, Cloud Gate 2 reverse-engineers the physical and spiritual structures of memory––the unending loop between seeing, remembering, and knowing––and the function of images within this cycle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bf5YWeB4ocv5QI9gJUeTEAWNBsR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cloud Gate 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
