A variety of hazy, lo fi clips rub up against an isolated digerati immersed in temporary pornutopias. Why not name it a small collection, a modest archive of sexual imageries and pleasures? The relationship between monopoly capitalism and sexual imaging is laid bare, along with the production of a gendered subject, the question of post-pornography and its new identity formations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Watch Pornography","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
