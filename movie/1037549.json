People locked in their homes. Terrified. We follow a girl during her everyday life. She goes out alone or sits at home doing...nothing. We hear her thoughts, her concerns. A species of people that had disappeared makes its reappearance. They are called \"passers-by\" and they scare her. In fact, she meets one of them during a walk. He doesn't see her. People have stopped feeling because they should but she hasn't made it and still feels. He feels an overwhelming need to speak to this passer-by, the stream boy. He doesn't. Instead, she takes us through a labyrinth of reflections and shows us her own perspective on this new everyday life.\r The film was made in the context of the 5th Panorama Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with the theme DEACTIVATION.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fXNfcik1QgAsKDJeaUoA39ffI1n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178672,"logo_path":"/8joqZUDTpKoP3fNlUgIULcCZueX.png","name":"Panorama Film School of A.U.Th.","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The passers-by","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
