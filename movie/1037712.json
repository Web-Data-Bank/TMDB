We see their hopes for a freer life and feel their fears as the authorities crack down. Pulse-racing scenes bring the viewer to street level, where peaceful protest is met with fury and tear gas.  Clear-eyed about the complications and contradictions that come with a movement that changed Hong Kong forever, Hong Kong: City on Fire is a brave document of troubled times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eSG3VAZjCSupJXO4J9UTJZmRw4m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enemy Films","origin_country":""},{"id":101701,"logo_path":"/uqlHSPjt2wdmDDwqd9l4jTdG779.png","name":"Dartmouth Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hong Kong: City on Fire","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
