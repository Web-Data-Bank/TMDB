Llangollen sits alongside the River Dee in Denbighshire and is a popular tourist attraction, not least for its steam railway and awe-inspiring aqueduct.  In this film we’ll be travelling back in time to visit the exhibition, enjoy the scenery, see the props and monsters, visit the DAPOL factory and hear the stories of those who worked there … and those who have happy memories of visiting one of the biggest Doctor Who exhibitions ever mounted!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r7ywRNv6HKQ1XjymqL6mwtXSrtZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor on Display: Llangollen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
