For 75 years Max Wolff has captured pre and post war Jewish life on film as a way to cope with his own trauma. Captured chronicles Batya's reviewing the image archive, hoping the nearly 100,000 photographs can help her process the past and provide a new clarity in the lives of her and her two sisters.
