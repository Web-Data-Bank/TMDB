When the revolution comes to a head, and President Yanukovych absconds, his magnificent estate is left behind. Mustafa, Svitlana and Serhiy go inside – and see the extent of the corruption and greed in its rooms. Now they want to go one step further and completely change politics. They run for parliament themselves in 2014 – and win. But the 2019 election changes everything. While Serhiy supports the candidate Selenskyj, Mustafa and Svitlana take a different path. Serhiy must now fight for himself alone.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Generation Euromaidan","title":"Beyond Revolution – Fighting for Democracy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
