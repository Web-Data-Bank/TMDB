It is the one returned by his mini camera, which attends the funeral ceremonies that marked the departure of Ousmane Sembene in Dakar, and finds the relatives of Sembene in the house he had built in Yoff, directly on rocks beaten by the ocean. These simple and close images, with a distance from the ceremonial that Sembene would have appreciated, those briefly borrowed from his films and archives, weave a film full of friendship and fraternity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wqaT9Xnd1mKoJmtx3OwLZEqZ83n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Sembene!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
