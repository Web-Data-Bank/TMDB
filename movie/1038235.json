Tied together by the remarkable performances of actress Nahana, who embodies the various female characters across the film’s differing narratives, Nakamura’s episodic feature delves into the lives of women in COVID-era Japan, finding profundity and human connection amid the unlikely encounters of strangers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nkRuCn0XyxK1iZVpAga4LWd7ZqP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Omphalos Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She is me, I am her","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
