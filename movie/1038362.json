Australian actor, Cate Blanchett, performs the manifestos as a series of striking monologues.  The installation draws on the writings of Futurists, Dadaists, Fluxus artists, Situtationists and Dogma 95, and the musings of individual artists, architects, dancers and filmmakers. Passing the philosophies of Claes Oldenburg, Yvonne Rainer, Kazimir Malevich, André Breton, Elaine Sturtevant, Sol LeWitt, Jim Jarmusch, and other influencers through his lens, Rosefeldt has edited and reassembled a collage of artists’ manifestos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a29LE0NqlDGHoanr0KspsaInILh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44660,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian Centre of the Moving Image","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manifesto","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
