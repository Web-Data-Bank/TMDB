Organised by The Doctor Who Appreciation Society (DWAS), Convention ’77 was ground breaking, featuring star appearances from the, then, current Doctor Tom Baker with his latest assistant Louise Jameson and former Doctor Who Jon Pertwee. Together with autograph sessions, a display of props, a visual FX lecture by Mat Irvine and talks by Terrance Dicks and producer Graham Williams, this convention set the tone for the future and led directly to the legendary DWAS PanoptiCons of the 1980s and 90s.  40 years later, stars, guests, fans and organisers returned to the church hall to reminiscence about that special day … what they expected and what they experienced. Also, to evaluate its importance … what it started … and what it led to!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eQDmEDhQRltblZERIBenxV9WPTB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Celebrating the 40th anniversary of the world’s first Doctor Who convention!","title":"Panopticon Genesis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
