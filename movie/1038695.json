Seaside Special is a genuine, funny and bittersweet documentary about the trials and tribulations of life on the stage and the divided political perspectives of their community.  The director Jens Meurer seeks to show a ‘microcosm of Brexit England’ and reflects on the impact of the changing tourist landscape, alongside the cultural importance of Cromer’s show, as they prepare for their grande summer finale.","popularity":0.625,"poster_path":"/pQCflOfoQzfOkjAkPVzqqD8Exlx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instant Film","origin_country":""},{"id":19037,"logo_path":"/tceh2aAORA5JxIZSLQ1GkzTBZDL.png","name":"uMedia","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":2254,"logo_path":"/4OQ25tiNECBBRDUhfC5ACa1vOIR.png","name":"Egoli Tossell Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seaside Special","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
