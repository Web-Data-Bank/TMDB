The images so formed are put into short series, so that the order given to the variations result in more or less continuous movement. It is a re-translation of the manipulation during the photocopying process into cinematographic movement. The animation results in vibrations and distortions of the graphic screen, it warps the two-dimensional surface into quixotic impressions of space and at times completely dissolves the strict geometry into flowing lines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/72GfXA9Ke4XXF3B6ERn7lL5SvFQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let it flicker, baby.
