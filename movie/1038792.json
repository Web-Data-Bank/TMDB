Ветер с юга","overview":"The annual opium production in Afghanistan is equal to 150 billion single doses! This is 25 times more than the population of the globe. At the same time, even if all heroin production in Afghanistan is destroyed now, the current situation is that its reserves will last for future generations for at least another 100 years! At the same time, according to the UN, more than 100 thousand people die from Afghan heroin every year in the world. And every third of them is a Russian! There was no similar situation in the recent (relative to 2010) 2001: there were practically no poppy fields and drug laboratories in Afghanistan. But after the start of the anti-terrorist operation \"Indestructible Freedom\" (directed against the ruling Afghan Taliban regime and the terrorist organization \"Al-Qaeda\") and after the introduction of US and NATO military contingents into Afghanistan, the production of opiates has increased 44 times in 9 years here!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74087,"logo_path":null,"name":"VSTRECHA Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2010-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heroin.
