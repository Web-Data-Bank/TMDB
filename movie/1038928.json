Theo Angelopoulos and Nikos Panayotopoulos had been chosen by the editorial board for the first issue. A summer evening at Angelopoulos house in the Mati area, Antonis Kokkinos and Yannis Soldatos recorded a three-hour interview between Theo and Nikos, within the frameworks set for them, in order to be included in the magazine. The interview brought to the fore their common course, even though completely opposite from one point onward. Thirty-five years later, the unpublished conversation has been found; both the tapes and the transcripts! This conversation stands as a valuable manifestation of the creators’ views regarding their own, until then, existing and future work, as well as a thorough insight into the New Greek Cinema, and into World Cinema in general.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/gUsSUqeIjywd9jhn3PhgIeEx97z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Each Their Voice: Theo Angelopoulos & Nikos Panayotopoulos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
