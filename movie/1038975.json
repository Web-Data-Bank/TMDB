The long-term youth pastor from Jena doesn’t fit into any system. In the GDR he was under state surveillance, after reunification he was one of the most tireless warning voices against the growing right-wing radicalism. To this day, he takes to the barricades against the extreme right, often on the frontline. Nevertheless, this film portrait by his son Tilman is not an homage but a critical tribute to an outspoken character forced by retirement to re-invent himself.","popularity":0.958,"poster_path":"/m6Dsmz9EtymPTQIO76fTpvkAuwM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172897,"logo_path":null,"name":"2Könige Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neue Bioskop Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pastor Lothar Stops","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
