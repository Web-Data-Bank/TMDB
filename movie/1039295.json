Nothing ever seems to work out the way Wade hopes it will. At least she has a job (calling out Bingo numbers), a loving family (although her father's new wife is just a few years older than Wade), and a social life (if answering an emergency hotline on a Saturday night counts). So what if her sister gets all of the dates and her father is finally getting the son he always wanted? Wade is armed with her camcorder, and the result is a honest and painfully humorous video diary that captures a changing American family in the 1990s. - From IMDB","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grist for the Mill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
