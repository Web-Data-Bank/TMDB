The audio for Summer Shall Not Fade has been mixed in both 5.1 and stereo by Big Big Train’s resident sound engineer, Rob Aubrey.  The thirteen song set runs to over two hours. It includes classic material from English Electric, Folklore and Grimspound studio albums, and fan favourite deep cuts Kingmaker and Summer’s Lease. The performance features the full Big Big Train live band, including the late David Longdon, plus a five-piece brass section and is made even more remarkable by the fact that it was only the band’s eighth live show in this incarnation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kLMyhlBxpCPNT7Wy1rWawLfjnBv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Big Train: Summer Shall Not Fade (Live at Loreley)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
