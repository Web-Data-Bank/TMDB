A wonderful Bay Area tale, the film traces the path of a 1927 grand piano owned by a music teacher who bequeathed her treasure to her alma mater, UC Berkeley, with the stipulation that the university ultimately reward it to \"a worthy student of piano.\" Before it can be given away, however, it must be restored, and here the essence of the story unfolds, as Korty follows the piano's rebirth under the masterful care of Oakland's venerable Callahan Piano Service. - from IMDB","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miracle in a Box: A Piano Reborn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
