After the honeymoon, Ed takes his bride to the home that had been his mother's, and Peggy redecorates the entire house in her husband's absence. Gradually, Ed learns to submit to his wife's modern attitudes until he discovers that her continual visits to the city have not been to the dentist's, as she had said, but to the studio of portrait painter Perry Pipp. Ed angrily confronts Peggy with her deception, forcing her to return home to her parent's house. Later, when Ed learns that Peggy has been posing for a portrait as a birthday surprise, he begs his wife's forgiveness, which she bestows, along with the information that a baby is on it's way. - From IMDb","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Persuasive Peggy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
