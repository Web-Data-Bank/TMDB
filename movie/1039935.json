Humiliated, Phyllis makes a wager that she will lead Warren to the altar within the month. To gain his attention, she faints on his doorstep and then realizes that he is not at home. Peering through the window, Phyllis spies a woman stealing the silver, whereupon she enters the house and forces Mollie, the burglar, to exchange clothing with her. When Warren arrives, Phyllis feigns a guilty look and explains that her father and brother force her to steal. Hoping to reform the attractive \"crook,\" Warren offers her a position as his maid and soon falls in love with her. Later the crooks again try to rob him, and after Phyllis helps him to foil their plan, he proposes. Upon learning her true identity, Warren is greatly offended, but Phyllis easily convinces him that her love is genuine. - from IMDB","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Social Quicksands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
