Those who ride the Midwest will tell you - they donâ€™t need endless storm cycles, 4,000 feet of vert or fancy base areas to have fun. A few rope tows and rails, a set of slalom gates to bash, reliable snowmaking and a sense of adventure is all it takes. The ski industry could learn a few tricks from these tried and true Midwest ski areas: Family-first means affordable passes, after school programs, volunteer-led race clubs and most importantly, a sense of camaraderie.  In Pursuit of Soul 2: Midwest Independence was filmed on location at Buck Hill, Caberfae Peaks, Granite Peak, Little Switzerland, Lutsen Mountains, Nordic Mountain, The Rock Snowpark, and Tyrol Basin.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/sBW6LsWH0GHFXXUs63TijtYROGF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11117,"logo_path":"/vkZJsXBKKfHZVLMDxuMktZXNmyA.png","name":"Teton Gravity Research","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"I SKI 300 VERT!","title":"In Pursuit Of Soul 2: Midwest Independence","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
