This is a hard-driving, nonstop muscial event, full of irresistibly sharp funk and scorching guitar, with the charisma of Lenny himself always front and center. Never easily categorized, Lenny was busy defying record-label pressures and carrying on the styles in \"black rock\" established by Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton, Prince, and others.  The new album was the now famous \"Circles\" — with intense and extended grooves developed here from that album's beloved songs, the title track and \"Can't Get You Off My Mind\" among them. Other early hits include \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\" and \"Are You Gonna Go My Way.\"  But the most exciting thing is the command Lenny shows of his big sound, and his own way of making music. Here is Lenny Kravitz, coming into his own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k8QP3PUiGvQXUzSSBxSHMhxcKpt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stone River Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":184934,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Media","origin_country":""},{"id":49252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema One","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lenny Kravitz: One Night in Tokyo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
