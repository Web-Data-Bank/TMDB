Billionaires… combines 16mm and 35mm found footage, hand-woven elements and DIY frame-by-frame scanning using a Lego-modded lightbox. The film is “inspired” by the hideous spectacle of the richest men in the world pretending to be astronauts. It takes a fuck-ton of hubris to strut around like latter day space “pioneers” while the world burns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vCpEXaTJDCvg1KDeB5bOR2VvLjm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billionaires Gnaw Their Tongues from the Pain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
