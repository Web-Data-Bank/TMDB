And, more prosaically, Marina, the film’s young protagonist, is faced with similar anxiety. In fact, her problem is her face. One morning, she discovers her face has changed, and she can no longer recognise herself. Not even her mother can, who bumps into her on the street and says hello to her like she would to any stranger (deadpan, surreal humor is part of the film’s recipe). Marina is thus forced to confront her identity: who is she? Is she determined by her parent’s DNA or by her ID card? Can she be identified by a family portrait, by biometrics or the love of those around her, including her Colombian boyfriend? Is she prettier now?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ouG3UQ5BR5goq7xQViwlIlRYtbH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110614,"logo_path":"/riAFxERom05fmY00YX1ARKx9wXM.png","name":"Gentil","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":91450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zona Audiovisual","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2022-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Face of the Jellyfish","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1}
