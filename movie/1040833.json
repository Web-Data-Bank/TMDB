The B-52's close the show with a powerful, danceable \"Party Out Of Bounds,\" complete with edgy horns, percussion, keyboards, and yelling. This is an unforgettable evening of irresistible post-punk rock and roll.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/blD7wdmSjvQAgTCX5o8jU1sgLjG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio One","origin_country":""},{"id":38373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinevu Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The B-52's: Live: Germany 1983","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
