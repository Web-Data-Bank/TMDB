Showing up with no invitation, the self-styled ladies’ man will not rest until he has won her affections. She's running out of ways to convey her feelings. He won't take a hint. What can Ada do to get rid of him? What sordid ideas could Otto get once his pride has been wounded? A film palindrome of comic proportions, Wine and Roses (and Wine) explores the dilemmas modern women face when confronting the entitled presumptions of men who won’t take “no” for an answer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3sVnXEV1arsTEsl5D9zVZQA5KCS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185039,"logo_path":"/14t31BjNJ3zhLs6PlTtQyweXa7a.png","name":"Glasgow Film Crew","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A polite girl struggles to send away from her home an uninvited guest with romantic intentions.","title":"Wine and Roses (and Wine)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
