He finds her but loses her again. How long do we grieve a loved one? How long do we hear their voice echoing after they have gone?  In 1607, Claudio Monteverdi created his Orfeo, for the Carnival opening at the Court Theatre of Duke Vincenzo I in Mantua. Billed as a ‘musical fable’, here was a new form where characters are brought to life with poignant human feelings. Orfeo’s dramatic power gave birth to what we call opera today. As in the original performance in an intimate space in Mantua, Garsington’s summer 2022 production sees the singers and musicians very close; the instrumentalists are part of the action, onstage and visible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7lTUKtFWZ3PcVtTvejW3kXQZqes.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orfeo - Garsington","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
