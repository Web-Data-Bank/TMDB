For Michael Jordan, the year ahead will be a very strange one. Once a player who could seemingly deliver championships through sheer force of will, the owner of the Charlotte Bobcats is finally developing the one skill he had always denied himself: patience. Nothing about that is easy, and nothing about the lovable, unforgettable 2011-2012 Bobcats will be easy. But as much as he despises losing, Mike has always seemed to love the struggle.","popularity":2.006,"poster_path":"/puWHu1l1QMQgTKI39wTecLSoVTN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118672,"logo_path":null,"name":"SB Nation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The People You're Paying to Be in Shorts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
