By explaining the cause of infectious diseases, the scientist also understood what the antidote to them should be: vaccination. Such was its success that this technique for stimulating the immune system has since become the standard-bearer of scientific medicine, to the point of drawing a dividing line between light and obscurantism, science and superstition. Nevertheless, vaccination cannot be exempt from all questioning. Does it act on the organism beyond protection against a disease? Do we know that the order in which vaccines are administered influences their effectiveness and their possible harmfulness? Should everyone be vaccinated? Do laboratories exploit fear?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/px3nyxWty9V5zIg0YGneg4RV9te.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Vaccines and Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
