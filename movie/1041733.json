Muskotti, her mother, has such a bad memory that she doesn't know how old Mimosa is. Mimosa's birthday is a warm and fairytale-like film, but at the same time a sneaky story about a girl's growth into adulthood. It takes place entirely in a wizarding world awash with a night blue glow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8sNhUWyuTpHGElNumDhDprflvHX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1987-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mimosa's Birthnight","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
