In 1988, club legend Leigh Bowery installs himself behind a one-way mirror in a week-long residency at Anthony d'Offay Gallery in London. Each day he presents a look from his shocking repertoire, appropriating and revising styles and cultures. Jewell places his camera on the street to capture visitors exiting the gallery, inviting them to react to the show, in the moment. The range of interviewees is diverse, from students and gallery staff, to the cognoscenti from the worlds of art, clubs and fashion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8kLKk0oze90roHVq7EBe9kKbuoe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's Your Reaction to the Show?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
