Set mostly in a university library, this political debate between a medical student, his 1770s ancestor, and a history professor is a sequel to the 1972 National Education Program film, Brink of Disaster! Two additional characters appear in this drama: a 19th-century steamboat captain, and the studentâ€™s grandfather - an early 20th-century automobile worker. The National Education Program at Harding College in Searcy, Arkansas created a variety of widely-distributed anti-communism films from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/DFnZBm2AHZKeTn3GEl0Gn3VyFp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jerry Fairbanks Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Educating 1960s campus protesters as to \"what's right with America.\"","title":"Tragedy or Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
