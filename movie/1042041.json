And all for only one reason â€“ God! They embrace a rhythm of life rooted in prayer (Lectio Divina) and work in their state-of-the-art candy factory. All of it is steeped in a deep, contemplative tradition of silence and solitude. Life inside their cloistered monastery is all about preferring nothing but Jesus Christ. They live in what the Sisters call a school of mutual love, trying to find Christ in every moment of every day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dFUTunOvY7IA1XV7uACDaEaiy3Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hidden: A Life All for God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
