Ma Nan bought a property in the suburbs, just in time for Xiaoyu's birthday. So he called his colleagues and friends and the party was held in a cheerful atmosphere. Next door to Ma Nan's house lived a couple who often quarreled. The unusually loud noise aroused the curiosity of party-goers. They went next door together to find out, but unexpectedly found a terrifying and bloody murder scene. The apartment, which was originally sparsely populated, seems to have turned into a huge haunted house. Flickering lights, shrill screams, and maddened murders. A plague-like virus spreads freely in the apartment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dMMzcNmd6chcqbLoMkg8uWHtgXI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2270,"logo_path":null,"name":"China Film Group Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2012-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Run","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
