Then I superimposed the videos and exported the full project in 480p 400 kbps. The song is withoutu by SALEM. Obviously inspired by Stan Brakhage, got the inspiration to finish the project by watching the work of Audrey Robinovitz. Hope you get something out of this like I did :3","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5t5Z9jWlYquK8uMVcw6hPvCZyu9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"withoutu.mp4","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
