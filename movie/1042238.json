One night you are woken up by a loud bang. You think nothing to it, turn over and go back to sleep. But in the morning, your school is cordoned off, with police officers and a professor from the Science Museum on site. A spaceship has landed in the playground! And when its door begins to open, nobody knows quite what to expect…  In 1988 the children at Newlyn Place First School in Fishermead didn’t have to imagine, because it happened in their playground. The alien who emerged from the spaceship was named Zerena – she was friendly but lost and far from home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Educating Zerena: An Alien Encounter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
