The VIT is a new trail, and Nick and Becca are among the first hikers to attempt to hike the route in one six-week trip.  The story of Nick's experience with diabetes throughout his life is interwoven with the challenges of managing it in a backcountry environment, bringing information and insight about a chronic health condition that is reasonably common yet misunderstood by many people.  The mountains, forests, and coastlines of Vancouver Island are brought to life by original art, animation, and photography by the filmmakers, both of whom are multidisciplinary visual artists. Peaks and Valleys will appeal to lovers of nature, adventure, art, and disability justice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eMugZ5XyKzG5DpTpeJIpcq1Nu0y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peaks and Valleys: Type 1 Diabetes on the Vancouver Island Trail","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
