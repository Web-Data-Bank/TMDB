More than that, the short film plunges into the daily life of a couple to tell the story behind the non-history of a body full of silences: she is a transvestite; he is a cis: there is a concrete wall between them where it is impossible to see beyond. And this Thing that separates the bodies; this Thing for which the character asks help - for this there is no name.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dS2HsuYh58lsOe07BXTOXAbnsF3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosa Neon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
