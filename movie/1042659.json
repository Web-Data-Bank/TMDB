The father – a foolish, hotshot financier – collects miniature dioramas of historical atrocities as a hobby. Mother is a has-been prima donna fighting against the vagaries of age and fame. Inheriting their privilege and casual cruelty is daughter Amy, a rebellious if somewhat insular teenager longing to break out of her gilded cage. To gain a semblance of control over her cocooned existence, Amy produces an autobiographical mock-Kabuki performance that parodies her family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/igIXp3IGoNl8LuJyekH7mdsvzNb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34602,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Productie","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If Yes, Okay","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
