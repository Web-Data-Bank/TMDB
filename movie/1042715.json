How is a word embodied? How do we establish a listening ear? These are all questions at the heart of so called politics. And just as decisive, who is talking to whom?

Here are the bodies of some – you, me, everyone, in short the ultimate political body in a democracy – who endorse, are taken by the game and sometimes the words already spoken by others – well-known candidates. From one word to another, through the gaps that this authorises as much as the unforeseen associations, the exposure is as enjoyable as it is disconcerting.
