He films them. This is the starting point for a film that, without the camera ever leaving its unique position behind the window, progressively opens up the circle of perceptions and emotions to the dimensions of the world. The space makes this cosmological miracle possible : a bus stop, a riverbank and the river that runs along it, but also the filmmaker’s appartment, where daily life and its sounds resonate : a multiple scene upon which pass time, seasons, beings of all ages and conditions. This film is its author’s last, as he died just after having finished the editing. It is life itself, made poetry.
