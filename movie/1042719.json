Following up on Saturn and beyond (Georges de Beauregard International Award, FID 2021), Declan Clarke listens in again. The waves here, are those that, through the figure of the writer Francis Stuart, connected the Irish nationalist movement to Nazi Germany : anti-English broadcasts for German radio from 1940 to 1944, pirate radio transmitter sent from Germany to Ireland, infiltration of German agents helped by the author’s wife who stayed in Ireland… The director plays the writer’s role but we never hear his voice, as if to offset the power of radio as a means of propagating a discourse. Both rigorous and playful, vivid and melancholic, this film is a meditation on political compromission and the mass media that serve as their tools.(Nathan Letoré)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What are the Wild Waves Saying?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
