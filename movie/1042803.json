The MEMORY SERIES compresses 10 years of Video8 footage in 10 MEGABYTES, 1 MEGABYTE and 1000 BITS OF MEMORY. The algorithm is working, memory is fading, images are becoming more and more abstract. Compression relates to an aesthetic of the small file format, a counter strategy against the ever increasing resolution, bitrate and (environmental) cost of digital images.
