Inspired by Donna Haraway the film is about a future of response-ability to inhabit the n-dimensional niche space called Earth or Terrapolis. We look for “real stories that are also speculative fabulations and speculative realisms. (…) stories in which multispecies players, who are enmeshed in partial and flawed translations across difference, redo ways of living and dying attuned to still possible finite flourishing, still possible recuperation.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postcards for the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
