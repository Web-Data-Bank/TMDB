One very cold winter afternoon, the two of them cross the border into Spain with their friends in search of some ancient Roman baths. At nightfall, when there is no trace of our contemporary world, António dares to tell Jota he is afraid that soon they will no longer be friends and that he will be alone. It is then that we discover there are other boys bathing, they are the Roman soldiers who built the baths 2000 years before. Aurelius (19 years old), Pompey (21 years old) and their colleagues are all celebrating their last night before leaving for the war front in Dacia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Night I Conquered the City of Thebes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
