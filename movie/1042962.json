The only probably is she feels she is always being watched. Vondrick is a stunning vampire from the 16th century, who has lost everyone he ever held so dear. Gustavus is Vondrick's blood brother in a sense, who is always trying to look out for Vondrick until he fell in love with a mortal. It goes like this, \"Vampires are not allowed to fall in love with mortals... if they do it would mean ruin for the mortal and a broken heart for the vampire.\" On one dark night, Aurelius's feeling of \"stalked\" becomes reality and on top of that, due to her sudden sleep disorder her nightmares are getting worst. Aurelius is no longer her ol' self. Now Aurelius finds herself undergoing a strange and mysterious journey into a realm darker than any mortal has ever seen... but she is not alone, as Vondrick leads her on this romantic trip into the shadows.
