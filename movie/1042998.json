We were in high school: we smoked firecrackers, we watched movies, we listened to music. We were sixteen, twenty, we were partying”. The director revisits archives of his youth. Once it seemed an accidental documentation of shared life, full of hopes and anticipation of the future. Now these grainy video images contain the whole universe, non-existing anymore. It is inhabited by shadows, including the passed away friend. Eternity is found in cinema, in which time is regained, according to Léo Liotard.","popularity":0.704,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Party Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
