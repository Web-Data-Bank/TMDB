Seeing this as a perfect image for the death of a certain Lisbon in the wake of the financial crisis and the ensuing real estate and touristic boom, the director films an urban diary portraying the daily life of the construction site and those who work there. What starts out as a work-centred film turns out to be the story of the directorâ€™s relationship with his hometown and with the people who build it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of a City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
