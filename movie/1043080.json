Decried by the Council as an eyesore, but hailed by Historic England as an exemplar of postwar design, the story of John Madin's concrete colossus and the fight to save it is a curious one. In this psychogeographic detective story, Howlett weaves together archive footage with on-the-ground explorations in an attempt to figure out why we lost Paradise and how it might be regained.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bMmvD5pP3SuxUhy7NBX1TFURoFW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One building stood as a testament to the promise of Paradise.","title":"Paradise Lost: History in the Un-Making","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
