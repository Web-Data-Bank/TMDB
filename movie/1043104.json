They observed me from everywhere. In parallel to the production of the film, we set out to capture the feeling of totalitarianism that these portraits conveyed. We got up at 4 in the morning and shot through the window of a car because such actions put us under threat of persecution. We understood that we were documenting the time of the birth of fascism in Russia.” Vladlena Sandu","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5UqEts28hNaf692K8J87gbc0WJR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Nation Without Culture","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
