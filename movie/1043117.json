The animation was shot in the genre of political satire.  The visual solution of the tape proposed by the artist Henrikh Umanskyi is reminiscent of the films of the German expressionist cinema of the 1920s, in particular the legendary film \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920). There, too, the main character was a mad scientist, and the events unfolded in distorted scenery that emphasized the state of insanity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cWP7SwGGhx6tsVp1dWi7RV4zNxq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19997,"logo_path":"/n1XHZgKeOC4GAGcLMAqQSr9Cchz.png","name":"Kyivnaukfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mars XX","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
