Ever the rebel, Nancy challenged familial and societal norms. At various points of her life, she was married to a Christian, an Orthodox Jew and finally, a Palestinian. As a single mother, Nancy became a leading figure in the Israeli equestrian world, but a chance encounter with horse-loving Palestinians prompted her to establish the first Palestinian equestrian team. Professionally and personally, Zeitlin continues to bridge religious and cultural divisions in Israeli society, through a love of horses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UnReined","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
