By using animation, we are able to show a unique perspective and tell the story of the mother cow in a way that cannot be done from investigative footage alone. Milk centres the cow as the protagonist of her own story and allows us to view what is happening to her from an up close and personal perspective.  Organic, free-range, high-welfare, humanely raised. It doesnâ€™t matter what label we put on dairy products, all dairy cows are victims of an industry that forcibly impregnates them, takes their babies from them, exploits their bodies and then sends them to a slaughterhouse to cut their throats. It's time to end the dairy industry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7lyny7jBZ1CvEqD1mYHJgGtVC4v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"if the colour of milk reflected the reality of the dairy industry, it would run red, not white.","title":"Milk","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
