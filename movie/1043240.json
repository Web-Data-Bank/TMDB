There is a strong sense of community among the organisations that are active in the area. Not only do members gather on the days of the events, but they regularly share their passion and are quick to offer a helping hand. Viewing experiences consist of more than just the featured film or video. There are parts of it that can’t be quantified, so I hurried to make note of them before they faded from memory.” Sasaki Yusuke","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kq3Nq89YqoHtrCcm8qwJXyxXEzU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinephilia Now: Part III – Lux Crawler I++","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
