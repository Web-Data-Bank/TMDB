First things on his mind? Get the pool cleaned and install a security system. When Tony Banderas (Antonio's younger brother? A guy can dream, can't he?) shows up for a job, Dante warns \"There's more to this job than cleaning the pool.\" Tony acts dumb, but it isn't long before the two are stretched out with swimming trunks in a pile. While the plot is thin as cellophane, and you may never quite figure out what the \"scandal\" is, the sexy scene of the fix-it man watching Dante jack himself off from behind the trees is hot enough to make it all worthwhile.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d041kuaAWl3Xdl1YOFhxUmT5NnM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6711,"logo_path":"/2xujBIMy4wdsGHuwbD4qrzaIBSh.png","name":"Jet Set Men","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dante's Sex Scandal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
