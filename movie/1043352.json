In the 1990s, scores of families from the Republic of Moldova began a ritualised mail exchange between the mothers, who had emigrated for economic reasons, and their relatives back home. The former sent money and goods; the latter sent videotapes. These amateur recordings are the material of this film. They testify to the painful gaps the absent persons left in the lives of those who stayed behind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vERyQbND4MclRPKbo21uNxYTYrW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clin d'oeil Films","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"MD","name":"Moldova"}],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Is Not an Orange","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
