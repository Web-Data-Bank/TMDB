This is far from snug: the embittered mother puts her passion for vases above the love of her son and is very reproachful. This has made Harold believe he depends on her and is unable to make autonomous decisions. But then he hears another sound coming through the wall: the neighbors' rebellious, recalcitrant adolescent son. In the reticent Harold, this awakens a desire to express himself too. Shortly after, his mother dies.
