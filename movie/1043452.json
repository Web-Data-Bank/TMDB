But it doesn't have to be. The main tool of expression here is the film’s edit, which places various shots, statements, and meanings next to each other, often in a sort of productive conflict. Just like in a poem, the “poetic function” of art and its ability to serve as the primary tool for expressing beauty is manifested in full force before our very eyes.","popularity":0.701,"poster_path":"/8o9I9GrlrATpOKHGqHNsFyOA1k2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118612,"logo_path":null,"name":"Větrné mlýny","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":92588,"logo_path":null,"name":"MPhilms","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bandits of the Ballad","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
