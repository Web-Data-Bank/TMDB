But she also managed to sneak lessons on how to pursue educational goals with creative obstinacy into popular science films. Thus her educational piece about two boys who discover that magic, too, requires hard work, despite its rational approach, is far from disenchanting: The protagonists reach their conclusion via detours that take them through mysterious corridors, furtive looks through keyholes and bewitching dreams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82113,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEFA-Studio für populärwissenschaftliche Filme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1957-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hocus-Pocus Fidibus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
