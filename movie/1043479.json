Somewhat pushy, he seeks out women at the hairdresser’s and in the maternity wear department, joins functionaries in their cars, crashes wedding parties and sneaks into museum tours for children. A revelatory curiosity full of the casually captured mundane drabness that was often revealed more clearly in student films than in comparable DEFA productions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women in Neuruppin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
