He is an officer in the National People’s Army, still young, but with a lot of postings under his belt, always accompanied by his wife. She has resigned herself to her fate, while he flourishes enviably in his profession. Róża Berger-Fiedler spends most of the time by his side, following him in brisk cuts from appointment to appointment. Talking is required and demanded constantly: to representatives of the Soviet armed forces, young recruits, subordinates. Words come easy to him, but not everything runs smoothly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dialogue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
