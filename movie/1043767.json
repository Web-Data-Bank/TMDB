With over 100 hits under his belt by the time this stellar concert was captured, the godfather is in rare form as he rips through this blistering set. The band is on fire - rhythmically impeccable while dishing out smoking R&B as convincingly as they wrap their soul around a rousing ballad. Brown and the boys strut their trademark snappy call and response routine which these players know better than to miss cue on!  What do you do for an encore?  Jam, brother, jam! Give the cats some more room to shine and you're treated to some of the hottest solos this side of the Mason Dixon line. Take a chance, transport yourself back to this sizzling event and experience one of the best gigs ever recorded from the comfort of your living room.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zdmR8FXLMNqqc5asdUNJcoFD7Ax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Dog Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Brown: Live","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
