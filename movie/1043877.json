Janie Caswell, who is fully in control in the boardroom is a complete wreck at the thought of becoming a mom. She is afraid she will get it all wrong--or worse, get it right, then suffer the same illness that took her mom away from her early in life. Through an answer to prayer and the help of a New York cabbie/angel, Janie gets a chance to see what her life could be in the future. Janie realizes that the baby years go by fast, and childhood is too precious a time to waste. Janie is miraculously offered the chance of a \"do-over\" and relishes every moment of being a wife and new mom.","popularity":0.669,"poster_path":"/vjpodtffvICnCHoa4O0Z26zh0ov.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beautiful Feet Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":110513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canyon Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Successful, married, and very pregnant, Janie Caswell is about to have it all: career, family, success; when she is blindsided by a semi-truck and wakes up seven years in the future where \"having it all\" is not what she expected.","title":"An Unlikely Angel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
