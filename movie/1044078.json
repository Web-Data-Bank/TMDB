Together they come up with a high-profile event to capture people’s attention to the environmental catastrophe happening in their own backyards. They will put together a group of international swimmers to do something that has never been done: to swim across the Dead Sea, from Jordan to Israel.  The film follows this extraordinary and dangerous action, hoping to achieve media exposure to drive the region’s countries to act. However, the friendship between the trio is tricky, and the political realities and personal baggage that each one must deal with are explored.  The only chance for saving the Sea lies in connecting people, bridging their divisions for the greater good. The trio are willing to take the risks because they understand their steps of trust are the only way to create change. One swim at a time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hrxYIx9InIpSFjPhzzS8QTSNUXw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"THREE NATIONS IN ENDLESS CONFLICT ARE WILLING TO RISK THEIR LIVES IN ORDER TO SAVE THE DEAD SEA.","title":"Dead Sea Guardians","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
