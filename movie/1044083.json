While fleeing the impending loss of his terminally ill mother, Micah finds his way into a fire-ravaged building, which turns out to be anything but abandoned. He encounters an ancient creature residing among the wreckage, collecting and coveting the lost treasures, hopes, and dreams of children's forgotten youth, feeding off their energy. The Molok holds a secret to overcoming the painful memories that Micah has repressed - perhaps even the key to the boy's salvation. But what does The Molok want from the boy in return? The cost may be too high.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Molok","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
