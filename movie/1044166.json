This film provides a glimpse behind the walls of the barracks, where soldiers participate in the required drills and exercises, but also find ways in which to alleviate boredom. We watch young recruits during daily activities: eating, cleaning, and video conversations with the surrounding world. However, the montage also includes the vlogs of men who have already completed their military training and share their experiences, anecdotes, and frustrations over the internet. In this way, the problematic aspects of a militarized society appear in between entertaining excerpts from military life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over Our Hills","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
