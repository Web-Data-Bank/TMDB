The film largely treats the relationship with her late husband, poet Petr Kabeš, and the feeling of loneliness she has been facing since his death. It is definitely not a conventional documentary portrait, since the director does not ask questions, and instead lets Karenina voice out her thoughts and feelings, observing her with a casual camera during work or on her mountaineering trips. The film also serves as an implicit proof of love to analogue medium: not only the book, but analogue film as well, with its invisible, yet almost tangible features.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8zWmaSrcneEuLKzRiumQcLxe4I0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2023-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Found by the One She Seeks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
