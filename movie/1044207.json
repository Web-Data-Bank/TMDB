The autobiographical narrative is a composition of fragments of stories and descriptions of inner turmoil, drawing the audience into an elaborate world of sometimes illustrative, sometimes metaphorical animations and ingenious sound design to understand the causes and experience of depression, the struggle to break out of its darkness, and the feelings of futility and heaviness. Open, almost diaristically intimate notes navigate the journey through rooms, floors and different environments that embody the manifestations of inner heaviness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aRZI8jY0Z9j80UrhS0z17Nbeqcp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darkening","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
