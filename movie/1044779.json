The first name suggestion for the film was \"Hospital Mental\", whose main theme was already related to madness. The script explores insanity as the athletes act like crazy in their stories. What the film tries to convey is that crazy people are not in a static state of madness, but evolve, just as these athletes are somehow changing and evolving the sport.  After California, the next location was Hawaii, not only for the potential of the waves but also for the light for filming. Finally, several image intensives were held in Brazil, between March and October.  The film was produced completely independently and all ideas for the script, direction and images captured are by Pablo Aguiar.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wFlWLscVU3cK7XevVwylFpfzudQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
