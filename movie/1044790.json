The mix of archived footage showed that Burrow was a freak from the start. The contest footage proved the guy could grind it out with a fluorescent singlet on his back. The party scenes and women showed, well, that Burrow didn’t earn that rambunctious reputation for no reason. But the best part, in my opinion, showcased Burrow’s “psycho, mutant of wave” that he calls home. And with cameos by Mick Fanning, Jake Patterson, and Bobby Martinez, plus a soundtrack as eclectic as Burrow’s surfing, it should come as no wonder why Montaj won Surfer Poll’s “Movie of the Year” in 2002.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bLFdX9FHIctDLqf35Eb8XRVLq5I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montaj","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
