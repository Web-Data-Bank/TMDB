Following a desire to reflect on the nature of intimacy, loss and memory, he traveled to film couples and individuals from different countries, who were open to sharing the typically-private intimacies of their lives. The footage was later intercut with Lebonâ€™s own personal travel and holiday footage and reworked through successive stages of bleaching, scratching, painting, melting and cutting. Lebon commissioned an engineer to customise a number of original die-cutting machines so that specific pieces of the animated frames could be cut out and interchanged with one another. Die Cuts is the result of over three thousand hours of analogue post-production processes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pdaUMkhivplxxeW9cg7VZaj40ZI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Cuts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
