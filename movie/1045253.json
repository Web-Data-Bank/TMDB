But where do they get the girls? Between stuck-up supermodels, bashful buddies, and hot but hopefully Hollywood hopefuls, it’s getting harder to find that diamond in the rough. So when Carl, a lowly pawn shop clerk, gets a shot at making his own movie (with an actual budget) the race is on to find a legit leading lady.  Faced with a stampede of star-struck stunners, the power quickly goes to Carl’s heads (yes, both of them) and soon he begins conducting his own private auditions with the casting couch cuties (including superstars Brittany Skye and Crystal Ray). But he doesn’t stop there, widening the search to include his best friend (Diana Espen) and even the customers at his pawn shop, all the while proving that the movie business may not be easy, but it sure is fun!","popularity":0.628,"poster_path":"/3bw7IdMdChNuuWYmgdEwSvo2SmU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Full Moon Features","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Surrender Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Now casting hot girls","title":"Seduced By Fame","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
