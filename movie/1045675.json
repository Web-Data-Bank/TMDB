It examines Nathaniel Dorsky’s writings on Self-Symbols in film as applied to the exhibition and personalization of clothing. Dorsky writes: If you have ever looked at your hand and seen it freshly without concept, realized the simultaneity of its beauty, its efficiency, its detail, you are awed into appreciation. The total genius of your hand is more profound than anything you could have calculated with your intellect. One’s hand is a devotional object.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"​Self—Symbol","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
