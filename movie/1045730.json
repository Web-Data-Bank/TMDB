The footage shows children at play and Dutch windmills, but above all people engaged in heavy physical labour in the countryside and in factories. In a fascinating juxtaposition, she combines these images with excerpts from letters she received from her father just after she moved to the Netherlands in the late 1980s. Through his education in Indonesia, Tanâ€™s father knew a lot about the Netherlands without ever having visited the country. In the letters, he meanders seamlessly between personal news and world events, such as the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vxq3UpMp2GvPomrMJc61pwvdo4B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95556,"logo_path":"/gMsu30npr1bSVn7jAjJ2A2jO6S8.png","name":"EYE Film Institute Netherlands","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Footsteps","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
