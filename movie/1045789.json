Agia Paraskevi relocates to a new state of the art building after 20+ years of being in an unsuitable and ready to fall apart one. The situation got so bad that the students where literally hanging out with the chickens next to the building and as the principal of the school council told us they actually felt like they themselves where the chickens. The construction of the new building was held up since the original contractor \"ran out of money\" and thus the building was abandoned mid construction, the building stayed in this stage for more than 5 years where it was looted and vandalized. The situation had reached an impasse and so the students decided to step up and speak directly to the mayor resulting in getting heard by the secondary school administration, so years later a second contractor was hired to complete this project and finally put into operation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w3QpPiiT3e9rNKIKvVJCTX0JwFh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185729,"logo_path":null,"name":"CityFilm Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2022-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How moving changed our school","title":"Education Rebuilt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
