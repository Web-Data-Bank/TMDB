In every city one can find examples of a zealot taking a stand, wielding a sign, registering outrage to the traffic lights and passersby. Why does a man stage a 6-hour, 6+year daily protest at an abortion clinic? Who are the targets of his moral disruptions? What is wrong with people? This video is a result of a spontaneous desire to ask these question with a camera, where culture creator meets culture judge on his home turf, a strip of sidewalk on a street named after one of the city’s founders. The Ladies Accordion Gospel Team provide a spirited and spiteful respite with a performance of The March of the Pro-lifer. When the end result is rage, fear and scorn, it’s hard to know who the good guys are.
