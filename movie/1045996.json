I also play the piano and do solo singing and I go to a Russian school so I can speak French, Russian, German, Swiss-German and a little bit of English and… I think that’s all.” 8-year-old Julie dreams of becoming an actor and a singer. She works hard to achieve this. The film follows her day-to-day life and, if nothing else, raises the question of whose dreams are being pursued here – Julie’s or those of her overambitious parents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julie Wants More","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
