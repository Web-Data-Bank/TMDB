When she wakes up that morning, Ann feels that it is going to happen that day. She puts on her school uniform, but instead of going to school she is terrified of what is to come and quietly wanders the streets, hoping for human kindness and help, hoping for a miracle, while afraid to approach anyone. As a Catholic school student, she can in the end only count on the blessing of Virgin Mary and thus she gives birth to a baby boy beneath the statue of Our Lady in a grotto near the house of the congregationâ€™s priest.","popularity":1.086,"poster_path":"/AmvFzeVYvbH31uAAYfiTwQTxLen.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hill Sixteen Feature","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ann","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
