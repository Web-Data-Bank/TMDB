Inspired by the work of the Russian avant garde author Daniil Kharms, Fälle is an ode to the absurd, a tale in which logic and the principle of cause and effect are sharply mocked. In the surrealist adventures of our hero, it is not difficult to find a reflection of the inane ferocity of contemporary society, in which logic often gives way to nourish power.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bB14eUJUrKfPHtam6qleM1ohj66.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185804,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mini Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incidences","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
