Two decades ago, old filmmaker Kazem came to this remote rural village to make a documentary about the sterility of the village women. But the village women wanted to protect their dignity, so they stole and burnt the footage. By today the villagers have found out that the men are barren and there is nothing wrong with the women. With the help of his assistant, Kazem tries to record some interviews with the infertile men to unfold the truth in a new movie, but this turns out in many ways to be a Mission: Impossible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u3WjTp3CIwb1qq8bdsbv1SkxGM1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2022-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Childless Village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
