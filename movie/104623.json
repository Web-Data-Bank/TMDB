In explicit abattoir photos and much symbolism, Matsui tells about the struggles of ethnic Koreans in Japan. A butcher's love affair and his relationship with the animals he kills frame the story.","popularity":0.879,"poster_path":"/d5Fif6dFTTm9wuuB15AzppD4YWZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yokubô Production","origin_country":""},{"id":43638,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kyôeisha","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1981-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pig-Chicken Suicide","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":8}
