The nation's multiplicity imbues its population with a dynamic spirit. Yet Syria remains a patriarchal society, meaning that the daily lives of Syrian citizens are defined and dominated by men. Lina Alabad's beautiful film asks the question: What, then, is the role of women in Syria? How extensive is their access to freedom and autonomy? And what effect do the limitations imposed upon them by society have on their attitudes towards sexuality and their own bodies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t5yDfrH1o2uiuch0GReMVs4yTOQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Damascus, My First Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
