Following his father’s footsteps, his first journey leads to friends and co-workers of the participants in this unusual shooting. His second journey guides him to places where the historical and contemporary disputes, discussed in the film, took place. Here the director tries to document the development of the complex situation since Amos Kenan’s and Rashed Hussein’s discussion in New York, and find out if their bold words about peace and friendship between the two nations sharing one state became the reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imagine Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
