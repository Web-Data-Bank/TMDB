A bush pilot drops the small crew of five on a remote, unexplored glacier to conquer the spine walls in a series of ascents, each one more committed. Narrator Jérôme Tanon describes with honesty and a touch of sarcasm what exactly is going on here. Above all, he wants to feel what it’s like to be in their shoes, to understand what so called “free riders” are made of, and what could be the purpose and beauty of “freeriding”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yhA7qnlmO8Ik9JTMw5joyRNpLAl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148018,"logo_path":"/8J9VktNeFA4AWQz0K1wWoQvRMoP.png","name":"The North Face","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Rider","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
