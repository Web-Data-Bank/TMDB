Filmed in frozen backcountry of Wyoming’s most remote mountain ranges, the solitude of a lonely winter provides the perfect backdrop for an introspective examination of two of the most influential minds and careers in snowboarding’s history. Their approach is one defined by self reliance, escapism, and social distance...not by mandate, but by design.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sMi0Tevky2xgFT6Hmff0ctZcmp2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Koles","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Range Finder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
