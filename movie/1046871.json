Today, only 17 minutes of the original footage is known to survive.  Silent film historian Dr Peter Walsh and Australian film critic Tara Judah have teamed up to embark upon an early cinema/Australian cultural film odyssey to re-present the 43 minutes of absence. In so doing, they have created an hour-long video essay where myth and story meet and mingle. The final result will change what you think you know about Ned Kelly and his gang and how early cinema influenced everything from Australian national identity, the trajectory of narrative cinema, frame rates in film and even had an impact on today's range of hipster beards.  Expect original footage, documentary excerpts, clips, quips, podcast witherings and personal reflections on one of the greatest and most unknowable stories of cinema history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vUoVFYWP5SZ5YvCLiG1KdIfBWfZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mythory of the Kelly Gang","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
