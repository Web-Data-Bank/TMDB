Growing up next door to each other, the girls are as close as sisters. The two of them spend their summer detasseling corn at a local farm. Addisyn can't wait to leave their small hometown for college, while Regan has second thoughts. In between work, Addisyn is forced to manage her mother's recovery from opioid addiction while taking care of her little sister. Regan's feelings about leaving home are only made more complicated when she connects with Addisyn's attractive older brother, Ryder. As summer draws to a close, the girls must face their paths forward-for the first time--on their own.","popularity":0.887,"poster_path":"/vcWPuShE38aXrDjr8QNieMpfQcr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15181,"logo_path":"/sjQmClxWfF4NmP01QJVY8e3UVYK.png","name":"Wavelength","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You and Me This summer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
