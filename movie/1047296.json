Basile combines his Greek-French accent and puts it to good use as he takes liberties at miscommunication with the over 2,000 people who attended this crazy concert. This comedy special dealt with everything from smoking a “Fag” while in England to having Yiayia make Greek coffee to cure your every ailment. The crowd went wild for the Greek American Comedian and he returned the LOVE and added a special BONUS segment with Jimmy “Super Greek” Santis by singing of some of their hit parody songs from their CD’s of “Men In Skirts” to “Hey Yiayia”! As some have said, “it was one of the greatest concerts ever held in Canada”!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Basile goes up to the Great White North to film his third Special in wonderful Montreal Canada.
