But today's processors are a hundred times more powerful than those available in the 1970's and yet, the F-16 has been able to adapt to the new technologies as they come on stream. In fact, the F-16 is so successful that it is envisaged being in service until well into the 21st century. This programme features unique footage of F16 flight tests as well as presenting its combat record, especially during the two wars in Iraq. It finishes with a superb display sequence by a Belgian Air Force F-16.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/69ejrC7pU7DBYqyAxhF4O89SBof.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ultimate History of the F16 Fighter","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
