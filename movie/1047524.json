If they’re crying because they’re moved by his dancing as an art form, that’s fine. But if it’s out of pity because he’s in a wheelchair, they can “fuck off.” A similar attitude can be detected in Jos de Putter and Clara van Gool’s portrait of the Catalan dance collective Liant la Troca, whose members include people with a physical disability. One by one, they spotlight some of these intriguing personalities.","popularity":0.955,"poster_path":"/iC5CKKUiXRbD8Esx3IEjaSeePzu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94857,"logo_path":null,"name":"DOXY Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Way to B","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
