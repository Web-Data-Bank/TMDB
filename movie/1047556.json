Sylvana is in a wheelchair and Mohammed is blind, so she guides the way as he pushes. They talk about the constant lack of autonomy they experience in daily life, and how the obstacles they face are not only physical but above all societal. When Sylvana was a child, other children were forbidden to play with her for fear that her disability was contagious. Although highly educated, Mohammed was unemployed for two years as a result of discrimination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lsINo3TLAbsoFKrBhrQZCQxVxA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Other Shore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
