Opponents were imprisoned, tortured or killed.  In Guapo’y, Celsa, now in her 60s, looks back on that horrific period. Forty-five years ago, pregnant with her son, she was imprisoned and tortured. Later she learned that her husband had also been tortured and then murdered. After eight years, she was reunited with her mother, who herself had been imprisoned, and the two women talk about the traumatic past. We also hear the perspective of Celsa’s son. Celsa fights the demons in her mind with homemade herbal infusions and herbs applied to her body. The beauty of nature, which provides the herbs she carefully gathers, contrasts starkly with the horrific memories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"PY","name":"Paraguay"}],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Guarani","iso_639_1":"gn","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guapo’y","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
