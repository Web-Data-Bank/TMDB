But she immediately swapped it for a guitar, a fetish more likely to open the way to a world as dangerous as attractive, rock. From then on, starting a band is the only possible horizon for the young woman, an obsession which does not suffer any competition. Her wish came true in 1978, at the age of 27, when the American founded the Pretenders, in osmosis with three Englishmen who quickly proved to be excellent instrumentalists. Immediate success: in an England shaken by the punk explosion, the quartet composes a melodic and racy rock with heady refrains.","popularity":0.75,"poster_path":"/bzvYDjCCj6RIRH5QK9AqTgcGGGu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111446,"logo_path":"/zULDgjUJfyey9zrL6GNAKSd4Qzm.png","name":"10.7 Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pretenders - Chrissie Hynde ou la vie en rock","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
