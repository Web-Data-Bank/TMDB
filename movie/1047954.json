The first pavilion housed a 2,000-seat theatre and the second a vast entertainment complex.  Both were destroyed by fire. This is the story of over 100 years of history up to 2008. After a devastating fire destroyed the pavilion in 2008, owners Kerry and Michelle Michael immediately decided to rebuild and embarked on an amazing journey that took over two years to complete. In 2010, with the new pavilion nearly complete, everyone was working toward the re-opening.  The pavilion had to be fitted out and 300 new staff employed. Would it open on time and, more importantly, would it be a success?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wA5Z7t0P9ZqhhvsMTgCE5B3rYqr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The exciting story of the Grand Pier from 1904 to the tragic fire of 2008, and beyond!","title":"The Grand Pier Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
