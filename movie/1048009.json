A recreational area and a shooting range in the west of Asturies, which, between 1937 and 1943, housed a Francoist concentration camp through which thousands of Republicans passed – firstly militiamen, later guerrillas and their relatives. Sharing a leisurely observation with the viewer, the film intends to resignify that space, giving it back its political meaning. But it is not a question of showing –of filming– the invisible, but rather of showing what is missing in what exists today. What was and is no longer, not even in people's memories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8UDkzII4ewI4Y3ePGTlOIRAQpgc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contracampos","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
