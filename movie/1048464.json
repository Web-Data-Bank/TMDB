He’s been doing this work for more than 30 years, and lives in a container home next to the structure, where trucks and trains rumble past his window. When he is lowered into the ten-story-deep silos to clean them, he looks like a scuba diver at work. These scenes are captured with stunning, contrast-rich camerawork, and ably edited with a strong sound design.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":111463,"logo_path":null,"name":"DocNomads","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Budapest Silo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
