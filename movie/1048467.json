A few years ago, Laura (Chortle Awards nominee) evolved into a full-time wife and comedian. It didn't quite go as planned.  Following her smash debut â€˜Lovely', Laura aims her trademark comedy kaleidoscope at marriage, feminism, identity and the grinning idiots that built Stonehenge. Indulge in a whirlwind celebration of everything that's right about slowly turning into your mother and everything that's wrong with town criers.  30-something Laura's take on life is infectiously optimistic. Her clever tales of David Attenborough obsessions and dealing with a Daily Mail reading parent ooze with charisma and vibrant charm. Expect quick quips, seamless banter and up-beat anecdotes from a show certain to leave you grinning from ear to ear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g2iLXc2lJTebvDdRt9AndCPDhPQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Up Comedy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laura Lexx: Tyrannosaurus Lexx","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
