He found the majority of the pieces at \"Sharpie marker demonstration tables\" and it took almost a year to collect the artwork. All pieces were created by chance with no prior thought. He originally intended on using the photos for a collage canvas piece, however after deciding that a short film would stand the test of time longer, he took individual shots of over 30 pieces. The drone music was created using a variety of simple sound generators & tapes that are being manipulated by delays, filters, and reverberation effects.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t1F9q7LlwssIy4S50jQTGnL5oI9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drawings by Billy and His Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
