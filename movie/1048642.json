My first idea was to produce the classical “auteur profile” documentary (full-coverage interview occasionally featuring archive images), but since I was having such an inspiring and exciting chat with Raya I realized that the “institutional” approach was way too cold and inappropriate: why not present a film theory essay as if it was a home movie? After all, it was me and my father on a holiday trip...  Thus, in my little, amateurish instant-movie I applied Raya's “autohystoric” (autohysteric?) method as naively as possible, hoping to put forward a manifesto for a cinema lived on your own skin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zJD1JWAytI6oGOA1il67OTu2NWG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Separation of the Critic - A Trip with Raya Martin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
