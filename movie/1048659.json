Tia Gong, which means ‘hearsay’ in Hokkien, is an intimate yet light-hearted documentary that charts the stories of two young men who have been labelled as Ah Bengs since they were young: restaurant owner and chef Jason Chua from Beng Who Cooks, and student social worker Gary Lau from Happy Children Happy Future. They set out on their own individual journeys to seek deeper connections, question the boundaries set by society and ruminate about what the label means for them today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xbj6ISyovTqxi3f9J1JfDTzC4Ye.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tia Gong","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
