This collection of Petula’s finest moments at the BBC ranges from 21st-century performances with Jools Holland on Later right back to the 1940s when ‘Britain’s Shirley Temple’ was just a teenager, showcasing her talents on early broadcasts from Alexandra Palace. The journey from child star to icon of British entertainment includes years as one of the biggest names in television and West End musicals like The Sound of Music, as well as huge chart success, both in the UK and across Europe, especially in France where her star shone almost as brightly as it did here. Featuring much-loved classics like Downtown, Don’t Sleep in the Subway, This Is My Song and many more, this is a birthday celebration that Petula fans will not want to miss.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eze0sbCGtNeh8Tr17qRezpUnqGt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petula Clark at the BBC","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
