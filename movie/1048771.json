Her online business selling all things festive has earned her a fortune, as well as the nickname 'Christmas Carole'. But her success hasn't made her a better human being. In fact, it's made her worse. The truth is that Carole is a monumentally mean person. Positively Scrooge-like. And, just like Ebeneezer, she doesn't love Christmas at all. But this Christmas Eve, Carole's past, present and future are about to collide. Will some rather familiar Christmas spirits help her discover the true spirit of Christmas?","popularity":3.0,"poster_path":"/6ffAnG1WGjeImcq7N6dN0PsErjq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135346,"logo_path":"/hIwjhVdOOQ1fpdebwOuDQD7bnw0.png","name":"Sky Studios","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":98733,"logo_path":"/3efPGQE0OWuqlR5bxeVLWoJh2Q4.png","name":"Motion Content Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's a new Scrooge in town.","title":"Christmas Carole","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6}
