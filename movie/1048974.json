The film is the feature début of Michał Kondrat, whose previous feature documentaries have won acclaim among audiences around the world.  The film tells the story of the Primate, a spiritual leader and visionary, who talks to the communist authorities to negotiate more rights for the Church and the oppressed nation. The apparent agreement turns into a silent war: a struggle for religious freedom and human dignity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Man Who Paved The Way For Pope John Paul II","title":"Prophet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
