And life itself - life that once seemed free and endless and endlessly buoyant and hopeful - has, with the passing years, turned ordinary, prosaic, cautious and solitary. Are these the recollections of one man, looking back? Or are they the reflections of Everyman?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jav92QvH4Tqdo83V2dxIHQQzDay.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quintet: Reflections On A Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
