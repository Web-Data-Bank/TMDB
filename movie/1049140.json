The inflatable elephant reappears on a film set: the electricity is cut off, the film set and the crew disappear: the real world disappears, leaving the place to the 3D elephant, free of any support, and to the voice-over which takes control, like in a game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vuxPGos2oyTPutwJ8VEsSDgyva9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Éléphant s'évapore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
