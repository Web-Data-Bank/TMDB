Having just returned from directing a guest production at Vienna’s Burgtheater, Felsenstein had been working on Figaro since early February 1974. He had already directed three productions of the work – in 1934 in Cologne, in 1942 at the Salzburg Festival and in 1950 at the Komische Oper.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bIqEXnaezYzFCjJmWdmaerfzQTa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Komische Oper Berlin","origin_country":""},{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":166,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: The Marriage of Figaro (Komische Oper Berlin)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
