The double interview is controlled and manipulated by a computer-generated severed hand which Maria describes as an object once discovered in the trash while working in the violent northern town of Mexicali. This CGI hand was in turn produced by Max, who was born with no arms, and sought refuge in computer-imaging as a means to operate and manipulate a digital reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tGDhbpTrXm2Vuqv0yzydGBmmRO0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":2}
