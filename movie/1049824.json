The research had three interrelated dimensions: the policies adopted by the Bolsonaro administration, the violent attacks against Yanomami villages, and the destruction of the environment. The evidence strongly suggested that the policies and rhetoric of the Bolsonaro administration before and during his presidential term correspond with the rapid increase in environmental destruction and violence against indigenous peoples throughout the Amazon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":150573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forensic Architecture","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gold Mining and Violence in the Amazon Rainforest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
