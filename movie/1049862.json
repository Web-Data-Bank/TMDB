Champollion’s insights and the work of other scholars helped bring an entire civilisation back to life.  Today, researchers are increasingly interested in the authors who created these hieroglyphic works. Near Luxor, The Latest Secrets of Hieroglyphs follows a new generation of Egyptologists as they unlock the texts inscribed inside a richly adorned tomb, revealing the beliefs and lives of the priests, scribes, painters, engravers and builders who created this grand funerary monument.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y3fqOSljWtkHo364qZ4C7QTur51.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":145879,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bleu Kobalt","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BBC documentary , Egypt, Hieroglyphs ,Bleu Kobalt, France Télévisions","title":"The Latest Secrets of Hieroglyphs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
