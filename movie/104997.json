He decides to quit, but is soon lured back by one of his net-mates, Niki, who - when they meet for the first time - turns out to look strikingly like Juri. Niki has a web-address tattooed on his arm and when Juri types it into his computer, he gets drawn into a curious game that grants him the username RAT KING. As the game becomes increasingly dangerous, Niki vows to help Juri get through it. But the game triggers a series of life-threatening events and pretty soon Juri realizes that he is gaming for his life.","popularity":0.987,"poster_path":"/siY2zsXB4XNC9q6Z4FBnAYvZsSQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5974,"logo_path":"/vgPUbUDwVGL1ruiPv2KFtjh75UD.png","name":"Making Movies","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2012-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Would you put your life on the line?","title":"Rat King","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":10}
