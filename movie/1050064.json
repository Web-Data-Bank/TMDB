Multatuli was first published \"The book that killed colonialism”. In one and a half century after it was written, many scholars reflected on whether the book is a made-up story or a collection of facts. However, no one seems to have ever asked the question: what happened to the oppressed people of Lebak, which Multatuli stood up for?
