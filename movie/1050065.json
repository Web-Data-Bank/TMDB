Together with childhood friends Richard Lyons and Mark Hosler they formed Negativland, which quickly became an absurd and noisy multimedia world without boundaries, ownership or privacy. Negativland's complex chaos of plunderphonics poses both serious and silly questions about the nature of culture, media, technology, control, propaganda, power and perception in the United States of America. Is what you're hearing and seeing real or simply familiar? The medium reveals that any message is all in our heads.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lJj3hUXwgbMsOBcXV32ibVHBQ6s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stand By for Failure: A Documentary About Negativland","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
