The musical director was Alberto Veronesi, artistic director of the festival. Ivan Stefanutti was the stage director, with spectacular sets by American painter Nall and an all-star cast including Daniela Dessì and Fabio Armiliato (the singers are regarded as two of the leading interpreters of Italian soprano and tenor roles) and the baritone Lucio Gallo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/UHEWsJ43xY6iMK7duljfzc7RKy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puccini: La Fanciulla del West (Torre del Lago)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
