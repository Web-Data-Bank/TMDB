What is the normal articulation for speech? How to produce the sounds that make it up in the correct way? A physiological analysis of the aspects of speech shows us how: the jaw must move in a certain way; the air must be expelled from the lungs in another. Based on the concepts stated in the film \"Normal Speech Articulation\" (1965), produced by the University of Iowa (USA), we intend to reflect on the way women have been represented, and consequently educated, over the years, both in film and in the media. Largely composed of archival footage, this film intends to make evident, through a montage inspired by Structuralist movements, the violence of this education.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sOu4uMUNg4WJWHXNg7gxSGiTr7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69545,"logo_path":"/h3XbQjqX2LyFu1L9cKTr0ICXSX.png","name":"Escola das Artes - Universidade Cat√≥lica","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":200105,"logo_path":null,"name":"LickSickDick","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A myriad of images (from classic cinema to influencer videos) in a musical critique of the representation and education of women over the years through audiovisual media.","title":"How to Be a Candid Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
