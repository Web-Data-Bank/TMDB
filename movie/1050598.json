Yet here, the golden shine that should emanate from the king’s touch is missing, and all that’s left is an all-encompassing abstraction. This filmic fable speaks to the anonymous racialized bodies trapped under the impossible demand to fill a growing void that leaves only annihilation in its wake.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5WFaXhwzfkSaKrMFUV4y4vzX4J6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166104,"logo_path":"/cTFm04eOYFTYD8s794tUqBdSFRz.png","name":"Kuznitsa","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"I, Residue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
