Using only 35mm analogue camera. Some of the photos are archival photos during the production of GMIII: Essay 23-28 (short film project) while several other are taken in a nauseous state. During the state, the photos are barely planned and to be thought of, in resulting a pure sporadic irregular experimentation of black and white medium. An attempt of visualization the concept of duality (black (+) white) and human irrational yet vivid visual of sickness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nauseous","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
