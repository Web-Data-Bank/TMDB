Spending countless hours at the gym pumping up those muscles alone, and hours at home pumping his other muscle alone, daydreaming about the studs at the gym from the local college. To his avail he discovers he has moved in next door to a house rented by 8 hot college guys, including a few from his gym. This uninhibited group of athletic studs are more than just roommates, as Aaron finds out sharing several mutual views out the windows. While the other neighbors are always complaining about the activities going on, Aaron proves to be the friendliest new neighbor they could have wanted, by helping them with more than just their studies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2GWxyU0KfoUryXGUUbBVoSOUGKt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bacchus Releasing","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boys Next Door","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
