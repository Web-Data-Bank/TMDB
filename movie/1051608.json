Every time it erupted, people would be devastated. The gods couldn't bear the scene, and shed a tear, which turned into a water pearl and fell on the top of the mountain, forming a heavenly pool to suppress the volcanic lava. Since then, the volcano has never erupted again, and Changbai Mountain has also become full of vitality, with flowers and plants everywhere. It's unknown a spirit fox was born in the mountains. After thousands of years of practice, the guardian beast Yulin privately used the power of the water spirit beads to help the white fox transform into a human form, named Bai Lian. And a fire spirit born in the lava under the seal took the opportunity to escape from the seal and fled to the human world.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/qF2jf4PUukNDhxCFE6xZGGylF1U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2019-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legend of the Charming Fox","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
