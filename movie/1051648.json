A figure running in landscape from infinity towards and past the camera is foreshadowed by a repeating image of himself. The soundtrack, treated similarly to the image, is made from recycling loops of a heartbeat. Both image and sound progress from the unidentifiable to the recognizable. In close relation to other works from this period, the central focus is on the pattern of lines that function as the basic building blocks of the video image, structuring visual representation in a significant way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wVCxJptnoxWvYpLVkvO8eKa91CI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
