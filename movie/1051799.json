Thirty years later, he asked me to digitise the material he had filmed. I was wondering what he remembers. Created from an impulse to rethink and rewatch personal archive footage, the film explores memory and its relation to documentation and non-institutional archive practices. Connecting politics with intimate spaces, the documentary questions both the influence of war on private archives and the role of gardens as places of new begginings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/godwG3oLJc7toY2dnh2iiek9Vvy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186776,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elías Querejeta Zine Eskola","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
