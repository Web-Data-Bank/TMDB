The third film in the series, The Scientist, is about Emily Tianshi, a young woman striving to raise awareness and create solutions for the global water crisis. At age 13, Emily transformed her garage into a science lab to research San Diego’s unique Torrey Pine tree and uncovered how the tree’s unique needle structure enable its survival through years of severe drought in California. Using a $20 microscope, Legos and various household items, she developed a prototype to harvest atmospheric moisture, which has the potential to help produce water in areas of severe drought. Tianshi has applied for a patent on the device she created and is also the founder of Clearwater Innovation, an environmental advocacy program that encourages student innovation to solve environmental problems.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Generation Impact: The Scientist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
