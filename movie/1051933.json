Shifting between the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Sweden, Germany, and Indonesia, this documentary follows those whose lives were uprooted decades ago as they recall the fate-changing events and strive to find the closest way to feel home. Itâ€™s a story of life built over trauma, the right to reclaim national identity, and a quest to define home through a collective of heartbreaking memories preserved by a group of cast-out intellectuals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/en3RLBOfnlaUtJWjOjn632V00mQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lola Amaria Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eksil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
