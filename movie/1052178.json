The work, is meant to be an investigation of the concept of death, dear to me as a subject, having developed for years now an OCD toward the subject-death, in its sacredness and spirituality, understood here as an escape point from the real.

Is it in the event of death that we are definitively reunited with the One, becoming a uniform mass with one another, thus ceasing to be a numerable unity and mutating into a space in which everything is reunited?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2QjX9U2Ucl5krwtLhDpkHVjbGA2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SHEOL-ABADDON","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
