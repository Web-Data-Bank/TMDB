Personal, social and political contexts intersect into a dialogic narrative form that advances possibilities for new interpretations. The voiceover manifesto is manoeuvred to evoke personal trajectories and collective memories. By involving the essay film as a tool for creative exploring, one is able to discover and question the borders of an uncertain past, present and future. Having in mind that it’s subject - a patchwork of decontextualised memories - be they artificial or authentic, personal or historical, is something to be nursed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xf6mRabQs3Z4EVAssOMbnwMRwi9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonding Humanity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
