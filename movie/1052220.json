It raises issues of racism, cultural imperialism and environmental destruction that remain highly relevant today. The film is based on a poetry sequence by Chrys Salt and a soundtrack by British composer Richard Ingham, and is voiced by Canadian actor Peter Marinker and the poet herself. Production was supported by Creative Scotland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7xcTfuVZiXjcwDG3z2XTh9ZV3mR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skookum Jim and The American Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
