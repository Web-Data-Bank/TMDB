Threatened from all angles by extractive industries like oil drilling, uranium mining, fracking, and for-profit water pumping as well as a long history of government betrayals and broken treaties, the Greater Chaco landscape is being torn apart at a rate never seen before. Over the course of three years, Navajo and Pueblo leadership have been intimately collaborating to tell their stories in this film as they struggle to protect what little remains of this sacred landscape, including the World Heritage Site Chaco National Historical Park in the Southwest United States.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p021X01YlpulMS4ML2CArWYofw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Story: The Indigenous-led fight to protect Greater Chaco","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
