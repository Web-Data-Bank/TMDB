This programme relives the daring mission flown by the men of the 617 squadron who set off on the night of May 16,1943. Of the 19 Lancaster Bombers that departed, 8 never returned, victims of the heavy flak fire, near-total darkness and the requirement that their payload be released at the near-suicidal height of 60 feet. But, as archival footage shows, the attack was a success.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nHGWVMf8mn9yg0wh1kaVwMdIfrE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The True Story of The Dambusters","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
