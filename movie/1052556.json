From 1964 to 1973, groups such as the Rolling Stones, Animals, Cream, Blind Faith, Pink Floyd and Faces passed through London, as well as emblematic singers of that period, some with meteoric trajectory such as Otis Redding and Jimi Hendrix; others, poets of a single era, like Cat Stevens and Donovan, as well as those who would shine brighter a few years later, like Joe Cocker and Tina Turner. You can check it all out on this historic DVD, an indispensable document for anyone who appreciates the purest rock.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pexvrxyAKBKkXlxkR1p61fLl8rY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3167,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film Services","origin_country":""},{"id":187159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lioness Service","origin_country":""},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Superstars in Concert","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
