A portrait as well as a moving-image still life of heritage-brand golden watch, the film’s modes of representation oscillate throughout thus undermining any stable point of view. The film’s sound is comprised of an re-edit, referring to the practice in popular music of distilling, extracting and repeating elements of an existing track in order to maximize its use value, typically for a dance setting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/omds95q41mOOJnvpteQEZ0671Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Substance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
