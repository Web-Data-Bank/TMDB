Through intimate and quiet scenes, we explore Joesy's complex relationship with Haru. The two respect one another, because at different times, both have felt like outsiders in the U.S. - Joesy as an undocumented immigrant who fears she could be sent back to Fiji, and Haru as a Japanese American who was sent to the internment camps during World War II.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Caretaker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
