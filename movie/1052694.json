Nothing can make up for this tragic loss, but artificial eye makers Christy Erickson and Todd Cranmore combine artistry, skill and compassion to rekindle hope for their patients and families. Each eye is a masterful work of art created to be as unique as the individual who wears it. Follow the compelling journey of several patients from a state of fear to a place of hope as they are transformed by caring and capable hands. A Healing Art was produced by director Ellen Frick and Team Fly On The Wall as part of the International Documentary Challenge, a timed filmmaking competition where filmmakers have five days to make a short nonfiction film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Healing Art","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
