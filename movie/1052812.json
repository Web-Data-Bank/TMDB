She doesn't want a shared flat for senior citizens or a small room with concrete walls to become her new home - she just wants to get out into her beloved nature... Her journey on foot takes her right across Germany. From Constance to Flensburg. Alone, with a small tent and light luggage. Documentary Filmmaker Mario Kanzinger and his team accompanied her with the camera. Munay herself kept a mobile phone diary. From these authentic recordings, an intimate documentary film was made: \"Munay dances - a special journey\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ntc80ECXBQgn5WoWh2y0rSkJbYW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Munay tanzt - Eine Besondere Reise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
