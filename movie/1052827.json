I really wanted to express my feelings about traveling in a way that the viewer could feel too what I felt and hopefully even get inspired to do some travelling for themselves. By sharing my story, I want others to feel like they got some value out of it - to either get to know me better, or recognize themselves in it, or even feel inspired to go out and do what they love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are you infected by the Travel Bug?","title":"The Travel Bug","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
