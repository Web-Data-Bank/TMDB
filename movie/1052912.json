Giving her only a knife, he had told her to survive one month on the summit of Briggs before she can become his apprentice. On the second day, she had been found by some of guards of Briggs Fortress, but had managed to beat them and take their food rations. On the eighth day, she had been close to starving to death, but then had become motivated to survive. As she had learned to defend herself and live off of the wildlife, she had realized the meaning behind alchemy, saying that one is all, and all is one. However, returning after a month, it is revealed she had been talking to Silver's older brother, Gold Steiner, who is not an alchemist but rather a hand-to-hand combat specialist. Annoyed, Izumi beats him and leaves. This ends with an exaggerated look on the first meeting between Izumi and Sig.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/24d0Exy5BcE68tNJ7vjpuXztsEo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood OVA 3 - The Tale of Teacher","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
