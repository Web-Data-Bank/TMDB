Certain ones conjure joyful memories and others remind us of less happy times.  For Nenda Neururer, the word 'oachkatzlschwoaf' invokes a range of emotions. The German word is very hard to pronounce and is synonymous with the Austrian state of Tyrol where locals tease outsiders by asking them to pronounce it.  Despite growing up in Tyrol, Nenda Neururer often felt like an outsider when confronted with this word. But when she moved to London she grew nostalgic for it and it became her little secret.  Found in Translation is a series made as part of the In The Mix project, in partnership with BBC Studios TalentWorks, Black Creators Matter and the Barbican.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":187068,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Studios TalentWorks","origin_country":""},{"id":187069,"logo_path":null,"name":"the Barbican","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"'an oak cat's tail'","title":"Oachkatzlschwoaf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
