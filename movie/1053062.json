Born into surfing royalty, Mason Ho’s unique style in the water, plus larger than life personality out of the water, has put him at the top of the surfing game. Meanwhile, his friend Sheldon Paishon, who grew up on the rugged Westside of Oahu, hasn’t had it quite so easy. Director Alan Media seeks to tell the story of these two friends that grew up on the same island but under considerably different circumstances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ldOHHQt2yVTh0WRC9sSngY6iyYh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through The Doggy Door","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
