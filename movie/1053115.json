The Marapu ritual exists to be a reflection of how Sumbanese have a sacred bond with nature and their ancestral line, as if there is no line of life that is disconnected from them. Umbu Mahani Pekulangu also known as Umbu Nai Tunga is the 16th descendant who occupies the island of East Sumba. He was the last remaining king of the Sumbanese people and buried based on their belief, namely the Marapu belief. After Umbu Nai Tunga died, all of his descendants agreed not to continue the royal system, and continue with the system implemented by the Republic of Indonesia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nhsFEkd4WUU7lUZkolmt957qtt1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187012,"logo_path":null,"name":"Etanan Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2022-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maramba","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
