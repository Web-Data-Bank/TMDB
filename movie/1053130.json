Then she makes the mistake of taking her baby out of the nursery to breast feed without the nurseâ€™s permission. Kartini then becomes suspicious because her baby has thin hair and wide forehead, while the baby on her side has thick hair. Kartini and her husband, Suripno, are sure that the baby has been switched. They report this to the nurse. Nuraini disagrees and insists that the baby is hers, especially because she has a birth certificate from the doctor. The problem is taken to court and Nuraini is found guilty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/prfJn22g3JXSEb6U8Ry6QzS5I5d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Semua Sayang Kamu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
