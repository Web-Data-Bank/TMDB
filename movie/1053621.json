Mart has decided even the happiness of his children's lives, so his own daughters Miina and Leena are only suitable for nephews, because even these Lääne County people are not worth more. They do not have the wealth and pride that the Mulks have. The sighs and complaints of young people, whose hearts secretly beat in the same rhythm as the young men of Lääne County, do not help here. But since love already has a strange power that can even fly a hen into a beehive if necessary, Joosep and Juhan, young men from Läänemaa, are not going to accept such a fate so easily. Where words and persuasion do not help, trickery must be used.","popularity":0.876,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":138100,"logo_path":"/6cvw2OFBsqBPL1BAFek6eNuRqVQ.png","name":"Apollo Film Productions","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":6162,"logo_path":"/ra1wla9Ubim8l26uqSs5UZU0cWE.png","name":"Taska Film","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"The mulks are coming!","title":"Handicapped Brides","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
