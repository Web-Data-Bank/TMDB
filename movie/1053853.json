That generosity triggers horrific retaliation by the Japanese that claims an estimated quarter-million lives and prompts comparisons to the 1937-38 Rape of Nanking. The memory of the Raiders and their rescuers is kept alive by their children and grandchildren.","popularity":0.894,"poster_path":"/9XTDVlh54Kj0LFqAY0W3odLlUl2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26277,"logo_path":"/uXqiWcZbtSG2G9cQ031fRl2V0gH.png","name":"American Public Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":187105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradox Communications","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unsettled History: America, China, and the Doolittle Tokyo Raid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
