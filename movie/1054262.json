Abdulwahed cuts between this crack and simple footage of children from Lebanon’s Sabra and Shatila refugee camps playing happily on a swing. Abdulwahed has said he had initially set out to tell a more direct account of war and trauma, but because he was physically unable to reach warzones inside Syria, he felt he couldn’t do such a project justice. Instead, filming the kids, he discovered the swing they were playing on had a crack in it, which inspired him to make the visual connection with the obscured war footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yrKLM8k8q4dGVzgtBhpPbjmvaWD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slot in Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
