All the elements - the half-human half-animal figures, the strange masks, the pantomimes, the parodies and the obscenities - identify the Carnival of Skyros with the ancient Dionysia. This documentary presents the dance of the goats or \"old men\", as well as a parallel celebration organized by the fishermen of the island.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1971-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The dance of the goats","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
