Zhou was someone who lived a normal life, taking care of her mom. She has a passion for her life, such as watching and donating to the Asian Games instead of buying Jeans.  Li Mo was someone who didn't like his parents' arrangement (maybe to work at the factory). He likes writing poems and traveling. Something that was trending in China at that time but not being understood by many others. He had just completed his trip and had to go back to reality. He had that poet look at the beginning but cut it later on to show that he had moved on to his normal life.  The two met. They shared some common and trivial things. They can potentially understand each other better and treat each other as friends.","popularity":0.697,"poster_path":"/pMrNzMxOS5efiHKGqcDFptIExIn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2022-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Tomorrow's Parties","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
