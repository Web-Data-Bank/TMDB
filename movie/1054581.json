Their bodies, sometimes two and others four, are always connected with a rope, influenced by white noise retro interference, sound scratches and pauses. They approach each other until they connect and then finally completely disappear, nullifying the distance between them. The reverse movement of these similar bodies-idols aims to compose a dance of the two and the one, our close and more distant self and to reach to the void in between them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8FqQiIhlhMxtojZ3ixzq1BYcRVF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187378,"logo_path":null,"name":"cinéma expérimental","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2015-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Distant Nixa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
