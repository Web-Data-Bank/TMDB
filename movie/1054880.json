Prior to collective bargaining on wages, the company secretly signed a unilateral agreement (signed ex officio) with one of the labor union leaders and tried to put it into practice. The workers of Ulsan Hyundai Precision Industry were enraged at the sense of betrayal of the union leader they trusted and the despicable treatment of the company, and for 54 days in the hot summer, they start a strike to get a fair price for their labor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ubr00L1i1mGjf84yuJIO1ydL6Fg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"54 Days Of That Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
