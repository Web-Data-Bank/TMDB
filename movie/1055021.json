Everyone that is except for Brian. Don't let his guitar string salesman facade fool you. Brian used to play for the \"B-movie Nightmares\", but quit before they got big. Now the TV news says Brad OD'd, but Brian's going to find out what really happened. Was it a simple overdose or was there foul play? And if there was foul play, then who's to blame? A jaded drummer? A Korean Cowboy? A Satanic Ronald Reagan?! Brian asks \"just one more thing\" [ala Columbo] in his quest to seek out the truth. But no one said it'd be just another leisurely Sunday murder mystery. And it certainly won't be as polite.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overdose: Death of a Punk Rocker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
