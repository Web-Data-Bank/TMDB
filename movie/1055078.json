The documentary's main protagonists - Václav Havel, banned singer Marta Kubisová, and the underground rock group the Plastic People of the Universe (PPU) - became the most recognizable dissidents during the 1970-80s. Havel bridged the disparate clusters of individuals and fused the literary, musical, political, and philosophical nonviolent elements into a hybrid network that eventually toppled the totalitarian regime in 1989.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bX3gPRnIM7XticVmPa9GyKbgqbc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Dissent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
