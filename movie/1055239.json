Since the collection’s publication in 1926, the subject, object, or identity of its central love has remained widely debated. As scholar and translator Francisca Cho discusses, these fluctuations in meaning—a lover? Manhae’s beloved homeland enduring Japanese colonial rule? Buddhist enlightenment?—resound in the malleability of the titular nim, a word that evokes love, lover, beloved, or, as Manhae proposes in the preface to his work, “everything yearned for.” Director Han Okhi takes on the formidable challenge of visualizing the manifold meanings of Manhae’s poetry through her signature experimental style.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A2YV41fMVKiCKjObkzLGzpsilEq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nim is what I love, but it also loves me.","title":"The Silence of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
