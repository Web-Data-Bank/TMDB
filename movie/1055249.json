He was a versatile entertainer, but above all an impressionist, able to imitate more than 150 characters from the ruling class. Jope's journey was a natural extension of the post-war \"Rillumarei\" -culture. He broke through when the monoculturalism was at its most vibrant and grew in popularity as it began to crumble. With weight loss surgery, Jope sought a healthier life, but also to shed the extra pounds and childhood traumas. After the surgery, he was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, but continued to fight, developing a number of different projects, including an anti-bullying campaign together with the President of Finland, Sauli Niinistö. The project was to culminate in a joint visit to Syväkangas school, in Jope's home town of Kemi. Jope passed away before then, but Niinistö kept his promise.","popularity":0.662,"poster_path":"/ipE9NQrJHibWAgWVbJbX0WfyxKq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66903,"logo_path":"/dxybqCu0bVTa61kMLY9j6Sl0Xxd.png","name":"Yellow Film \u0026 TV","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jope – Just Think for Yourself","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
