Someone whose name she does not even know her name and even less does she know where she is: she is her father.\r Accompanying her on her journey in search of the man is Edo, a peer she met in the hospital.\r There seems to be nothing in common between Elsa and Edo except the fact that they have the same disease, from which he is now almost cured. Or at least that's what he told her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10529,"logo_path":"/3P74tUWqYr3bB2RXGcyBzJijQHb.png","name":"Notorious Pictures","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Noi anni luce","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
