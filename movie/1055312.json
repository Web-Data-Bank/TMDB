She longs for him, but she is full of doubt. A woman in the mountains tells her to find a dying tree and cure it by tying yarn around it - doing so will give her clarity, the woman says. On the way to the dying trees, Mina reflects on her relationship with Daniel. The task is challenging and puts Mina to the test, but the journey gives her a break from home with Daniel and all the noise of past events with him. She finds the silence and peace of mind she's been missing, and finally she is once again able to see her own life and Daniel in a clear light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zh03DyOMRFPZrmVF9xdLzAvbNTu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isaac Production","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":94333,"logo_path":null,"name":"Super16","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":156762,"logo_path":null,"name":"KA Productions","origin_country":"ME"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"ME","name":"Montenegro"}],"release_date":"2022-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Mountains Cry","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
