One film depicts the artist lying naked in a creek, suggesting cleansing and rebirth. In another film, \"Keane College Volcano\" at Galerie Lelong, the wind is gently stirring a mound of ash that swirls up from a stone form's breast. The bluish powder twirls up and teasingly dissipates. This breathless little dance,this choreographed chance of the elements is the best. Ana Mendieta may have written her name on the earth in disappearing ink, but she did it so well that we can't erase it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aF5jW7wyBwAD6kn543q5jl9zcVk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ana Mendieta: Selected Film Works","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
