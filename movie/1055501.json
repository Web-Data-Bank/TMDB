In the 1990s, the French humorists Les Inconnus made a remake of this TV show, where the invaders are migrants living in France. Transforming the aliens into migrants was a cynical gesture that also showed the absurdity of the extreme right discourses of the time. This video is a remake of this remake, where the world has gone upside down and the attraction from the Global South to Europe has also been reversed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q9X8og4esHvGmGXVgnHhso4WuCa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invaders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
