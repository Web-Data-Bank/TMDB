Can you live a full and targeted life after your family has been murdered  but you have undergone through ghetto and concentration camp? Not everyone has managed – many remained trapped in the past and were not able to find the strength of living on. If you asked Marģers Vestermanis, he would most probably say that there was no other choice for him. However, this film is not only a story about Marģers Vestermanis who survived Holocaust. This is a story about man's place after surviving a tragedy, about how it changes him and the ones around him. And it is also a story about us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8YhNLZesqkRZHosVrqjFVGG5umb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mēs tikai tagad sākam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
