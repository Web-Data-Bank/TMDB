Recorded at the powerful organ at Henry LeBoeuf Hall, Bozar in Brussels, this is one of Zorn’s most beautiful and personal solo performances—a dramatic musical reading of the epic Faust legend. Featuring a guest appearance by the sensational vocalist Barbara Hannigan, who is improvising with Zorn for the very first time. No one plays the organ quite like Zorn and many of his unusual techniques, usually hidden in performance, are presented in close focus. Beautifully filmed by state of the art equipment, this is a wild and colorful concert by two mavericks of new music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tmE5C7tDaC0V3z9QAXTiTFKZ2jD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tzadik","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2022-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Zorn: The Hermetic Organ Volume 10 - Bozar, Brussels","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
