Distinct and personal, her sounds are immediately recognizable as her own. For the past several years she has been incorporating visual imagery into her presentations, animating cutouts from Japanese woodblock prints in ways both charming and disturbing. Her latest work is her best yet, and draws upon the rich literature of Japanese Kibyoshi, satirical comics which pointed sharp barbs at contemporary society with a sharp focus on gossip, literature, political affairs and current events. Reversing, inverting and twisting truth and fiction, Ikue Mori creates a rich world of her own with sound and image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uylD41o81MBNgfQrho0UCJ6qSaB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tzadik","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kibyoshi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
