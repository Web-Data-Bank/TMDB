Although that memory is involuntary, it is materialized in the letters: fragments and scraps of a relationship that was once desire and that remains unfinished. The voices detach themselves from the letters but they inhabit another indefinite space-time, and that capricious dialogue seems to reveal the unspoken question: where does end up that we were in a longed-for memory? Where is that piece of identity confined, alien, dissimilar, but always close and latent?  Las cartas is born from an arbitrary discovery: photos, letters, files that are dusted off old boxes. From that moment on, the objects (which were once experiences) become the repetition of a happy or turbulent memory. That crisis, that intrinsic tension, is sought to be captured through an off recording and a visual montage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3C9w58SlzmZ0c05CaktzcMrH6OB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las cartas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
