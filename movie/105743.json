Assigned to Soviet film-maker Sergei Eisenstein, the filming followed the same path as with his previous effort, \"Que Viva Mexico\", into cost overrun and over-shooting of footage.  Furthermore, Eisenstein's usage of forbidden experimental film techniques outraged his government superiors, who ordered the film destroyed before it was even completed.  All that survives are the first and last frames of each shot, preserved by Sergei Eisenstein’s wife, Pera Atasheva. The 1967 reconstruction, by Naum Kleiman of the Eisenstein Museum and Sergei Yutkevich of Gosfilmofond, places these frames in order, approximating the original film.","popularity":1.355,"poster_path":"/tkzxPNzPlfgV38FJqNrudRg6xa1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111284,"logo_path":null,"name":"State Cinematography Department","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1968-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bezhin Meadow: Sequences from an Unfinished Film","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":22}
