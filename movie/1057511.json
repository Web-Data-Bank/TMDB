The film follows the lives of women in two brothels in the slums of Bombay. Some of the women are old, some are very young, but they have all been cheated into the business. And cheated out of life. For ten years now, Vinay, a social worker, has been trying to help them by saving them from AIDS and giving them some comfort. Although they are degraded and exploited outcasts, these women manage to retain some human dignity and cheerfulness. And some hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rzTm8naDNTUjVFx10sKmbotF3xz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Millenium Film OY","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2001-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rooms of Shadow and Light","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
