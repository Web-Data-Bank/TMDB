They´re not happy with their arbitrary leader Ronda. Though they set out to create Korean punk in the spirit of the Dong Hak Revolution, they’re too burdened by life and work. The film presents an unlikely combination of a punk band and a countryside village. The punk spirit that opposes the system and old customs gives them a reason to go on. This comedy of losers shows how they despair but rise again even in the cold light of reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2tvl5ZimNMTHvumy6O6XmA7fQc1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dong-hak Peasantry Punk Band","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
