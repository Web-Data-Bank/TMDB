Pitch Black takes us inside the claustrophobic worlds of three young men who fell down the ‘incel’ rabbit hole at an early age and are at various stages of recovery. Mark and Luke now claim to be ex-incels and are trying to shed their destructive mindset – but have their beliefs really changed, or are echoes of a hateful ideology still ringing out? Aaron is on the opposite path: full of self-loathing and rage, he lives in a bleak reality that revolves around filming self-destructive ‘blackpill’ vlogs in his car.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/znzXSbCn0VGrvcW14c2wzdtEx1m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17747,"logo_path":null,"name":"VCA School of Film and Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pitch Black","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
