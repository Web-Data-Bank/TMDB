Through its anagrammatical title and anachronistic structure, it creates a fragmented, cross-generational narrative of the Iranian diaspora through moments of collective loss, longing and violent disruption. A central question to this experimental video is how the notion of pleasure is shaped through imperial, military and state violence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5GYD2vv8KRds3YWHjyHCX55aXnd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"rial and tERROR","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
