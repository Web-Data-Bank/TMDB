Two heads of hair, one blonde and one brunette, rub against each other at the bottom of the screen. This is followed by a close-up shot of two women kissing. The camera focuses on their mouths and tongues — licking, sucking and moving between and around each other. Eventually, while beautifully filmed, it becomes almost boring to watch. The final section depicts the two women seated, naked but with heavily fabricated faces, leaning their heads on the other's shoulders—a tender epilogue to the intensity of their performance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eBFddITzHxSiejezLc3hMiiSGDl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faces","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
