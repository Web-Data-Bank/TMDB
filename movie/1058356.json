Spending his days flapping in the wind and peeking in the office window, Tony is mesmerised by a commercial for an all-new, shiny red convertible. Whisked away by his imagination, he dreams of a world beyond his own and a life behind the wheel. As time moves on, Tony becomes as tired and worn as the used-car yard. But when the car heâ€™s longed for finally arrives in the dealership, Tony is forced to break his limits to protect his dream from a group of thieves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lob1qUePCPgQmG77bdIVaDLrYcx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17747,"logo_path":null,"name":"VCA School of Film and Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deflated Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
