I thought of the image of a lonely poet = a criminal, and turned it into a story. Men roaming the streets at night, women like prostitutes, moonlit bullfights, human shadows turning into animals, clothes dancing like ghosts, etc. The song poetically depicts the desires and fantasies of men.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howl At The Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
