This animation is based on a story told by a potter in Nagata-nasa, Mimata-cho, Miyazaki Prefecture, where there are many legends of kappa (water imps), narrated by the potter himself. The artist was kind enough to share some of the ash from the local Mt. Shinmoe volcano, which he also uses as a material for his pottery.
