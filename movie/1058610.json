Nearly eight centuries after his death, Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi, Sufi master and mystical poet, is ever-present in the whirling ceremony of today’s Mevlevi dervishes.  The Halveti zikr, Mevlevi semas, and the Gharib, or secret, sema-not seen for over 100 years-were filmed in Cairo, Istanbul, and the Garden of Rumi in Konya.  This unique footage set to Mevlevi music is enhanced by interviews with Sheikh Abu Bakr Siraj ad-Din (Martin Lings), Islamic philosopher and author Seyyed Hossein Nasr, and Sheikh Omer Tugrel Inancer, who reveals the hidden meaning of the reed flute.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jz9kg96WqmcigEYwIB5dI6N1gAz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archetype Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2005-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rumi: The Wings of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
