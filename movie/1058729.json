The physician and patients are shown in the physician's office and examining room. The patients remove their clothing, and the physician takes samples from the end of the penis and makes thin smear slides from them. The techniques for stripping gonococci from male and female patients with chronic gonorrhea are shown in drawings and live footage. The physician is shown getting and preparing a urine sample for laboratory testing for the presence of gonococci, including using a hand-cranked centrifuge. The material is packaged to be sent away for laboratory diagnosis by gram stain and culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vHBl6fKKG4eA7rs6xtxgSMNjYFQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72560,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hugh Harman Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a film for physicians in technicolor","title":"Gonorrhea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
