Jen Ives is not one of them. In this stand-up show filmed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Jen takes on hot button issues, such as biology, gender critical “feminism”, the LGB Alliance, pornography & of course - JK Rowling. The conversation is as vital as ever, as everyone and their nan seems to be discussing trans women’s validity these days. The only people who don’t seem to get a say, are the trans women themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/57OeJ12FYySd0jRwC2B0a38ubYQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jen Ives: Peak Trans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
