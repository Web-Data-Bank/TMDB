Fruhauf film. Agglomerating the textures of cave surfaces with the material traces of filmic processes, Cave Painting offers a trippy visual and sonic journey for the senses that evokes an avant-garde, grunge version of the psychedelia in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Oydssey. Don’t blink, or you’ll miss something good. As always, Fruhauf conjures a new world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1kMWYUJT5OWV10w2VyxBKRwRwda.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cave Painting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
