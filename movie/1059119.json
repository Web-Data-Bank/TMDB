As the title indicates, the film focuses on Linkola's everyday activities during one day on his primitive estate and its surroundings in Southern Finland, shot sometime near the end of the summer in 2018. Thus the film is probably the last extensive footage of Linkola before his death on in April 2020 (right at the start of the COVID pandemic) and one of the few showing his everyday life during the summer more in detail. Other documentary films about him have focused more on the fishing that he did for a living during the autumn and winter months, in the luddite way that he did most things (using only a rowboat and a horse-drawn sleigh when the lake froze down).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6MLpQk2EKYr14cERYQxlqQj8XVt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dissident: A Day in the Life of Pentti Linkola","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
