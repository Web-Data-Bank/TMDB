Warm and compassionate, blunt and irascible, he leads us here through his preparations for a day in \"The Chair.\" In a remarkable and revealing conversation, he gives us an inside look at the hard life of a department store Santa including his unexpurgated opinions on kids, gold, Grammas, Mexican women, bad knees, good friends and money.  It is a bittersweet view from the other side of The Cozy Cloud Cottage -- touching, maddening and joyful. This is a portrait of Santa you've never seen before and will never forget.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6qLSubEd97C8YE6W0Irhai7N4nE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Santa Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
