On 12th May, the first contingent of USAAF personnel arrived in England, the beginnings of what was to become the largest air force in the world. The British people had never seen anything like them. Michael Brandon (Dempsey and Makepeace) presents the story of the courageous young Americans who fought the war from the foreign fields of eastern England. And of the local populations who welcomed them, resented them, admired and loved them. \"The American Invasion\" provides a powerful record of a momentous period in American and British history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jFsfKsebUBhdhOmjYeJ2KZGVVaW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Invasion","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
