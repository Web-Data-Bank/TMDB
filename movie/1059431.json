To fall flat, but also to fall heavily in love, deep into sleep, or into a holiday pool that time on a faraway Greek Island at 2am. Water acts as an important element. Waves keep crashing, summoning Deeply, Madly as an obsession with moments of be­ing mid-motion—bodies, emotions and time that all succumb to gravitational forces—from the lovesick, to the slapstick, to the macabre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aHQ0z520zn9oOR4dwL7RFbVU79p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deeply, Madly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
