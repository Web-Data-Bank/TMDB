A joyful, imaginative journey that plays with the idea that if you cannot see beauty, perhaps everything becomes beautiful. At moments it feels like an Indian Wes Anderson movie with its bright colours and witty asides that will delight audiences.","popularity":0.704,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Boy Who Cannot See The Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
