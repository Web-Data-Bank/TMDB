Salvatore and Maria are in their late 80s and the primary caregivers of their middle-aged, intellectually disabled children Luisa and Roberto. Due to recent health issues, they are struggling to maintain their parenting abilities and must figure out what’s going to happen to their children when they can no longer care for them. Luisa and Roberto’s sister, Vicky, is the driver of positive change in their lives, but this is met with resistance by Salvatore, who firmly believes it is his responsibility to care for his offspring for the rest of his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diamanti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
