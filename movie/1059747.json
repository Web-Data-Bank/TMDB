Whether he is he or she, he is on all fronts: the show, his job as an engineer, his life as a couple, his commitments to numerous associations that fight for the most precarious. Whatever the nature of this precariousness. Minima is now one of the essential figures of the Parisian drag scene. She continues the fight of her models: these drags who launched the Pride March, who are at the initiative of all the great movements for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ people and of the ostracized and despised communities. Minima Gesté / Arthur makes us discover this world of drag, its commitments which pass, and it is so much better, by the party and the disguise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zaiM2X5ib34rPlm0IwZAKjtm3c8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"His story, their struggles","title":"Minima and the Drags","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
