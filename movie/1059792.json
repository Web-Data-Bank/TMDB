This is called the Hypersea—a biological concept describing the interconnected network of nutrient-filled fluids flowing through all land-based organisms. Our blood, interstitial fluids, gastric juices, sweat and urine are daily reminders of these shared aquatic origins. Today, however, there is another material entanglement (re)connecting marine and land-based organisms: plastic. Plastic debris has spread to every corner of the earth through air and water currents. It breaks into ever-smaller bits that never fully disintegrate, and pass from environments into our bodies. In a year of pandemic, where pressure on food systems led to a worldwide public health crisis, contamination reminds us that our health is also inextricably entangled with the health of our ecosystems.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plastic Hypersea (the spill)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
