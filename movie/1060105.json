The writings and art by Matt Wagner impacted me deeply. Fast forward to 2012 and I decided to shoot a portion of it as a fan film... and it was wrought with disaster. Many of us involved in the project pushed on, hoping to still make it happen, but it eventually collapsed altogether. And I pissed off a lot of people in the process. I took on too much with too little experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grendel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
