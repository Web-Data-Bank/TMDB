Though only about 6 minutes of footage was cut together and shown at Tokyo Comic Con on November 24, 2022, Yagi and his crew intend to put proceeds from course subscriptions toward getting AKARI made as a feature film or television series. It stars the titular Akari, a woman turned giant with alien technology, fighting off a berserk cybernetic monster.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lpVSB4ZYPX4YN0hxkfw2dgrhjNC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Narō","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AKARI","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
