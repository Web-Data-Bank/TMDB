Aided and abetted by a band of musicians that includes his old partner Nelson, from the Brotherhood of Lizards, Martin performed a wonderful 100 minute show that took in both his earliest songs and brand new compositions given their first live outing. The footage lay forgotten for almost twenty years but has now been lovingly assembled & restored for your viewing pleasure by director Michael Cumming.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golden Afternoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
