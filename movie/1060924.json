From their humble beginnings as a small backyard sanctuary, we follow founders Zina and Michael Goodin, their amazing staff, and the gang of one hundred plus senior pooches, as they grow and settle into a brand new 20,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility. You’ll meet the dogs, and the people who fostered them and gave them a reason to wag their tails. It’s a tale of compassion and commitment, where love knows no bounds and as Zina likes to say, “The sky is the limit.” Old Friends: A Dogumentary, a film about a place where love never grows old.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bPzrhoPqeYTrATd1bp3WEtd0i4g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Friends: A Dogumentary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
