Western classical music has traditionally been seen as a procession of male geniuses, but the truth is that women have always composed. Hildegard of Bingen, Francesca Caccini, Clara Schumann, Florence Price and Elizabeth Maconchy - all these women battled to fulfill their ambitions and overcome the obstacles that society placed in their way. They then disappeared into obscurity, and only some have found recognition again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/FLggQClbAsDMbtvC3UGxb6ovAv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":124316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Douglas Road Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":188309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Endemol West","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unsung Heroines: Danielle de Niese on the Lost World of Female Composers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
