But no family is perfect. When Henry contracts Covid-19 while on trial for stealing files from the government, his absence from his family becomes too loud for Stella to ignore. Stella strains under the stress of raising their child alone during quarantine, battling her fraying mental health, and guilty conscience over a secret from the past. Isolated from each other, Henry and Stella are forced to ask themselves--When do you fight for the ones you love, and when do you let them go? What is modern love anyway? How do you balance your family's needs with your own? The Berg family will wrestle with these questions together over the political and social backdrop of the 2020 Pandemic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"English","title":"A More Perfect Union","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
