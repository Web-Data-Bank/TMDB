Roma are one of the largest ethnic groups living in Slovakia. Despite this, integration into all spheres of society is difficult. And it should be noted that this applies not only to Slovakia. Lun√≠k IX houses the largest community of Romani people in Slovakia. Although originally built for 2,500 inhabitants, it is estimated that the population is now three times larger. Living standards are low, with services such as gas, water, and electricity cut off, as the majority of inhabitants are not paying rent or utilities fees.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/boFLIs9q1acoPScfcEO4S2beumE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Suno (romani) - dream","title":"Suno","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
