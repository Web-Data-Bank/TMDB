The company cited financial problems, but the real reasons were to be found elsewhere. Bolivia may be a small, poor nation on the global market, but a country's fierce local food culture can be sometimes a more powerful factor than economic clout. In his first feature-length documentary, Fernando Martinez shows what happened, a story driven by the characters behind the events and their life stories, such as renowned cooks and a review of popular sayings about the Bolivian food. The symbolism is obvious when a multinational giant is 'brought to its knees' by a country's traditions and heritage.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/dSkG7X36p21vtwbNaP7vy21YBxf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producen Bolivia","origin_country":""},{"id":188428,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Filmmaker Studio C.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":188429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Azpurua Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":8194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lagarto Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fast Food Off the Shelf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
