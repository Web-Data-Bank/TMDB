Memories of its childhood in Guinea, laborious and happy at the same time, the inevitable fleeing with its parents to reach the Libyan coast, the crossing of the Mediterranean and their rescue during which its mother disappeared haunt its memory. Disguised as a boy, this child is the daughter of a journalist and political refugee. They start a new life together. A contemporary family adventure, a child resilience tale, a huge and indispensable testimony.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5BAkOAULc8a9lfKdI08lK6EXh8a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Godo Films","origin_country":""},{"id":188435,"logo_path":null,"name":"Olé Film- und Fernseh­pro­duk­tion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Alpha Two's Dreamed Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
