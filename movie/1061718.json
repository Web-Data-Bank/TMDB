BELA, 19, is two months sober from alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, and ketamine and a month behind on rent. To cope with his increasingly burdensome recovery, he spends much time meditating and putting on finger puppet shows for his boyfriend, ADAM, 22, a former hustler and current odd-job man who is struggling with the recent death of his father. MUFF shows the world a snippet of how these two survive submergence in their own passion, disgust, and desires.","popularity":0.657,"poster_path":"/c705YRUMx8yztGwubEoX9DGdOXt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MUFF","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
