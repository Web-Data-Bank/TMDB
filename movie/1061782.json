Boccaccio and Fiammetta fall madly in love on Easter Day in the church of San Lorenzo Maggiore. But fate does not seem to help the two young people's love. Princess Giovanna, in order to avoid getting married to Andrea of Hungary, devises a plan to poison him, placing the blame precisely on Fiammetta, who had meanwhile been hired at court as a servant. Boccaccio, with luck and daring, manages to prevent Fiammetta from being blamed. Princess Giovanna will marry the prince of Hungary, and Fiammetta, finally recognized as King Robert's daughter by her natural mother, will be able to crown her dream of love with Boccaccio.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3ghUGWPX4k7HRaiAZc9VPN9CWxS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188452,"logo_path":null,"name":"TILE","origin_country":""},{"id":188453,"logo_path":null,"name":"digitalcomoedia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Fiammetta","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
