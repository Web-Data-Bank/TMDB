Having the ocean underneath and the forest behind, living their daily lives and taking care of each other, as siblings do. That changes one day, when children find a robot which somehow ended up in front of their door after a big night storm. The robot is out of battery, but once they figure out how to power it on, they find out that their destination is the same place: a utopian city called Ekk, where they think their lost mother is waiting for them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yYCruYKuEiQZrhvGHKqR0BVtRqc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188475,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARCHA Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Otis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
