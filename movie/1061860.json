It is there that Jane is sent to her grandmother Granny Onion’s, while her mother Cécile needs time to take care of her depression. It is also there, in the forest, that lives Cloclo, the giant musician bum who has taken Jane under his wing. It’s also the place that Granny Onions finally leaves, but for good this time. In each of these stories, our characters are shaken by the weather of life, with all its hardship, but also its beauty, festivity and poetry. With its heavy rains and sunny spells. Three exquisite stories to spark joy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pY35PgQZyrHXPbcnVaSY82NMUto.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laïdak Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Round and Round the Wishing Well","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
