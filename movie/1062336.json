Henpecked common-law husband Craig Meehan seems to have an unhealthy obsession with his laptop.  Borderline special needs uncle Michael Donovan just wants a bit of company and a couple of quid for some baccy.  Stereotypical Yorkshire copper D.I. Radgitt faces a race against time to unravel the web of lies and find the missing girl, Shannon Matthews, aged 9.  This is Shannon Matthews: The Musical, an irreverent, potty-mouthed, black comedy romp through one of the most bizarre news stories of this century. The production has been brought out from under the bed base by Yorkshire’s own Tuppence Ha’penny Theatre Company.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fAwNMJOrN3WbmwTSEstLrUVzjNM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not for the easily offended!","title":"Shannon Matthews: The Musical - Live at Edinburgh Fringe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
