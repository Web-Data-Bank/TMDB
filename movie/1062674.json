It seemed to be a suitable solution for modern warfare, because by means of this radiation a complete mind control of own troops was possible. However, devastating effects on the human organism soon became apparent. Widespread eczema and discoloration of the skin were the result. At the same time, an insatiable craving for human tissue suddenly appeared among the test subjects. As a result, the experiments were stopped and Dr. Nailz was dishonorably discharged from the German armed forces. A few years later, when all the employees of a large service company inexplicably disappeared, the secret organization Radium was put on the case.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":188607,"logo_path":null,"name":"Downstairs Video Team","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Subline - Machen wir's auf eigene Faust","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
