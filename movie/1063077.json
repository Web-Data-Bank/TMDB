No senior England football team had claimed a major tournament title since 1966 until the women’s side secured an unforgettable 2-1 win in the final against old enemies Germany. This documentary features all the key moments on the pitch, while candid interviews with the likes of Williamson, player of the tournament Beth Mead and England stalwarts Jill Scott, Ellen White and Lucy Bronze offer a unique behind-the-scenes insight. BBC pundits Gabby Logan, Ian Wright, Alex Scott and Fara Williams also offer their thoughts on what was a breakthrough summer for women’s footballers, and female sportswomen in general.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/idR4BaljJEURMuuoZ5QBbCYZb1l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16986,"logo_path":"/nBWSAxcnFYeh5xYWoGtZoEWk8a.png","name":"BBC Sport","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lionesses: Champions of Europe","video":false,"vote_average":9.7,"vote_count":3}
