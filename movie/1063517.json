He has a daughter Kalpana and a son Raja. Distrusting his son and his new wife, Roopa, he asks a village laborer, Sunder who is honest, loyal and hardworking, to marry his daughter. In this manner, Sunder and Kalpana get married, and soon Kalpana gives birth to a daughter. Tragically Kalpana passes away, and the Thakur, Sunder, and the child are devastated. The Thakur asks Sunder to get married to Savitri, who is the daughter of his childhood friend, the local Collector. He hopes that in this manner the child will get the love of a mother. Sunder reluctantly agrees, and soon Savitri and he get married. Savitri is unable to win the love of the child nor does she get any affection from Sunder, as he is unable to get Kalpana out of his mind and thoughts. In the meantime, Roopa's dad is plotting the death of Sunder, so that his daughter can take over the wealth of the Thakur after his death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3X4R7rCDtDC5IxRVftSm8tcI84u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":158,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rishte Naate","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
