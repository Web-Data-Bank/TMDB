Pre-school is the first and last time boys and girls can learn together freely before entering the strictly segregated education system.

As his curiosity grows, the complicated real lives of the other pupils start to unravel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/X1N5puLb8S44bJTOTnNzbWZc4U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2023-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Numb","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
