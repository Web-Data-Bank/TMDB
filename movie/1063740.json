At a time when African-Americans, women, LGBT and other minorities had few options for participation in society, a dance-based culture was born that encouraged total freedom of self-expression and communion with your fellow men and women. This underground subculture grew steadily over the next two decades but in the 1990s Mayor Giuliani resurrected forgotten Prohibition-era Cabaret Laws, which strictly regulate social dancing, successfully shutting down venues and repressing the city's once vibrant dance scene. To this day, dancing remains illegal in most bars and restaurants in 'the city that never sleeps.' freedom2dance chronicles the history of these restrictive laws through the lens of New York's legendary dance subculture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9jAg0hg25f5ahDXmyPaKTnPwd6d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"freedom2dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
