Guided by the eldest among them, they operate like an agrarian commune with strict rules and beliefs. Adults are banished into the surrounding woods, and every year, the oldest member of the village is sent to jump off a cliff – a ceremony that is believed to bestow eternal youth on the chosen one. This way of life is threatened when one adventurous child heeds the call of the forbidden forest.","popularity":0.752,"poster_path":"/2xv8SCba9GFGDoLHdtqeBnCtuyU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Primeira Idade","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Age","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
