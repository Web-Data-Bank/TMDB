Teenagers arrive on bikes to walk down to a river embankment and while away the hours, swimming and feeling like the emperors of the universe. Folks a little older arrive at a house for lunch and conversations. The children are having fun in the concrete jungle between houses – a realm only they know. When darkness falls, soon only the teenagers remain, singing now and in a mood to make merry. Dawn will see their hangovers and their happy tears.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jf0SNP9abZL2CyRl2xsZFwWWk2c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185925,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sabotage Kollektiv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
