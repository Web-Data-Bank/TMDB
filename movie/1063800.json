For one: Celeste is a bit tricky. Like, classic Nintendo levels of challenge. Pixel perfect jumps, mad puzzles and the like. Due to this and its retro aesthetic, there has been comparisons to top-tier indie platformers like Super Meat Boy as well as golden era classics like Megaman 2 and Mario 3. It is also a truly amazing game. IGN gave it a perfect 10, it has a Universal Acclaim rating on Metacritic and currently sits as the 3rd best rated game on Switch.  No wonder Nintendo snapped it up for their console.  But what elevates it beyond its indie platform brethren is its heartfelt story:  The tale of Young Madeline's self-imposed struggle to climb the eponymous mountain. The mountain, as is often the case in fictional works, is a metaphor. A metaphor for her anxiety and depression. Your task in Celeste is to overcome all three.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celeste: Overcoming the Mountain","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
