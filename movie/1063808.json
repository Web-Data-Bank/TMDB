An irregularity of rhythm (produced by repetition of frames 2, 3 and 4 times) creates the sense of a driving force propelling the inter-weave of these essentially abstract displays: three-fourths of the way through the rhythmic intensity falters, 'breaks down' as it were, almost becomes a mockery of its earlier sexual regularity. Instead of variety midst regular beat, the forms suggest some loose variance. Two formal factors seem to 'save the day,' as it were: (1) an increase of beseeming textures, and (2) interruptive white flashes; and these create a meaningful (rhythmically and tonally coherent) ending.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lovesong 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
