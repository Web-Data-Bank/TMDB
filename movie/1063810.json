There is a sense of pulsing darkness which breaks ints curled lines into coupling body forms which then settle back into something like the beginning of the film.  Lovesong 6  Bright and very \"hot\" non-organic hand-painted colors and interweaving forms which darken intil cracks of ephemeral blues appear. There is, throughout, a gentle rhythmic \"push\" of hot-colored forms against each other, a sense of totally pervasive calm. Finally the textures of cracks gives way to some sense of sands-but as a softness. The lines which suggest coupling exist finally as if rubbed smooth by shifts of grain and gently shattered forms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lovesong 5 & 6","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
