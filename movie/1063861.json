While he considers emigrating with his daughter, he clashes with his new partner, a young go-getter on the fast-track up the bureaucratic ladder. A mature directorial effort by Cheuk Wan-chi, this dramedy about Hong Kong’s civil service culture and the latest emigration wave is a charming,  yet sobering love letter to her city and its people, especially those who still remain.","popularity":0.888,"poster_path":"/kNi9ow8Srgq0UssdYiCNHBwafas.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69437,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Cool Film Production","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":175902,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Universal Culture Limited","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vital Sign","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
