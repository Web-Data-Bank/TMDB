In the street, Muscovites sell shoes, a dog and a monkey are sturdily dressed, the escalator takes us out of the metro while others swim in a steaming outdoor pool. Sometimes, to make a living, people dress up as clowns or wolves to lure passers-by into stores.\r The wolf gives the narrator his phone number. He is young and his name is Ilia Krone. His mouth is the same shape as hers like a perfect harmony. Moscow seems empty to him when he is away. \"He has a head for wanting to come to France\" a friend told him. Besides, things don't get better with time. Moscow is a city where it is said that the colder it is, the more people start to lie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hAICbYaTlE5STq2y2RaNykWtAmc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Rêve De L'Ours","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
