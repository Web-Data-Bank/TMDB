Prayers and ritual must be done to help her consciousness into its next rebirth, but the nunnery coffers are empty. The senior nuns decide that the only way out is get back money loaned out by the nunnery. A mysterious loan was made out to an equally mysterious Mr. Tashi who visited the senior nun in her last days. Given the shady rumours about Mr. Tashi, the nuns are convinced he took advantage of her in her dying state.  Two nuns are assigned to retrieve the money; Karma, a free-spirited nun, and her opposite, a textbook-sort of nun called Sonam. They journey from the cloistered world of the high mountains of Nepal, to the faraway cities of sin, to find the elusive Mr. Tashi.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nkEXBLiVJzVUMMOR7EsVy1pFUX5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"2012-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""},{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
