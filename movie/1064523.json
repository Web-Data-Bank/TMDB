This has him in hot water with instructor Randy Spears. Narrative finesse isn't this volume's strong suit, and the function of what plot there is here is, (surprise, surprise), to get pudenda knocking and the talent huffin' and puffin'. Trouble is, while all of the action captured here is viable stroke fodder in a home-alone-yet-again sort of way, none of it conveys much in the way of genuine heat or real desire on the parts of the pole-planting principals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"University Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
