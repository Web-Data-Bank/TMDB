War and Melodrama in Hollywood's 30s and 40s","overview":"A fictional journey constructed from small movements of bodies as portrayed in melodramas and war movies of the 30s and 40s in Hollywood cinema, beginning and ending with intimate gestures of life being at once destroyed and transformed. The absence of faces records a fragmented, mutilated and re- constructed history through a body language that has been overshadowed by the prevailing photogenic of the Star System. The faceless body enlightens an anonymous side, erasing the identity of the actor/character in a continuum of dai- ly actions, fleeting contacts, loving offerings and deathly silences in the heat of war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6pwms4ga5yO5iHgM8fV6ZdlmCLR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hidden Gesture.
