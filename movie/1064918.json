The cinema invites us to suspend our criteria of credibility and makes us believe that mice speak, a man in a cape flies with just stretching out an arm and that in life it is enough to wish something very much for it to happen. Even if we know that it is not true, seeing it before our eyes gives us an imagination to be able to think about it, desire it or recognize it if one day we see it. Rewind's proposal escapes the physical laws and shows a reverse direction time, a rewind. Because, the way things are in the world, we can't think of another fairly credible way to give a happy ending to a horrifying and real situation, that of the stoned women. We propose to see it in order to imagine it, to imagine it in order to desire it, to desire it in order to do something about it.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/aVCcJ68UYTaUm8AcRmia0SJU90n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rewind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
