The magenta-shifted fragments of an educational film on \"Reaching Your Reader\" reveal their chemistry where the splicing tape ripped a \"ruby skin\" of the emulsion away from the base of the film, leaving a green tear at the edit points. Ruby Skin is a material homage to the disappearing medium and some of its idiosyncrasies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruby Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
