This 'mini' Olympics of Christmas is a multi-ethnic story of unity in diversity. It celebrates how we are all different, but the same, or how we are all 'same difference'. It reminds that Christmas transcends skin colour and racial barriers. It's a rib-tickling comedy that aims to unite borders by helping each of the nations represented to also debunk long-held negative stereotypes and perceptions that the general public always had about them. And of course, somewhere in between all of these, we are treated to endless servings of Akpos' mis-adventures.","popularity":0.975,"poster_path":"/bpk7OXQvrmlJ5rDZBANPMqcWmlR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christmas in Miami","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
