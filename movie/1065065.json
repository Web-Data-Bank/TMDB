All three sites were built with certain worldviews: visions of the future and US-influenced promises of progress that didn't turn out to be the utopias they presented themselves as. Through multi-lingual texts, a site-specific soundtrack, 16mm and 3D images, the spaces and their implications are subjectively mapped, poeticized and questioned. A poetic materialism of decay, renewal, remembering and projecting, \"Center, Ring, Mall\" is perhaps a mourning, but one that desires and demands a rebirth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hCL4fEaBdITjOf5LRokEKlkBWUB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Center, Ring, Mall","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
