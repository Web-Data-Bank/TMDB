As director, animator, storyboarder and co-editor, Dawson possesses a rich talent and passion for the filmmaking craft, particularly in animation, graphic design and visual effects which he showcases on his public Instagram account @n.nitsuj. Further, Lightfoot is an obsessively passionate writer, editor, sound designer and producer, and together the pair make a dynamic duo to be reckoned with.  Their debut short film 'Ironing Board' marks the beginning of both Lightfoot and Dawson's filmmaking careers, and the two are itching to create future projects.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7A1485CAsiWrke4LdUDWvl9BjeQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's no kindness in being submissive.","title":"Ironing Board","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
