Nobody knows since when it bears its name, but everyone has heard of a tragic episode that took place here in 1916â€¦ Or were there many such episodes ? A few years after the Mexican Revolution of 1910, a massive exodus took place within the country, as deportations and violence targeted Chinese and Asian migrants who had settled in Mexico for many decades. Despite a lack of documentation about the site, it is thought that many people died here while crossing the desert from mainland Mexico. Myth and identity, reality and fiction, ghosts and memory. El Chinero can in some way be seen as a monument to the memory of these forgotten, anonymous people while not officially being one. A site of tragedy with no traces nor remnants to be seen. How can one fill this memory void with images and artifacts in an attempt to construct an archive where none exists ?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sKbr0n6hJdovTn2P2NZ5fLORl5F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2022-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Chinero, a Phantom Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
