The images generated in the tape act according to specific parameters set by the artist. Sandin has stated \"The analog Image Processor was programmed to implement the logic equations; if square, if triangle and circle show circle.\" In this tape, Sandin is in effect arguing for a distinct video vocabulary that replaces the classical concept of perspective. This tape was produced at the University of Illinois Chicago.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triangle in Front of Square in Front of Circle in Front of Triangle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
