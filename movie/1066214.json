The series is focused on infusing environments of motion and time inherent in cinema with traditional visual art themes. 'Volume 1' involves six scenes which each showcase a different genre of photography or painting interpreted through cinematic movement and duration. Each scene is comprised of a single stationary shot reaching the 30-second maximum shot length of the hand-wound Krasnogorsk-3 camera. While 'Motion Pictures for Wall Frames' can be screened through traditional cinematic formats, the project is designed to be shown framed on a wall, either through projection or digital picture screen, much like a framed photograph or canvas. This concept originated from Eubanks' desire to see works of cinema showcased similarly to how pictures and paintings are commonly displayed across the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kk2wSXmRD7OGVtmg9H339PewV25.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189162,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Apothetae Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motion Pictures for Wall Frames: Volume 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
