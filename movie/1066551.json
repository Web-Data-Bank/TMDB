The discussion with Joseph Morder continued in a café on the Boulevard de Sébastopol opposite No. 102 where the cinema Le Palais des Arts was located. It was there that the Cinematons were shown for the first time in Paris in June 1978 and that Joseph Morder awarded me a Morlock prize for Cinematon and Rasage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sj13jd0MPXdAbwTEpCo0BvDE8W2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Place Saint Michel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
