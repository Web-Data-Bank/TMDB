This is not LA.  In this film the protagonist ( Rowland ) emerges from the sea almost as primal man. He is Ecosexual, he transforms himself into a clay living sculpture, he becomes a 70’s movie character and at the end he returns to the sea. It presents the male body as erotic object and as thinking, feeling subject.  This is a poetic film about water. Water is represented as a cleansing element; as a substance that restores man to his original form. Water as a nurturing element; as a substance that can hold the entirety of a man’s weight.  In this film water is an element that is distinct from man: feminine, fluid, translucent. The hardness of a man’s cock, the strength of a man’s body, the power of a man’s ejaculation are made even more masculine in the presence of water.","popularity":1.299,"poster_path":"/25CE3NTCzjjtEpN0IDHL6da1mWL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antonio da Silva Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Mirror","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
