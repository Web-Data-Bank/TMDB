He and Princess Ella love each other and want to get married and discover the world together. But Ella's father King Wilbur does not accept it. He traps Gaspard in a dungeon and makes his daughter believe that he has gone around the world.  In prison, Gaspard meets Lucas \"The Strong\", who is stronger than 10 men, and Flora \"The Witch\", who orders plants. Thanks to Lucas, they escape from prison, and on their way they meet Marcus \"The Runner\", who carries an anvil in his bag to prevent himself from running faster than the wind; Benjamin \"The Marksman\", who has a view that carries further than that of an eagle; and Lisa \"The Icy\", who has a breath of ice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uqQX6QcYbR5DQSwVmzJRFRR1nHG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sechse kommen durch die ganze Welt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
