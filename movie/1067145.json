Born of Polish and Czech origins in what is now Slovakia, he soon showed solidarity with his new fellow citizens, due to the political troubles. A chemist by profession, he invented over 80 patents in various fields: from a hot water bottle, a precursor of the vacuum flask and a rotating toothbrush to medicines, detergents, insecticides, a brake system, the first anode battery, a compound for gramophone records and a fountain pen. 45 years before Sir Christopher Cockerell and his hovercraft, he came up with a craft that floated on air, and the principles of the helicopter. Croats were indebted to him for his patriotism, his invention and his construction of the first domestic aircraft, only a few years after the Wright brothers, as well as his role in the industrial development of the country in the early 20th century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5JKVd1er4aEo63wDnB6NNg7zYgS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penkala","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
