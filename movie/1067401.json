He quickly discovers an unexpected fame after his discovery is shared to the world, but that fame is short-lived because there is something or rather someone that gets in the way.  The World Habitants' Authority and Trust Corporation step in to capture Logan Wright, as they do not want this cure made public. Logan quickly learns what W.H.A.T. Corp. is; a secret organization that controls the world.  In the W.H.A.T. Corp. Headquarters he meets Agent Ember who offers him a position in the company in exchange of making the cure again, only now for private and elite clients.
