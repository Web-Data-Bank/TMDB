In the film, Miguel Calderón follows the weights of Chameleon for 24 hours, a falconer who works at night as a bouncer in a bar in the south of Mexico City, and who by day goes hunting his falcon every night, with whom he has developed a relationship. Emotional bond is his closest bond with a reality far removed from the situations of extreme violence to which he has been exposed since childhood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camaleón","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
