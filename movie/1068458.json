Starting with the release of Sir Cliff's first single Move It in 1958, we follow his incredible career through his appearances on a variety of BBC music programmes and television specials. The programme takes in his early, much-loved songs of the 1960s, the comeback and credibility of his work in the 1970s, the successes he enjoyed throughout the 80s and 90s, as he consolidated his reputation as a pop superstar, right up until the controversy and vindication that came with his Millennium Prayer.  Amongst the classic songs featured are The Young Ones, Living Doll, Bachelor Boy, the Eurovision Song Contest contenders Congratulations and Power To All Our Friends, Devil Woman, Miss You Nights, Wired for Sound and Cliff's much-praised 80s duet with Van Morrison, Wherever God Shines His Light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xt2PFLw3NXSXqI3Yr1g0dKp3aNx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sir Cliff Richard at the BBC","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
