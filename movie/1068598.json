Artists, teachers, researchers and intellectuals are opposing the social rethinking imagined by the MEDEF and applied by the liberal power. Through a year of debates and actions, they are trying to raise collective and citizen awareness, by recalling the very foundations of our society that once gave birth to Human Rights. The ambition of this film is to give an understanding of this turning point in society, based on the voices raised in the struggle and to question the alternatives made possible by the social movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A6bhS5L5HuCfr8uQwylbHqoM5jV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La carotte et le bâton","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
