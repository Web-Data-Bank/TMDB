Back in the schoolyard, Tony pretends that he has a car to go with the remote control. When another boy tries to take the control from him, it falls on the ground and a red remote-control sports car miraculously appears. The car \"dances\" to rap music and even brings Tony a can of soda. One day, a sinister-looking man with a briefcase steals the car and flees into the subway. Tony and his classmates pursue the thief to the Wall Street area and ask to inspect the briefcases of passing businessmen. Eluding the students, the crook hails a taxi and hurls the briefcase from the window. Next morning, Tony hears the sound of a sports car during a church service. Returning to its rightful owner, the magical car mysteriously reappears at the end of the processional.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uLuyOt57l0tp3RJtUPPZdbwWHn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5942,"logo_path":"/qx0un6M3qWa9gioQX46rlLqSF97.png","name":"TAKE ONE PRODUCTIONS","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Boy and His Car","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
