In the early 2000s, a powerful flux of poisonous hermaphroditic cells was first spotted in the French cities of Metz and Strasbourg, before infecting large delimited areas of the western and eastern web. A.H. Kraken, Maria Violenza, Scorpion Violente, Noir Boy George, Les Morts vont bien, or SIDA are some of the backbone elements of this vertical 3 branched centipede who would have gladly left the organs of a worn-out counterculture at death's door, rather than knocking it with an ultimate electroshock. A bad taste joke, ephemeral in its core, rigorously immortal, the GTAIE continues to perpetrate its crimes, sometimes under the spotlight, always clandestinely.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fDNVdn6ldzHFmO74AP3DDZNzkuD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Grande Triple Alliance Internationale de l'Est","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
