All have been hard won.  Knowing the Score gets up-close and personal with Simone in an engaging, luscious music documentary revealing two key themes; the long struggle for gender parity in the high art of classical music and the heart breaking struggle for artists to be valued in times of crisis, or sometimes even at all.  Though one of the world’s great contemporary conductors, Simone’s work continues to be viewed through a gender lens. Simone is the first woman to be appointed Chief Conductor of The Sydney Symphony Orchestra in all its 90-year history, a post she takes up in 2022.","popularity":0.909,"poster_path":"/rcTVBqmyc2yJSzandyTBuR93L7Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Serendipity Productions","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":7584,"logo_path":"/eGkfvvyf4fJTvBUR1xt1669IPA3.png","name":"Screen Australia","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":104145,"logo_path":"/pXEmryDYZUOHAeb218RcKQgdJ4t.png","name":"Create NSW","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":1253,"logo_path":"/6f0A0AqIPHYheRb90tVMutuzSnP.png","name":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knowing the Score","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
