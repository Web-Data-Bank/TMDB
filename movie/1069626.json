The luminance information (voltage) from the visual images traversed by the black dot is routed to an oscillator to produce the audio signal, which varies according to the changing luminance. The video image itself then triggers the audio. The shifting grey-scale of the image becomes a two-dimensional sound map or audio score.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":150334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Experimental Television Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music on Triggering Surfaces","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
