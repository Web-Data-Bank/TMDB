With Duality, these street artists– some for the first time, some maintaining a strict code of anonymity – discuss their journeys from “tagging” to becoming respected icons in the cities they serve with pieces that are awe-inspiring in scope, size and complexity.  They have collectively proven that their genre of art is something that can influence culture, evoke emotion, inspire, and cultivate community.  Their rise has not been without challenges and criticism but today they are admired by throngs of fans and oftentimes the art they produce brings in revenue for household brands and worldwide corporations. No longer relegated to back alleys, their works can be found on main streets, on the faces of landmark buildings and in fine art galleries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"a graffiti story","title":"DUALITY","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
