But it is precisely these two who are doing everything they can to end his beautiful life behind his back. The first attempt fails and leaves Andreas in a wheelchair. No one is really satisfied with this, and so he is tipped into the sea with a wheelchair at the next opportunity during a boat trip. What his wife Eleni did not foresee, however, is that her lover Hermes Cockroach turns out to be a plentiful scumbag afterwards. What both did not foresee is that Andreas also survived the second assassination attempt. . .","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":151678,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.S.
