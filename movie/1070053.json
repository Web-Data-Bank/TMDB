While it borrows images from Kafka's Metamorphosis and from Jack Arnold's Incredible Shrinking Man, it is not an interpretation of either. This is a film about logic that feeds on itself. In developing its own peculiar logic, the film plays with narrative form. A METAMORPHOSIS IN LOGIC is the meditation of a man who can't decide whether he has gone too far or not far enough.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j9bab9MTtaBNXvwWHBcgn1acwsl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Metamorphosis in Logic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
