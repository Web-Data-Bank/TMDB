Each one, eager to woo her, makes an equally strong plea with apparently the same impression, although she seems slightly to favor the horseman. After listening to their declarations of love, she dismisses them with an evasive answer. With no decided preference she is in a quandary. She does not want to lose an opportunity, but how to make a choice is a difficult problem. She has an idea. She writes them a letter and sends it to the hotel: \"The first one reaching my home and me can claim me as his bride.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
