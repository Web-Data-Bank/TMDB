Nellie is very fond of ranch life and it is her custom to spend part of the time at the Bar X, which is close by, while her father is undergoing all the delights of being \"Boiled out\" in the sulfur baths. Nellie meets all \"the boys\" and is particularly impressed with Jim Edwards, who constitutes himself her guide at the ranch. One day a horse runs away with her, and Jim neatly ropes it and thereby saves her life and wins her love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
