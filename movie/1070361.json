One morning, as he was eagerly following a large hawk, which he had already wounded, he lost his balance on the edge of a cliff and plunged down to the stony ground below. His cries for help attracted Walsh's attention and he was taken to the latter's cabin, where he was tenderly cared for by Walsh and his wife, until he was able to return to his duties in the east. Walsh's wife was the apple of his eye, but, like most things that we love, she did not last, and twenty years later we find him a broken old man, living in the days that are gone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lwbt3O0r2s7UGsoxH4izFTwjLTN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
