When we had the opportunity to follow Alonzo in all the steps of the creation of his latest album, Quartiers Nord, we had to tell the story of this artist who has crossed all the eras of French rap while preserving authenticity and modernity. Since the beginning, he has divided his life between his artistic career and a family reality that hit him at the age of 16 with his first daughter, Kenza. Music and family remain intimately linked for Kassim. When he recorded his last album, his wife was about to give birth to their sixth child. The film retraces these moments of joy, of sharing, of doubt too. Capo reste Kassim is a sincere dive into the life of one of the most important artists of French rap.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4x7srHKJVLB6ER951cOLIJ5hHGX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Capo reste Kassim","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
