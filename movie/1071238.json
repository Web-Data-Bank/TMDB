Attractive comedienne Ping vows to become a viral Youtuber. She concocts a plan to put on a show of marrying herself in what was meant to secure both money and likes! However, the scam ultimately ended up in the discovery of her true self in this coming-of-age fairy tale comedy.  To love others, I must love myself. Simple enough, right? But who am I? In a pageant of love, four contest as lovers, each one goodhearted in their own right. Does Ping want all four or none at all? By marrying herself, can she figure out who she really is? And who she really loves? Ping will tell it all on the day of the solo wedding…  In this satire of marriage and the individual self, nothing is left untouched: women, men, organised religion, homosexuality, the filthy rich, not to mention ye good old mother!
