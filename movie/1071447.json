The money she makes packing tights in a factory isn't enough to cover her rent, and her TV is repossessed. Soon after the funeral she meets Arnold, a wealthy pub landlord, who squires her to the local Conservative Club ball in an effort to cheer her up. Life with Arnold promises not only companionship but undreamt-of luxury, but Marjorie's friends and family do not necessarily approve.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zajRWOe5DEeJcQSYQEJ1s4RTTQP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Small Mourning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
