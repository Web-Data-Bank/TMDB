The staging was notable for two other milestones, as Oksana Lyniv became the first woman to conduct at Richard Wagner’s legendary Festspielhaus since its opening in 1876, and the sensational Lithuanian soprano Asmik Grigorian made her house debut with a standout performance as the opera’s heroine, Senta. The exceptional cast also included John Lundgren (The Dutchman), Georg Zeppenfeld (Daland), Eric Cutler (Erik) and Marina Prudenskaya (Mary).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2A6PHPpzT7KViqf7xd6lw7P8Mej.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":4035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skyline Film \u0026 Television","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":79593,"logo_path":null,"name":"BR Klassik","origin_country":""},{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":11299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bayreuther Festspiele","origin_country":""},{"id":189981,"logo_path":null,"name":"BF Medien GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der fliegende Holländer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
