There are six people aboard a boat, two silent musicians, two boatmen speaking Irish, two women, English. One boatman's brother is on the run from the police, one of the ladies has lost her wedding ring.

The Victorian tour of old ended with the loud report of a cannon resounding through the surrounding wild.
