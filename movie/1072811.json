Thanks to her, many Estonian men are much better men. It's unbelievable that Lydia is in her seventies. She is extremely vital and full of energy. It is no problem for her even to have a football match with the boys. After all, age is nothing but a number, and she proves it.  The film's culmination is the Estonian Song Festival in 2019, one of the largest choral events in the world, where Lydia is conducting the united boys' choirs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lydia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
