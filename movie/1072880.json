The play’s original chronology has been broken up and fragments of Peer’s life reordered – all observed by an aged spirit who is on the threshold to the other side. Maurstad’s acting is “overwhelmingly great. He carries the role of Peer Gynt on his 92-year-old shoulders. This is pure theatrical magic.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b0uisjPqIjrORt03FMPCPviRd4V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belvedere","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2020-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peer Gynt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
