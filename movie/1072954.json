But the sixteen year old did as she pleased, devouring life to the fullest. Madly in love with her first flirt of the same age, she falls pregnant with him and decides to keep the baby. She hides her pregnancy from her parents, from the doctors, and come what may. Julie has defied the adult world, armed with a conviction in the form of a lesson for all: it is because life can be short that it must be intense.","popularity":0.933,"poster_path":"/eNGyNp2d3KdLPXPGb53sBTWwZH5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vema Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La vie, l'amour, tout de suite","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
