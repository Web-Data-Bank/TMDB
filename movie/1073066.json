Melanie Chait documented the last four years of her life-partner, theatre director Nancy Diuguid's life, as she fought breast cancer. Woven into Nancy's personal story are insights from US scientist and ecologist Rachel Carson, whose seminal book, 'Silent Spring' exposed the health dangers of pesticides as far back 1962. The film pays tribute to Nancy, a visionary director and actor, who used the creative arts and her own lesbian identity as a lifelong campaign for justice and healing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bPz7sFG4wwv5TtYzjETdkyI0z2F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance Me to the End of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
