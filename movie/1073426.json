It is also a personal story about the narrator's traumas and memories, her love affair and one-time crush, God, drugs, missing her mother, and violence and abuse.  Director Michele Mwikali Lauritsen deftly employs crackling prose to position her film in the impossible—and refreshing—position between the gallery-smart contemporary art of the time and a more accessible and popular format.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8waQthRXRIxwSuV12kq0ekABaq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190411,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Love Factory House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2014-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"- a film about identity and searching for meaning in life","title":"80000 Thoughts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
