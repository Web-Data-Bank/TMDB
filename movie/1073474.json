Donning theatrical face-paint and a wig, Labat transforms himself into an icon of Babalu, the Afro-Cuban folk god. His use of Babalu as a cultural metaphor is steeped in irony; to millions of Americans, Babalu is the theme song of Cuban bandleader Ricky Ricardo on TV's I Love Lucy. In other sequences, Labat deconstructs the stereotypical gestures and objects — macho posturing, jai alai, maracas — that are used by the media to signify \"Latin culture.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babalu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
