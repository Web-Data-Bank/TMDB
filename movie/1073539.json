A broken pair of sunglasses, small notebooks, a volunteer work journal – a mix of personal effects and junk is revealed piece by piece, sketching out their owner, a child from the 1940s. What can objects tell us about the past and what are the limits of that knowledge?  The film is an outline of a new form merging art and scholarship, focusing on the history of material culture, our notion of history and on the ways we use the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Study the Stars Tonight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
