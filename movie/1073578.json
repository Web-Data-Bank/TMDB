The deadly HIV/AIDS pandemic was devastating the gay community, and with no cure, no vaccine and no treatment in sight, gay men had to watch helplessly while a generation of precious human beings was lost. Despite the horror of these deaths, the dominant feelings in straight society were indifference and contempt. Despite all this, David Shannon, a real gay man, was moved to help out as best he could. Many HIV/AIDS patients were completely abandoned by family and friends and left to die alone. David would sit with these ostracized men, and while he couldn't cure their illness he could at least comfort them and keep them company in their final. David never talked about it; his friends only found out after he passed away in 2018. This film encapsulates David's silent crusade, portraying him caring for one fictional patient as he dies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mCl3EXynIr7Yy1LyaMYJ5EwlPSf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
