In this process, Muslims who were forced to become Christians but continued to live their faith in secret would be called Morisco, and now Andalusian Muslims will be called Morisco.  While the forced conversion continued with all its violence, the inquisition courts stepped in. The Moriscos, who were suspected of being secret Muslims, were tried and burned at the inquisition.  However, the Spanish forces, the largest empire of the time, suppressed this rebellion in a very bloody way. There was a massacre, especially in the Galera region, where civilians took refuge. There are still places where Muslims took refuge in this region. The places where the massacre and the rebellion took place in the gallery are included in the documentary with all its details.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o6uPfSNxEW7EGejPeKpqurU6jrG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell Andalusia..
