Nine days earlier they buried his wife, grandma: at that time too these 3 men walked like this next to each other, behind her coffin. They pass a long wall in an old oak wood until they reach the open field again. The spectator can tune in to their conversation. The old man has a lot of memories; the young men look ahead. It is obvious that their patterns of life are different but they complement each other, their lives are interwoven. Their connection and friendship are conveyed by the humour and lightness of their conversation. They each have their own pace; they don’t walk synchronously; none of them sets the rhythm, the dynamics occur naturally through their kinship. That ancient chemistry holds these three men together as allies, surrounded by an invisible magnetic field, as they journey through the forest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4mxA383wqs7DPFad6ApwebHgHoQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rather Cold Today","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
