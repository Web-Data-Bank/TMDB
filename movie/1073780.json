A woman walking through 3 video images. Three screens display how the dayâ€™s light passes by: from the early morning light until late at night. Along with the woman the artist walks through the forest, in the same rhythm, the same pace. Off-screen she looks through the camera, fragmenting time. The age-old androgynous trees are a vertical constant along which the woman moves, as if in an interval between visibility and invisibility, between sound and silence, while the light keeps on evolving metabletically.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e0ME4VgM1a4Q8syq6N5MDdmzLzS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":15}
