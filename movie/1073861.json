How will that affect her chances for marriage and employment? The world is nothing but worries. Should she lose weight or get surgery to shave her bones down to look more petite? Or maybe even replace all of teeth like TV celebrities do? In response to these appalling questions, she must explain herself earnestly and painfully, yet she refuses to give up on her body so easily. In a society where a woman’s life is determined by her body, perhaps she feels that it is only when she treasures her body that she may attain happiness. One of the shorts in the omnibus animated film If You Were Me: Anima Vision produced by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea.
