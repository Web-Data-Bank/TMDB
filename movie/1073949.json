Sky on Skin","overview":"Video performance through 4 seasons, 2005. The artist infiltrates nature four times. Nature flews through her veins and nestles under her skin. The color on her skin evolves with the 4 seasons we have in Belgium: winter, spring, summer, autumn. The blue hue that predominates in the sky at that particular moment in the circle of the year is condensed on the artist's skin. Marie Julia Bollans√©e uses 4 blue pigments: cobalt in winter, ceruleum in spring, indigo in summer and ultramarine in autumn. The Impressionists studied the same setting in different lights or different seasons. They looked at it with their eyes and painted it. Marie Julia Bollansee goes into nature, into the same small biotope several times of the year-circle. And she becomes nature for a while.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5UEwpW4he0baBa2QqR0iteM3uXi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S.O.S.
