The group of social misfits and restless searchers have one thing in common: they are out of step with their surroundings and desperate for change. Among them: a husband and wife, four years into their marriage and simmering in boredom; a single mother and her young son, who is showing disturbing signs of mental instability; a peculiar woman with few if any friends and only her menial job keeping her grounded; a figure model, comfortable in his body and ready for a creative challenge; a worried grandmother and her adult granddaughter; a hulking laborer and gym nut; a physical therapist; an ex-con. With thrumming unease, the class sinks deeper into their lessons as the process demands increasing devotion. When the line between real life and imagination begins to blur, the groupâ€™s deepest fears and desires are laid bare.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o7ui7QErRRJjdzRGleh62rlYR8H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41077,"logo_path":"/1ZXsGaFPgrgS6ZZGS37AqD5uU12.png","name":"A24","origin_country":"US"},{"id":123620,"logo_path":"/ePRhZ3yb09Ya6WMzCCBYopwIYbE.png","name":"Square Peg","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Acting Class","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
