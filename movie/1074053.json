This programme charts the remarkable success and progress of the world's first turbojet-powered airliner and its evolution into a front-line aircraft of the Royal Air Force. The Nimrod was the world's first land-based pure jet aircraft built for anti-submarine duties and long-range maritime patrol. The Nimrod's ability to detect surface and subsurface movements was outstanding and ensured that even under the waves the enemy had no place to hide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gHhnlWzlh7YIjjuIRS1I0KDBxND.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"History of Aviation: The Nimrod","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
