In the film, which was shot in Sisimiut (Holsteinsborg), a group of Greenlandic women talk about their work and their position in the workplace, about the need to organize themselves, to stand shoulder to shoulder in order to improve working conditions and wages. The women, working as shrimp pillers, tell with bitterness, but also humor, about their lives and the double work that they have to endure. The 'royal' hand-picked Greenlandic prawns are viewed here in relation to the repeated abdominal infections the women suffer from, and their political struggle related to labor and gender.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oV2G4lew1Mc8MqqAn6Dn7sVORx9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women Workers in Greenland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
