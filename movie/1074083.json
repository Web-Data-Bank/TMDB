Did the Catholic Church conspire to eradicate the Holy Bloodline from existence? To some, Mary Magdalene was the wife or consort of Jesus Christ. The infamous Da Vinci Code has firmly placed this idea into the popular arena along with the idea of a Holy Bloodline descended from Jesus and Mary. In this unique film we journey to places never before researched in connection with this story. We venture into the heart of ancient Lincoln, England, and uncover a tale so mysterious, so at odds with the accepted norm, that we are forced to question everything we previously held to be true.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Murder of Mary Magdalene","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
