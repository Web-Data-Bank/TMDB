Dashi Namdakov, a descant of darkhans, began to learn the craft not long after a Buryat shaman cured him of a life-threatening illness as a young man. Today he is internationally celebrated as an artist and sculptor. Namdakov carries on his ancestors' ways, working with fire and metal to create art that conveys a Buddhist-shamanic spirituality and a distinct flavor of the supernatural. This 2019 film by Kazakh director Gulshat Omarova offers a glimpse into Namdakov's fascinating life and the creative process that honors his Buryat roots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blacksmith","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
