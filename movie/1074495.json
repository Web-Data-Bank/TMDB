The documentary was birthed out of British-Nigerian DJ Juba's pursuit for new perspectives in the gender debate.  This curiosity led her to Nigeria, where she connected with three DJs: Sensei Lo, DJ Yin, and DJ Ayizan in order to get an insight into their experiences in the context of Lagos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assurance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
