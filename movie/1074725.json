How many people know this singular and important aspect of the great Milanese actor's life? \"Forgotten Activism\" attempts to reconstruct a particular profile of the actor Gian Maria Volonté, the one concerning his political commitment, an aspect that is often neglected and ignored. A life spent on acting, but at the same time on politics, with the fixed idea of always wanting to change things and have his say, denouncing the abuses of power - as in the case of the anarchist Pinelli - and social inequalities. A character that can be defined to all intents and purposes as a fighter, a 'revolutionary in an actor's uniform', who exposed himself without trying to mediate his positions, sometimes extreme and as a true outsider.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jJSy7vqBlfOzSNCkw0ahsTw1P7O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159429,"logo_path":null,"name":"AAMOD - Archivio Audiovisivo del Movimento Operaio e Democratico","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgotten Activism","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
