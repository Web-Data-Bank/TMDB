Before her, film crews on the trail of the sailors who, in 1940, joined De Gaulle in England, had bored the islanders. The filmmaker found herself in a position of incrustee, in a state of non-communication bordering on exclusion. Unable to obtain anything from the inhabitants, but nevertheless involved in the environment of granite and mutism of the people, she filmed herself as a \"wanderer not integrated\" in an island, whose tendency to fossilization she thus reveals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Île à ma dérive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
