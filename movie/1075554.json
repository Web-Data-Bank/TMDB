Toraji (Ozawa Kazuyoshi), who rebelled against this dictatorship but was unsuccessfully insulated and expelled, is picked up by his uncle Ryuzo and joins the Takematsu Rengokai. Toraji recruits a group of local delinquents headed by Hiroshi Maeda (Yasukaze Motomiya) into his ranks and begins a guerrilla war against the Kanto Rikukai-affiliated Yoshinin-kai. The two expand their power, but Toraji begins to dabble in stimulants and gradually goes berserk.
