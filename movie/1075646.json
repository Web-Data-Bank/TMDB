For this, Sébastien Roubinet has invented a strange little boat \"TiBabouche\" capable of sailing on sea and on ice. This boat is a prototype brimming with technology and science, made-up by Hervé Le Goff, a CNRS engineer. It will allow Hervé to calibrate the satellite “Cryosat”, the first one capable of measuring the thickness of ice.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/2wSGIowoy8lu3n5BJJFoiR4nLu9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106009,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Cinquième Rêve","origin_country":""},{"id":28968,"logo_path":"/f7Xz8CyAzM2t2srVhfPJ72QO5G5.png","name":"MFP","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sailing the North Pole","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
