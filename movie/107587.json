Soon, he begins to sell airtime to the various locals, who broadcast their own personal love dedications and (more frequently) insults for all to hear. A subplot evolves between Abelardo (the stranger), Celeste (a young woman who is chained inside her father's house to stop her running away), and José (a young man).","popularity":0.731,"poster_path":"/pDrflEA0HGDWlBTWZvAWqp79wL1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pegaso Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"1999-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Day Silence Died","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":13}
