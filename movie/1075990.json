My film takes the position that everyone is ultimately responsible for him or herself, and women, just as men, can be the cause of a relationship's breakup. The film's structure is similar to a television commercial, but unlike a commercial, the actor sells a point of view rather than a product.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Colored Men Who've Had Enuf!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
