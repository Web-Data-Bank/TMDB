Inspired by War of the Worlds and B Creature features from the late 1950s. We worked without a crew so everyone involved did several jobs. Brandon directed, operated the camera, edited, sound designed and did voice over work. Ama directed, wrote, designed the lighting, costuming, operated the fog machine, fire fx, blood, and the tentacles! Which we also made as well! Jared and Mark did voice over characters as well as performing on camera. Rozi did her own stunts, helped with make up and costuming and Amber helped with set design as well as being on camera! It was a little project made for fun in a time when we need it the most! We hope you enjoy and happy halloween!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pzOHLaEmtVbn0I1yYqMGJBN9RaQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176462,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Midnight Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terror from 20,000 Leagues Below","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
