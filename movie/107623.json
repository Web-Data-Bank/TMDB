The 'torture' comes to look increasingly like strenuous kung fu training with Kao putting the prisoners through their paces. The Qing governor and his aides become suspicious of Kao's motives, although the beautiful Princess Shao Lung develops her own ideas about him.","popularity":1.658,"poster_path":"/nOazqRGdagQejQe3BFUCJZXtD3l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bang!
