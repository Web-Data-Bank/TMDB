The tour was not a billed specifically to promote his new album, but was more about Michael singing covers of his favourite songs, mixed with a smattering of new and more recent tracks, and a selection of oldies. On 27th January 91, George performed at the second Rock In Rio Festival in Brazil's second city, where he gave one of the tour's very finest performances. The show included an unexpected appearance from George's old Wham! partner, Andrew Ridgely, for a three-track encore to conclude the concert which included 1991 versions of Careless Whisper, I'm Your Man and Freedom. Recorded for live TV and Radio Broadcast, the full concert has never before been released.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3h6YqyxegzFspgPaFsOQLe5Tir6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George Michael: Rock in Rio II","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
