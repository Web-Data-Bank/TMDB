The band first teased the event yesterday, posting a picture tagged at Chapel Off Chapel with the caption, “It’s a glorious day in Melbourne and we’ve got something exciting to finally announce tomorrow!!!”  The wonderful and intimate Prahran venue played host to the brothers earlier in the year, when they recorded the set between lockdowns.  The livestream will feature singles from their recently released sophomore album Into The Great Unknown, which received strong reviews. The duo were joined by a full audience, keys, and string section for the very first time live.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gamWHDETYxAt9sHZ3yT61vcgn5r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pierce Brothers - Live at Chapel Off Chapel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
