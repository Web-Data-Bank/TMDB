The internationally-loved pop hitmakers helped cement the foundation of the early 80's pop-rock sound without the aid of outside composers, session players or, most importantly, creative compromise. From their very first show, The Go-Go's sang and played their own songs, offering five feisty role models for a generation of ready-to-rock girls and good, hooky fun for pop-loving guys. Nothing But Videos celebrates The Go-Go's with a special episode highlighting some of the band’s most iconic hits including “We Got The Beat”, “Our Lips Are Sealed” and their newest single “Club Zero”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24606,"logo_path":null,"name":"AXS TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Go-Go's: Nothing But Videos","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
