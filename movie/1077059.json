Four years on from his diagnosis, Davy decided to ride the ‘High 5’, taking on five of the UK’s highest roads in one single ride. Sharing the road with his two brothers and a few close friends, we followed their 260-mile ride across the Scottish highlands in their journey to prove everyone wrong. We worked with Robbie Lawrence, the photographer, director and frequent Rapha collaborator, to tell this part of Davy’s story in a short film.  “Whilst the dexterity and details of life are beginning to escape me, cycling has been different… I’m still full of life, full of fire and capable of something amazing.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Davy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
