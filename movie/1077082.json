Luciano, a tourist guide to the Ch√¢ da Caldeiras volcano, will be our guide. He has never left Fogo Island, and confides to us how he needs to get out of there. His daily chores: walk up the volcano, take care of his grapes and feed the cattle. In his spare time he accompanies his father, on the violin, with his Reco-Reco, a plain comb he scrapes a plastic tube with. The trip he invites us to take with him will also be his tour, an initiation journey in the heart of his country and culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24731,"logo_path":"/vwQj2DPMJWBlgKC2Ek6h4aOe5AQ.png","name":"Les Films Grain de Sable","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Som & Morabeza","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
