It is a study of emerging and transforming mathematical equations. These effects were created using an interactive process of \"artificial evolution.\" The artist and computer collaborate to produce images and movements that neither could easily produce alone. The computer generates and displays a collection of experimental abstract images. The artist chooses the most aesthetically interesting images, and those survive and are \"bred\" to produce a new collection of images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":191500,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thinking Machines Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":191534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Target Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primordial Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
