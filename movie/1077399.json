The three live in a modest house of the outskirts in Barcelona, and nothing makes them suspect that their quiet life is about to change dramatically. Lola has entered an advanced Alzheimer's process and children, who are not willing to separate them and end up in a host place, will take care of her with great ingenuity and overflowing fantasy, hiding her disease. For this they will have to face, like Robert in their athletics competitions, more than 3,000 obstacles.","popularity":0.849,"poster_path":"/2D0jsfO8t2axzcmL9mNJzyqjBHh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191591,"logo_path":null,"name":"3000 obstáculos A.I.E.","origin_country":""},{"id":10054,"logo_path":null,"name":"Irusoin","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":118930,"logo_path":"/lRBrUE7HoGl1BzPLmLIbnBIYbi3.png","name":"Vilaüt Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loli Tormenta","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
