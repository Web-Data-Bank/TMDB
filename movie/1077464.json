The imaginative production, by Jean Bellorini, was seen at the Opéra de Lille in Autumn 2018, and the cast features soprano Jeanine De Bique in the title role, countertenor Tim Mead as her husband Bertarido and another countertenor, Erato’s rising star Jakub Józef Orliński as Unulfo. Reviewing the production, Le Monde noted Emmanuelle Haïm’s “intimate connection with this music, which she knows how to unleash in all its violence, passion and heart-wrenching expressivity.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7eJHNS2slNGq54N9zyfNwcKfzz2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra de Lille","origin_country":""},{"id":121165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ozango","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":25564,"logo_path":"/hOMyGLs7mSWoDzVkGDYgK0BdVo6.png","name":"Mezzo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rodelinda","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
