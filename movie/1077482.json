Like, serious enough to get out amongst the jagger bushes and mosquitos in a loin cloth of all things.  You ever pore over that old Monster Manual and have a Hook Horror LJN figure? Then you’re going to get this. Maybe you’d like to see ladies in Renaissance Faire garb sword fight one another in the hometown of William Burroughs, possibly behind a mall? Do you like dialogue like, “Do mine eyes deceive me or is it Shan-Ra?” And people bowing and saying, “My lady, I beseech you for protection?”  This is that movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96015,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abraxas Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song of the Sword","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
