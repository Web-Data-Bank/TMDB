From the temples of Laos, alongside with teenage monks, we will accompany a soul in its transit from one body to another through the bardo. The words of the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" will be our guide to avoid getting lost in the afterlife. A luminous and sonorous journey that will lead us to reincarnate on the beaches of Zanzibar, where groups of women work in seaweed farms.","popularity":2.032,"poster_path":"/6FORElzqPbqviMbrHgH5RNcWWnJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187969,"logo_path":"/Urg2aTxtxxk7Xbul8LfUSKeSdS.png","name":"Señor y Señora","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lao","iso_639_1":"lo","name":""},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samsara","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
