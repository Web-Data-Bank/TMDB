In this documentary, the director wants them to interrogate him as agents of the Islamic Republic might. He would like the real torturer in Iran to see himself through the film as if in a mirror. The violent experience of putting themselves in the torturer's head confronts them with their own limits and the ambivalence of the project itself.","popularity":1.086,"poster_path":"/dkjcselnLriF2gHwwoyLlGFDnP6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127455,"logo_path":"/g43BiHeXJvFibvuLFVT4zmpmYd9.png","name":"l’atelier documentaire","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6003,"logo_path":"/mEswQx1seYJjA2knd0lrdDGvxvu.png","name":"Box Productions","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Worst Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
