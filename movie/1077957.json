You get together with your co-workers to devise a plan to turn the tables and stick it to him just as hard and deep as he's stuck it to the office for years! Jake (Pierce Paris) has had enough of his boss Mr. Hart's (Dean Phoenix) sexual games. He arranges to meet with two other victims - Rod and Victor (Max Adonis and Remy Cruze) - and persuade them to join to pay him back for what he's done to all of them. As they tell their stories we meet another victim, Cole (Woody Fox) and the boss' accomplice assistant Darren (Damon Heart), but the key to everything may just be the boss' wife Missy (Nina Hartley). Will their plan go off without a hitch or will they find themselves in more trouble when they try Breaking Mr. Hart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jNn4EVd7dkq0bC0zutjBI1kGh5D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78809,"logo_path":"/1HSXh5TFQbirsG9V9lgggH2nHDK.png","name":"NakedSword","origin_country":"US"},{"id":150597,"logo_path":null,"name":"NakedSword Originals","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breaking Mr. Hart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
