Erik Bergqvist is a young documentary filmmaker who is eager to tell the truth and create a martyr and a symbol out of his subject. The film is a satirical look at the documentary genre and how a narrative perspective and subjects can be used and misinterpreted for a larger goal. It´s a callback to the old swedish docudramas Stockholmsnatt and They Call Us Misfits about troubled teenage men in Stockholm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dokument: Blixten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
