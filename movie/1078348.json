Although this movie by Direk Reyno is daring and full of sensuality, he still managed to be artistic, especially the delicate scene of Mr. International Philippines candidates Andrew Lucas and Kate Denise. Both go all-out in their intimate scenes, especially the new actor Andrew, who is bold, daring, and wild in the movie.
