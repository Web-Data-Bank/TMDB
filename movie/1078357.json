Putting snowmobiles and 4x4s to shame, the crew traveled across the Northwest through Idaho, Washington and Oregon in a bikecar. A bikecar? One may ask. Yes, a four person pedal powered vehicle was the vessel of adventure this season. Pulling a trailer with snowboards and gear, the crew pedaled in search of snow. Documenting all the trials and tribulations of this trip was filmmaker Joey Fountain, formerly of Robot Food. Bikecar is a one of a kind documentary, which brings a new perspective to travel, adventure and snowboarding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8CbhIPHrmP7RIAZNT3nrk7TRUvd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bikecar","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
