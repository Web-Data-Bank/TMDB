Is he the ‘pure fool, enlightened by compassion’, who, it has been prophesied, will purify the realm?  OperaVision is live from Bergen for a concert staging of Parsifal, Richard Wagner’s final music drama which is unlike anything that went before or has come since. It can feel more like a ritual ceremony than an opera – grand yet intimate, somehow occupying its own space and time. At the heart of Parsifal is a curious, magical treatment of the symphony orchestra that appears to give the voices above it all the space and autonomy they need.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xbbVmQdJxeAFuadrJ1PhiVcq6JZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parsifal - PBO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
