By training a neural network on filmed footage this network learnt to construct a virtual body that can be controlled by feeding it new reference movements. The first act 'Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)’ satirizes the idea that an AI is something that we might mistake for a human. Through drag performance, we aim to use cabaret and musical theatre to challenge narratives surrounding A.I. and society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zqzXwPbh9KQPcc4eA9x5wv5uDlF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zizi & Me - Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
