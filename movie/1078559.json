During an immigration raid, she escapes to an elderly Malay stranger's apartment. While waiting for the raid to end, the stranger mistakes Hanh as if she was his daughter who left home. Hanh plays along like she is in a home she longs for, as if they are a family. However, such impressions only last until her return to the apartments after the raid, she realises the people and places she once felt like family and home, have always been seeing her differently. Needing to belong somewhere, Hanh decides to leave with her increasingly stranger daughter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":127833,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afternoon Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":76586,"logo_path":"/8IToSMttTBtO40fWsxSd1HES4cS.png","name":"Akanga Film Asia","origin_country":"SG"},{"id":125306,"logo_path":"/5APg5O1oWCAn2CALjmdSvKNkCnh.png","name":"La Fabrica Nocturna Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":191859,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Commonist","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Oasis Of Now","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
