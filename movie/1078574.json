A legend himself, there’s not a lot of pioneers of roots and reggae that he didn’t work with, becoming the go-to producer for that dub sound coming out of Jamaica in the sixties and seventies, further cementing his legacy when he started licensing his productions straight to London labels. Diggory Kenrick’s doco calls on not only Lee himself to tell the story, but features the likes of U Roy, Dennis Alcapone, Lee “Scratch” Perry, Sly and Robbie, Johnny Clarke and Johnny Holt among others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yd3BY2kcbnNSIR8w5J6xzkucP69.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191864,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gorgon Films","origin_country":""},{"id":191865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Newborn Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":191866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jamaican Recordings","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A larger than life close up look at the incredible career of the legendary Jamaican record producer, and the real roots of reggae music by the people who made it happen.","title":"I Am the Gorgon: Bunny 'Striker' Lee and the Roots of Reggae","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
