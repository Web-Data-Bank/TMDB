One is a world of Balkan countries where professionals are negligent, stubborn and unreliable. The other is a world of “unbearable routine and pose of the Borganism of the European administration”. Those who receive European money can hardly cope with the administrative obligations required of them. Those on the other side cannot stand the casual attitude of the beneficiaries. What is it that the EU really wants us to change so that we can become the part of the “European family”? This film answers this question through a moving personal story. It’s the personal story of all of us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fzxbdNYDS13wm1QmAevmh7clLdj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2022-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Do You Define Arrogance?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
