The movie uses old archival footage of the performances of the bards of this type of music, highlighting important aspects of Macedonian music traditions for future generations. In parallel with historical coverage, the film follows the creation and development of new music bands in Macedonia, representing the survival of this musical style in today’s context.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6hl28g9HathcRlhqmNOgHYsQwWV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Award Film \u0026 Video","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":66158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quasar Film","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keif (Macedonian Chalgia Tradition)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
