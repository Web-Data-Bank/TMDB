His most famous painting, \"The Scream\", painted in 1893, has become the symbol of existential anguish. He obsessively sought to express his most violent emotions in the face of death and love, bringing them together in a great whole, the \"Frieze of Life\". Nature, in perpetual movement, the bearer of vital momentum, helped him to exalt his anguish of living through its colors and undulating lines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edvard Munch: Un cri dans la nature","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
