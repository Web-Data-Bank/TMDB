Invariably discovered through the process of industrial peat extraction, these bodies become an evocative lens through which to explore our current era of human-induced planetary change.  With a script by novelist Daisy Hildyard, the film traverses 300 million years of history across its three sequences, during which the revenant figure of The Bog Body returns to the surface of a world on the brink of ecological collapse. Brought to life through an innovative mix of practical puppetry effects and animatronics, The Bog Body urges its human discoverer to open their eyes; to learn from the many worlds that have gone before or face inevitable extinction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m3LAV793gkmvGvz4LZBewTxtrZ0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black River of Herself","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
