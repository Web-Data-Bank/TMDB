In spite of that, there's still hope for a change. Embarked on a journey in the Caimpugan Peatland, unmasking drawbacks and raising awareness (kamalayan).  To start with, our objective is to show the detrimental effects of the destruction of Peatlands specifically in Caimpugan Peatlands on Agusan del Sur. We immersed ourselves in the field to discover the dilemmas our locals face and gathered as much information as possible to put together an eye-opener film.  Having a glimpse of their reality, we concluded a solution that makes sense. Having little to no information about Peatlands only leads to more human interventions. In order to call for action it is necessary to address the subject matter. In the hopes of mitigating climate change, we must first raise awareness among the mass.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Dm8PuWhiQpPM2pwGZsNRrsmMEw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Semper Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Awareness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
