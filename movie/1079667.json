In fact, a journey that is not over in their lives. Jarda Icon teaches classes on how women can obtain their own orgasm. With her group of disciples and friends Ana Brasil, Sheyla Fernanda, Caroline Sylvie and Lakshmi she develops self-sustainable feminist and artistic projects. The film is political, but not at all politicized in the traditional sense. It is an ode to the underground and counterculture movements, it is a hymn to freedom, and its title is also a tribute to Oswald d Andrade, one of the main names in Brazilian modernism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mkHjKGvWvO34eTLMUGaOoju3EcN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107882,"logo_path":"/b2WGUyLfT3YOOmvqfJRqaLkxpJh.png","name":"Mercúrio Produções","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2023-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joy Is the Acid Test","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
