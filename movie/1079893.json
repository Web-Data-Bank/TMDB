Over the past 15 years, a new generation of international historians has been digging into the truth of how deeply the Third Reich’s women were involved in the atrocities.  Combining their fresh analyses with striking archival footage, this film reveals previously unknown stories about the women who refused to live in the shadow of Nazi men.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/igmAsKwwaHCZAGoyiZWggBEDKJy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":115437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hauteville Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women Under Hitler's Flag","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
