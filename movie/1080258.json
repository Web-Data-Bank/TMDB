His music is composed intuitively and at the same time it is highly abstract. Without clear directionality and at the same time not without form. For a Japanese  audience it sounds “Western” and in the West it is regarded “Japanese”. A music in between categories. Like Kondo’s music the film is shifting between places and directions: a concert in the Muziekgebouw in Amsterdam, an elaborate sushi bar in Tokyo, a CD-production in a Cologne radio station, the Zuisenji temple in Kondo’s neighborhood in Kamakura.  Kondo wants his music to appear “normal”, without spectacular surface or narrative elements. A concept of “normality” you may also find in the films of Japanese filmmaker  Yasujiro Ozu, who – like Kondo – spent most of his life in Kamakura.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ogY57mhmktZyFsLT0cz23ZMbhgE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viola Rusche \u0026 Hauke Harder","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Shape of Time - the composer Jo Kondo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
