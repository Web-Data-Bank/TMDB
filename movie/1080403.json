Detroit, a northern American post-industrial city. Meet Ade Mainor, aka “Mr DE”, Afro-american music producer. Living in one of the poorest and most dangerous urban environments in the country, Mr DE clings to the ambition of running a cultural and business enterprise inspired by the legendary Tamla Motown Label. He wants to give young musicians the chance to live from their music rather than stooping to crime. Mr DE - A Detroit Story, is a look at an urban culture with a painful past and an uncertain future, but where a glimmer of hope still persists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qqXwlYkTxVVOzKpmT21sYKbaHfy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Submerge Recordings","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr De, A Detroit Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
