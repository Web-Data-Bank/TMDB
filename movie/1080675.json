Across the hall is Doris Golden, a reporter on the Evening Star, who enthuses over the work of both. Mark's novel is sold and Hugh and Doris see a new Mark. Mark begs Hugh to allow him to stake him until his pictures sell, but pleasure in his new clothes and new popularity dwindle as he sees his old friends will not profit by them. A happy idea strikes him and he buys all of Hugh's paintings on exhibition at a local dealer, requesting that his name be not mentioned.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jHyZxwoGIralPH9KIitYWipeqfl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peerless Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Square Deal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
