He and a diverse group of unconventional preachers then began to spark the most important awakening in the history of the Christian Church — through the most unlikely means – by casting out demons. This fiery film documents the beginnings of their journey. “Come Out In Jesus Name” will be followed by a live simulcast event where Pastor Locke and his fellow demon slayers will lead a supernatural mass deliverance... in Jesus name.","popularity":1.404,"poster_path":"/6477EtUdjnPt48CTWF6P6MDTYRX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Locke Media","origin_country":""},{"id":192335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Studio Group","origin_country":""},{"id":192336,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neon World Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The most important awakening in church history has begun","title":"Come Out in Jesus Name","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
