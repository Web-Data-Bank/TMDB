With such, we propose a new constellation of technologies through a narration on vulnerability. Tools to destroy and disappear, but also to expand and nourish.  A homage to the symbolic link in a drop of water and a late-night DM; a soaked jacket coming back home and trying to resuscitate a phone in rice.  The film was created through a back-to-back dialogue between \"makers\". Itâ€™s a research on writing and filming, and simultaneously on affection and subjectivity. It was filmed in Super-8 and 16mm film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Might Go and Throw My Phone Into The Lake, Yeah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
