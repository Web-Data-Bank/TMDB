In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has declared QAnon a potential domestic terrorism threat. For one family, QAnon has caused division so severe that they had to report their relative - Tim Stewart, a QAnon conspiracy theorist - to Australia's national security hotline. In a concerning twist, it emerged that Stewart has had a longstanding friendship with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison - leading to speculation about QAnon and Australia's highest ranks of political power. A look at the alarming movement which has caused ripples through the world, through the eyes of one family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xWbKR1tG5dOwgfkEzDjypGjoZa6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32645,"logo_path":"/voB1FAfKtxxhFbVT93hVJcNO28z.png","name":"Plan√®te+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Awakening: QAnon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
