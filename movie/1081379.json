Pete Namlook is a purist. He never wanted to release a video with grinning musicians fuzzing around with their instruments or 3D animation which has not the timeless quality. More Important is the direct connection to the music. Visuals not as an explanation of the sound but more an enhancement and intensification of the overall musical experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Putney","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
