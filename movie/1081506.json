It is a continuing work-in-progress, and this version ends with 2016. Dozens of apologies are collected every year, and they will be added as time permits.  The passage of time does not heal all wounds; it cannot settle all accounts or resolve all disputes. But the identities of the perceived perpetrators can change, and a national apology’s task is to document, to put on record, a symbolic act as a prelude to possible reconciliation and forgiveness. To achieve these ends, one’s sincerity is paramount, especially when reading from a script.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l5RqQPIb9BfJbWuNEWIl7mstMMQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apologies v2016.2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
