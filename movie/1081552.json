The drama centres on a woman who has burned out and who holds up her own despair – and her attempts to rebuild her life – as a mirror to the rest of us. With a blend of gravity and humour, Sylvie Groulx's film shows the absurdity of a society dedicated to the cult of speed at all costs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vELui4MDAjzJLQ6YPkXj9tE0Jcu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hasty Man Drinks His Tea with a Fork","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
