Inspired by this incident, “Code of Silence” sheds light on the esprit de corps, here using the example of a German police duo. While pursuing a suspect, police officer Thomas loses his service weapon in a scuffle with the fleeing suspect. His partner, and long-standing friend, Grebe sees no other way than to shoot at the suspect and kill him. Thomas is not entirely convinced that Grebe’s actions were right, and now has to decide whether his moral obligation is to truth or to loyalty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/54jyp9UHuJfZ1Nh5dpliw6NOpGK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Code of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
