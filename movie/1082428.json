Darkly comic and deeply compelling The Poltergeist is “a tour-de-force performance from Joseph Potter” (Theatre Weekly) as Sasha.  At fifteen Sasha was called an art world prodigy. Celebrities wanted to buy his paintings. His first exhibition was going to make him a superstar.  But now he lives in a run-down flat, with his out-of-work boyfriend, and no one’s even heard of him...What went wrong?  This one-man show is about art, family, memory, and being haunted by the life we never lived.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6eRofCqgryDIYFXza5IhOvbDlzR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flying Colours","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Poltergeist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
