Evin's door. With the inspiration of his young son, Danny, Troy tries to make a movie about the difficulties in making a film for $7,000. Along the way, we see a lot: A negligent, but loving father exposing his child to certain things, two transplanted New York Buddy's breaking each other's balls trying to figure it out, a bizarre love triangle, a couple of the lamest star cameos (but don't tell the \"stars\" I said that) what we don't see is the making of a movie. Rather, the ups and downs of this hilarious eclectic bunch as they try and create their big break.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4tcFRe94Y44IVlPvlkteTzyRnYG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking the Walk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
