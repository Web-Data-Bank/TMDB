The film “imports” an actual building, Lotte World Tower, into a 3D space. The windows of the building are erased and covered up, injecting a sense of the strangeness of a pseudo-reality. The accretion of reflections on the building’s glass exterior, including the glass of another building and countless other images, prompts thought concerning where existence takes place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oCYtGZJreLW0jRKDTNpZbKtnHsb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wall Rally Drill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
