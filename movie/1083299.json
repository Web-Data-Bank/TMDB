As so many of the conspiracy theories are absurd, many simple questions about the fatal night of August 31st have never been asked. By the end not only Princess Diana but also Dodi Al Fayed and the driver Henri Paul were dead. First, police blamed the paparazzi for causing the accident. They had been \"buzzing round the car like flies.\" Then 48 hours later they blamed the driver of the Mercedes, Henri Paul. He was said to be three times over the drink limit. This compelling program seeks to answer the many questions overlooked by the enquiry and to uncover what really happened the night Diana died.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/meqwKQ0IyhsMY9xoUyiERaqBFL6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diana: The Night She Died","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
