Fifty years after Japan brought the U.S. into World War II, former adversaries met for the first time in friendship, at a retrospective symposium and air show re-enactment hosted by the Admiral Nimitz Museum. The men who has fought there reviewed the surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and Clark Field in the Philippines, gathering in Texas to show respect and to reminisce about the heroics and fortunes of war. Mixing the aviation images of contemporary artists with interviews and historic footage, this is a unique fiftieth anniversary tribute to the brave patriots on both sides, who fought for their countries and ways of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fMfbeMp8bCQjtnV1ZhpRyuPNvYD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117151,"logo_path":null,"name":"GoodTimes Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Survivors on Both Sides Remember Pearl Harbor...","title":"Memories of War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
