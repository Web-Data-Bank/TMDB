The filmmaker’s cinematic exploration and imaginary archive of her family offers an intimate, nostalgic look into seemingly private memories yet speaks of her own personal cultural values and social histories. In the process, the filmmaker allows herself and her audience inside to see and feel beyond the blurry, fast-paced, and disconnected images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories, Materials, Missing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
