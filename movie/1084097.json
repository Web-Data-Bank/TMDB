In the depressing factory town of the forgotten Eastern Hungary, a movement called Privát Nihil started, which resulted in an amazingly high-quality music world. The focus of the film is the frontman of the band, my father, who embodies genius, but he could not enforce it because of his principles, addictions and demons. Gábor Jesse's strong character created a world, a mini-state, where you can take all your traumas and shout them out. But this roar comes at a price.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h9nciU1ymRwaf7TZZIARsJkpUee.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Control","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
