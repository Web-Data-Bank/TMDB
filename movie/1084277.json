Footage of the house feasts of a Tatar family intertwine with clips evidencing the destruction of the town of Shakhtarsk by the Russian troops in 2014, and with DIY videos made in 2003 by a girl imitating TV-shows. In the interaction with the TV screen the girl performs a fight between herself and Volodymyr Klitchko, followed by a weather forecast that recalls the geopolitical transformation of Ukraine since 2003. The video explores the refugeeâ€™s mental ecosystem, as it rises above interweaving roots of analogue recordings, videos populating social media, and rituals of private memory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hhy67T2DPwhZZtTW80Fm6XZUkPf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weather Forecast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
