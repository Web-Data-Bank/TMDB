Narratives unfold within different temporalities and spaces: documentary footage of the labor inspection in a large company in Minsk that develops military computer games, disappeared content from servers of internet portals, the distributed memory of bodies participating in the revolution, and fictional desired economic strikes. This video can be seen as a playthrough, which one traverses following the threads of the mental exercise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pMQGKlqWGKpfTyAZXBKbQxnizwJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tactical Forgetting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
