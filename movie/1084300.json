One of the worst mass shootings in American history with 49 LGBTQ+ people mowed down on the dancefloor. Pulse, Orlando, 2016. It sent shockwaves around the globe, and triggered the birth of a new group, Gays Against Guns, that brings something new to the gun violence prevention movement. Fearlessness, angry determination, and a creativity not yet seen in this fight. We follow activist royalty Cathy, central to bringing gay mariage to the U.S., and Kevin, an AIDS survivor and true visionary, and John, a gay person of colour who is also a schoolteacher… and drag queen. And we meet survivors. Their deeply moving stories are the heart of this film. This gripping and insightful documentary follows the survivors and the activists over five years, a time of huge social upheaval in America - Trump, the Women’s March, Black Lives Matter, the Capitol riots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mcA9RQcjGhKO7UsmMf73kYkDL66.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gays Against Guns","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
