The film revolves around the journey of a boy from early childhood through adulthood. It highlights the conflicts of growing up in the space between two cultures with radically different customs and values. While this film documents the particular experiences of one child, it is a reflection of a sociological phenomenon common to many Canadian children. Woodbridge is different from most other documentary work primarily because the camera adopts the role of the protagonist. It presents the viewer with a multitude of images/experiences from a purely subjective point of view. The film's immediacy invites the audience to participate in the events directly, as opposed to the usual documentary experience of filmmaker as authority, audience as observer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woodbridge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
