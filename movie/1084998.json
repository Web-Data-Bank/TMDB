It is a 14 minute short film about a guy that finds himself in extraordinary situations and has to take matters into his own hands and put his trust in strangers that under normal circumstances, he never would have met and for sure never talked to. But when people find themselves in a situation and have to ask strangers for help then interesting things happen and we see that we are not so different after all and we should not judge the book by its cover.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8cQxJH8t6SwNl0JO72yAD1lzyGV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saga Film (ICE)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"√çslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Epic Fail","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
