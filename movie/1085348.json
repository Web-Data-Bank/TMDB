His testimony makes us aware of how this history continues to repeat itself; and how the precursors of these massacres and their heirs - now powerful businessmen and politicians - are still responsible for the usurpation of native lands and the violent repression against communities. In the past, it was the mutilation of Selk'nam ears; now, in the midst of the Chilean social rebellion, it is the eyes of the mestizos that are being shot by the police. MariaBasura and other activists decide to take a revenge that will lead them to a small town in Asturias, Spain, birthplace of Jose Menendez Menendez, one of the forefathers of the genocide against the native peoples of the south.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3YviC20X3qM67AOaND1PTQgpbF7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fuck the Fascism: The crossroad of two worlds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
