The title is in Latin and means names are not necessary even pointless. Maybe that was a statement from the director for future films to come. Scenes from a school graduation party mix with shots of soft-drink bottles a conveyor belt. Both the bottles and the students are alike, universal, unoriginal and, above all, nameless. The film was screened at a school anniversary in March 1975 and broadcast on the only television station a few months later.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xaRFCxw7yvZHpLHFof26Oe8HrKj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Menntaskólinn við Tjörnina","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1975-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nomina Sunt Odiosa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
