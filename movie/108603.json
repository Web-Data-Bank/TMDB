Such animals have no choice but to invade human habitats and become man-eaters. This story is inspired by one such attack. A couple vacationing in the Indian jungle are disturbed by the arrival of the wife's ex-lover, opening wounds that are best left unhealed; but their troubles have only begun. They are being hunted by a leopard that's turned man-eater and it will stop at nothing to satisfy its hunger.","popularity":1.743,"poster_path":"/fpOKqXLGuAW04u3bhLfR1qRCM9E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alipur Films","origin_country":""},{"id":177174,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alipur Films India","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forest","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
