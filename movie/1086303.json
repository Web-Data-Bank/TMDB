The idea for a film featuring Hurtado and Mehretu grew out of Dean’s incredible chance discovery, in 2019, that these two artists, both longtime friends of hers, shared the same birthday of November 28—and, moreover, that in 2020, Julie would be turning 50, and Luchita 100.  Filmed over the course of a single day, January 3, 2020, in Hurtado’s Santa Monica apartment, the artists’ conversation meanders through subjects ranging from motherhood, to the environment, to their experiences immigrating to the U.S. as children, and, most movingly, to painting as a way of understanding one’s place in the world.  description adapted from Jennifer King, associate curator of contemporary art at LACMA","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bIAtfCp2B4rKjxN5YqORm99ZXND.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A PORTRAIT IN CELLULOID","title":"One Hundred and Fifty Years of Painting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
