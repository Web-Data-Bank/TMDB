For 33 years, Pale' (Father) Eric Forbes, a Capuchin priest from Guam, has made Chamorro history his passion. Raised by his Chamorro grandmother, he started by listening to the stories passed down to him by his manaina (elders). Collecting photographs, mementos and books as time went by, he began to research in archives in Guam, Saipan, Spain, Italy, Germany, the Philippines, and the United States. He has written books, numerous articles and edited for www.guampedia.com, an online Guam resource site. His work extended to the Chamorro communities in the mainland where he has given Chamorro culture and history workshops. He has a Chamorro resource blog, www.palericblogspot.com. Now he makes this knowledge available in this documentary to inspire people to treasure and keep alive their precious heritage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iGm030g8uqNTtAcVGXKfWPDrml7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bank of Guam and 32nd Guam Legislature","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"33 years. 5 countries.
