Chiseled Tyler Berg (and his impossibly haunting blue grey eyes) stars as a corporate executive who has lost his emotional and spiritual way. The adorably cute (and rambunctious) Ken Summers is the young ward in charge at the exotically ruinous villa where Tyler hopes to (re)connect with himself. Will Ken's increasingly flirtatious prodding break down the walled-off Tyler? Their post-thunderstorm outdoor tryst electrifies this magnificently intimate bareback opus that also features Andy Onassis, Jackson Radiz, and Justin Jett. Shot on location in the stunning picturesque Spanish countryside with all natural light, you will not only feel as if you could inhale its fresh air... you will all-too-quickly long to be there. It's time for you to disconnect and plug into Dis-Connecting.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/wF0o8ceWrhBC5JYiJwFx1Dcxb87.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gay Angel Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dis-Connecting","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
