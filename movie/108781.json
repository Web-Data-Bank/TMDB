In this tranquil setting, three women join the flow of a small community with the subtle presence of a spring breeze. Setsuko , the proprietor of a whiskey-only bar; Takako, the owner of a coffee shop along the waterway; Hatsumi, a maker of tofu so delicious it seems to spring forth from the clear water. Under their subtle influence, other townspeople gradually begin their own streams too: Yamanoha, a local worker for a furniture workshop; Otome, the owner of a neighborhood public bath; Jin, a young man who assists him at the bath; Makoto, a wayfarer about the town. Among their daily lives, there is Poplar, a small child with a perpetually friendly smile.","popularity":1.408,"poster_path":"/e4bKQgGJs3qd9TB960YCXVEwpkp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6755,"logo_path":"/c0ENH8QeZLvCACpzCpwvYMy2SDr.png","name":"Nippon Television Network Corporation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":11725,"logo_path":"/3OZxd70DZ1LbVelmZK8mR5FIXxO.png","name":"VAP","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":70981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradise Cafe","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":62568,"logo_path":"/4J3c6gpvGaqKTsd0FxmsCJWY77e.png","name":"Suurkiitos","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":11846,"logo_path":"/es3LvDA6wLWVDvZnAYYuAT6x8lJ.png","name":"Hakuhodo DY Media Partners","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":11727,"logo_path":"/cIMyE9cw1W4kMFGxmC17HKTnVz9.png","name":"Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":14789,"logo_path":null,"name":"D.N.
