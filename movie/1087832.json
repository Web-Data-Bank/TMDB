The docufiction exposes ancient sardinian “power places” from hystorical, cultural, archeological and energetical points of view crossing over magical and folkloristic local traditions.  It’s a totally digital work, advanced videophotographic techniques for an analogical, unsequential, visionary drive. Mental feedbacks and forseeings, a stream of consciousness. The rich soundtrack, leads often the experience, overwriting the script. Pedra Mendalza is a digital tale with music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2mhKxAO3jvEPeBppqj9AtQs3zlw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a digital tale with music","title":"Pedra Mendalza","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
