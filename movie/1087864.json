This diplomat, in addition to helping save dozens of lives by sheltering persecuted intellectuals and artists, took the risk to stimulate and protect spaces of expression for national artists in the hardest moments of the dictatorship. Having a day-by-day chronology of these three years spent in Chile, Roland Husson accepted from Paris to redo the trip to Santiago. His testimony makes us relive the last hours of the UP.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un diplomático francés en Santiago","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
