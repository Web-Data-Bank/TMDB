From then on, Whangara chiefs, always the first-born, always male, have been considered Paikea's direct descendants. Pai, an 11-year-old girl in a patriarchal New Zealand tribe, believes she is destined to be the new chief. But her grandfather Koro is bound by tradition to pick a male leader. Pai loves Koro more than anyone in the world, but she must fight him and a thousand years of tradition to fulfill her destiny.","popularity":9.855,"poster_path":"/1ZQSkyEDRJdk6TCAThBojB5hJcK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":654,"logo_path":null,"name":"South Pacific Pictures","origin_country":"NZ"},{"id":140,"logo_path":"/ooz5b0ov3PLfBoOJyMmdoffVuHs.png","name":"Pandora Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":16850,"logo_path":null,"name":"ApolloMedia","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2003-01-30","revenue":41400000,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the ways of the ancients she found a hope for the future.","title":"Whale Rider","video":false,"vote_average":7.161,"vote_count":329}
