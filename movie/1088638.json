But the body falters and their environment is getting smaller and smaller. By doing sports, the seniors support each other: origin and social status disappear. The gym fraternizes and gives the elderly unprecedented pleasure. Despite the fanatical sports, the decline is unstoppable. This documentary also shows the seniors alone at home and the confrontational fight against the body that is becoming stiffer, with the realization that that battle is always lost in the long run.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b6bVgODJEc3d7Lj2yS2mPnE046M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96382,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Film Kitchen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blijven Gaan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
