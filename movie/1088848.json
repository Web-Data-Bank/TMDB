And nothing seems to ever threaten the very special relation between a renowned university teacher and one her most gifted student, Alexandra and Corina: two women, two friends who, against the age gap, share the same goals, the same interests. Even the same love interests. Until one day, when the sensibility is stronger than the reason. And all of a sudden, everything that seemed certain, such as friendship, loyalty, love and devotion, turns into a terrible hate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Castel Film cu sprijinul CNC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2004-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Damen tango","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
