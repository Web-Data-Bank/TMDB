A team of engineers from Snap inc. developed algorithms that enabled Christian Marclay to filter and classify millions of videos according to their sound characteristics. The artist thus sequenced more than 400 snaps in order to create a composition based on these everyday, often commonplace, sounds and images. It is played in a loop on ten mobile phones. This montage of hundreds of video excerpts that together produce a music is reminiscent of the work \"Video Quartet\" (2002), which mixes sequences from Hollywood films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Together","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
