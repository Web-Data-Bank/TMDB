Kit’s divorced parents are naturally having a hard time grappling with the reality of their son’s illness, and his father, Lawrence, begins a transition of his own—a conversion to Judaism. Following along with his father’s process of grieving for his son’s upended future, Red Herring captures the absurdity of the things we do to find solace in times of inexplicable tragedy. In this personal and touching documentary about a life cut short, Vincent walks the line between humor and grief to helm this love letter to the relationships that keep us going through the dark stages of life.","popularity":0.854,"poster_path":"/cbAHdDaLXgwL6xFdzBmVsGWqbbs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194132,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bright West Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":110594,"logo_path":"/n6IN6QhMcLyr8zwPRz43lF1Y2Ew.png","name":"Doc Society","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":194134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sundance Institute","origin_country":""},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":186693,"logo_path":"/9FgyMQr7Q80nZq2Lj564tgYthvJ.png","name":"Jewish Story Partners","origin_country":"US"},{"id":194135,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Whickers Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Herring","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
