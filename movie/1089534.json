Allen, struggling to resolve his latest novel, is enticed by Allie to take a powerful psychotropic drug she calls \"the lotus.\" As if a muse were speaking through him, Allen begins recounting the winding story of a young woman's travels decades earlier. Her life in some ways parallels their own, as she journeys into the desert in search of a statue her own deceased mother left her with an old photograph of. The two lives begin to cross over in unexpected ways, and it becomes apparent that a dark secret at the heart of their old home has far broader ramifications than they could have possibly imagined.","popularity":0.632,"poster_path":"/nNFbiD3KvfsWpiC8KGAH5g6jdcM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What happens when the weird refuses to stay buried?","title":"West Coast Gothic","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
