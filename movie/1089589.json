These themes are explored through a movement algorithm that depicts a miniature dystopian society. This society consists of four parties each with a single function - the director, their left-hand man, the guard and the hustler. This all changes when an unplanned event creates a ripple in the structure and pushes its inhabitants to question their role within the society and its functionality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tipping Point","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
