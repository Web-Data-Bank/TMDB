Using expressive images of everyday racism, the film tells the story of a German family with a black mother and a white father who work as theatre actresses and directors - and their process of reflection on the fact that even in a family marked by diversity, subliminal and obvious racism is omnipresent. A call to acknowledge one's own racisms and to question the structural inequality that still persists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wCR8Nx3wl0uo6ii82ywdUjLe5I4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schweigemahl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
