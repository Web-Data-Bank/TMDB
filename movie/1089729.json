By custom prevalent at that time, a girl, once married, could not be divorced or remarried. Heartbroken at the fate of her only child, her mother died after a few years.  Prafulla takes the drastic step to flee in the middle of the night to find the house of her in-laws whom she has never known, without any money, with knowledge of only the name of the village and name of her father-in-law. Benevolent people, surprised to see her traveling alone, help her on the way. This is consistent with the custom in Bengal that all unknown women were to be treated as one's own mother. Her father in law rejects her and tells her to steal for a living. She goes back and through a lot of experiences meets the dacoit head Bhavani Thakur.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ame3xP3ahtLITcmMLYpBumGaRBT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"Bandit queen of Bengal","title":"Devi Chowdhurani","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
