Although they're complete strangers, they make the most of the situation and agree to share the space. Bunny Colby is looking forward to a fun day at the escape room. When her sister-in-law, Serena Blair, shows up, Bunny begins to get nervous. It's not like her husband to be late for an escape room, since they love these games so much... and being around Serena is awkward, to say the least. Officers Angela White and Silvia Saige arrive at a house to take care of a noise complaint. Approaching the front door, they can already hear the music blasting loudly inside. It even takes a few times of knocking before it's finally answered by a woman... who doesn't look concerned at ALL to see them. In fact, she eagerly invites them in.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stuck Indoors Together","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
