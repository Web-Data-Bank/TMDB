Chicago-native Angel Bat Dawid is one of the many talents tracked down by the US label International Anthem. Together with trumpeter Jaimie Branch and drummer Makaya McCraven, Angel Bat Dawid ensures that the \"Windy City\" is on the radar for jazz all over the world.  The musician switches between vocals, clarinet and piano with amazing ease. But apart from that, Angel Bat Dawid is able to breathe a highly spiritual dimension into her music like no other, so that her jazz almost borders on gospel. Listening to the multi-instrumentalist therefore sometimes has something of a transcendental experience, at times reminiscent of the music of Sun Ra.  This concert at Ground Control reveals all the artistic glory of their music. Recording of July 4, 2022 at Ground Control, Paris.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":"/Hrv5h07IO1H1UDOo0rSvv8MYMY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128929,"logo_path":"/pa5yszhj6r1MZSa789M8m7qtWC8.png","name":"Sombrero \u0026 Co","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angel Bat Dawid - Ground Control","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
