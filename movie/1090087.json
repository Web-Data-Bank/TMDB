A study and an improvisational description of the â€œforwardness (of time).\" Initially, it suggests a form of development and passage, but the presence of sound, the glass, and its reflections denote a physical separation in the space, alluding to a \"preservation\" akin to that of a laboratory or an aquarium.  Rather than limiting itself to a binary opposition, the work attempts to discuss a perplexity that exists between what can be controlled and what cannot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vUFELB0pEQQt5NRKIvPJpsvb7B5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time is for what is going to disappear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
