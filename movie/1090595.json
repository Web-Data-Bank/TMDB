The film follows Bernardo's search for a place to stay and his friends' welcome, his routine with health care and with the homonymous play, which he was cast in at the time. The hybrid nature of the film leads us through real images of Bernardo's life; allegorical images made with a microscope; confessional images in video-selfie, where Bernardo deals with his inner demons and images from the play, which dialogue with the moments of the film. Bernardo lives, performs and makes fiction. It's what helps him get through this moment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f0OMOixMFZVA5tgcxu9IHsC2Puj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bird","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
