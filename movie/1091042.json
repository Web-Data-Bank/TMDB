After early success in burlesque and radio, they made their movie debut with supporting roles in One Night in the Tropics and got top billing in their very next film, becoming the nation's #1 boxoffice draw of the '40s. The Andrews Sisters, Dick Powell, Shemp Howard, Martha Raye, Ella Fitzgerald, Jimmy Dorsey, Lucille Ball and Marjorie Main co-star in films like In the Navy, Rio Rita, In Society, Little Giant, and Mexican Hayride. They also go to Hollywood and Venus (not Mars), and meet Frankenstein's Monster, Dracula, the Wolf Man, Boris Karloff, the Invisible Man, Captain Kidd, Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the Keystone Kops, and the Mummy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vodcpaRiMWxQIs11mrW7Yl3T5Io.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmshow","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Take a look at the movie career of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello!","title":"Abbott and Costello in the Movies","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
