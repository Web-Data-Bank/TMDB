He has done this for forty years, ever since the Communist times. Ivan wants to settle down, but that’s not so easy for an old Seagull. He’s got no savings and the pandemic makes things even more difficult: there are no tourists. Ivan supports himself by washing cars and windows. He tries to connect to Russian ladies to help them get visas to the EU and buy property in Bulgaria. He soon understands that he’s not really credible as a serious male companion. Ivan’s real wound is an adult son in Ukraine who refuses to talk to him. Maybe now, in spring 2022, would be the right time to reconnect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gmoS789W51U0eStkdKwYtSghdj8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Seagull","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
