A student and protégé of Freud’s, and one of the most radical figures in the history of psychotherapy, Reich famously claimed to have discovered orgone, a form of life energy pervading the universe. Shot in his home and laboratory in Rangeley, Maine, OR119 transmutes Reich’s writings into song, while also conjuring into existence a series of impossible encounters between Reich and a selection of contemporary feminist writers. A theoretical musical that’s as playful and liberating as it is formally challenging and intellectually provocative, OR119 is suffused with its own unique artistic life force.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x04SSC3yDDa4y8Iy1ZqWc81aJGc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OR119","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
