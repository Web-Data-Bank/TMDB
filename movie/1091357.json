When the war against Ukraine breaks out, it becomes harder for the three young women to leave the vast country in the East, but also even more unbearable to stay. So one has left for Georgia, another for Spain, while the third stays behind in Russia. Their generation does not believe that political engagement changes anything. Instead, they show their resistance by living a modern and more Western life, where gender, sexuality, pop music and identity issues are vital. Set at night in cars, apartments and backyards, Sybilla Tuxen’s dark and artistically uncompromising debut film tells the story of a rebellious yet resigned section of Russian youth on the fringes of established society.","popularity":1.237,"poster_path":"/5t9faFRu2mRuFsdSL9JUV6KVZ7c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119,"logo_path":"/1di2gITGUZr730AMuMKiCrP90Vl.png","name":"DR","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":118,"logo_path":"/AiBorgNTCS1lT1FdFPYheax9jfF.png","name":"Det Danske Filminstitut","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":161580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frau Film","origin_country":""},{"id":135828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danish Arts Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":144243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tambo Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2023-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dark and artistically uncompromising debut film about three young Russian women of the alternative generation who dream of a modern life of freedom but find themselves trapped.","title":"Silent Sun of Russia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
