In a dilapidated former Arctic research station, Creature (Jeffrey Cirio) is unknowingly enlisted by a military brigade into an experimental programme. Creature meets and falls in love with Marie (Erina Takahashi), a cleaner who shows him kindness and compassion; together they dream of escape.  This vivid cinematic experience is a beautiful, tragic tale of an outsider’s search for belonging, the insatiable desires of the powerful, and the enduring hope found in human connection and compassion.","popularity":0.676,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Adaptation of Akram Khan’s ballet of the same name","title":"Creature","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
