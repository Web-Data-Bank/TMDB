But time is short and resources are scarce, and there are rumours in the countryside that a new civil war is brewing. And as if all this wasn’t bad enough, their relationships to their wives are falling apart. ‘Eat Bitter’ mirrors the existential and mundane problems of the two men, while an unlikely friendship and mutual trust blossoms between them. However, the chaotic microcosm of the construction site also mirrors China’s contradictory role in 21st century Africa, with the bank itself as the ultimate symbol of money, power and illusion. Director duo Pascale Appora-Gnekindy and Ningyi Sun themselves represent each of the two cultures, and their film has a unique eye for the human fallibility and irony of it all, but also for how we can reach each other despite all our many differences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pqU7VilNdr0tpvSlfKEOA81DlwR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kea-Kwis Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":196738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oaz Picture Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":196740,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perpetuo Films","origin_country":""},{"id":196741,"logo_path":null,"name":"MJagger","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CF","name":"Central African Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2023-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Sango","iso_639_1":"sg","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A local construction worker and a Chinese engineer are assigned to build a bank in the Central African Republic.
