The body mapping presents a possibility for the character to become potentially anything, with the movement transferring into any kind of digitally constructed body or being through post-production. Based on research of actors performing roles of ‘nonhuman’ characters, the work explores how we approach others in the fiction we produce, and subversively questions what happens when we are under the gaze of the Other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sncw7OoNQD7JpOkVEKdfUxHYSC1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Animal That Therefore I Am","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
