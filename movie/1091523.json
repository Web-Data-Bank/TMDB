Synopsis\r A young man who lives in an attic in a suburb in Thimphu goes about his daily routine – chanting prayers, watering the dying flowers, browsing through social media, and watching men his age play futsal through a small window in his attic. Everything is mundane. Ordinary.  But behind the façade of this ordinariness, he is trapped in the attic – powerless, stagnant and immobile. Outside his attic, life goes on as usual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":194315,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leywang Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dzongkha","iso_639_1":"dz","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"manintheattic shortfilm bhutan","title":"The Man who Lives in the Attic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
