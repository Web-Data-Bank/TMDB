The program had its fair share of sensationalism, but it also had some good food for thought. It covers four broad areas: Masturbation, Removal of pubic hair, Genital piercing and Labiaplasty.  Discussion of each area begins with either a neutral or positive portrayal and then proceeded to give one or more examples of women having had a bad experience which are presented in a “When Dildos Attack” kind of way. Some fun stories, and some make your skin crawl, because it all looks extremely painful.  Contains graphical images of female genitalia, female genital piercing and surgery, strong language and frank talk about women's most private of parts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trouble with My Vagina","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
