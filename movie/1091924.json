The resulting documentary is an intimate portrayal of one of history’s most respected and revered statesmen. Nelson Mandela – The Final Chapter includes never-before seen footage of Mandela’s last ever tour abroad, as well as private meetings and discussions with admirers, celebrities, heads-of-state and ordinary people.
