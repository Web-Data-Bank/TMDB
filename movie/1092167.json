Forty-five years later Mario Salieri, to scandalize the purists of the seventh art, decides to make a reinterpretation of his movie Mamma Roma dedicating it to the adult entertainment industry. After La Ciociara, a movie made in 2018, Salieri's irreverent mission continues. The only connection with Pier Paolo Pasolini's movie is the opening scene of the wedding dinner (part one) and the parental relationship that in Salieri's work reverses the son with the daughter.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/vvcHzymIHDWE1NBQ2cgFV9FUpTb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mario Salieri Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mamma Roma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
