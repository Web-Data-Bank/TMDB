Sigurjón Ólafsson was commisioned for the work, and the film describes the process of the work from the time that he and his assistant, Gudmundur Benediktsson, began the project at Sigurjón's studio until they finally completed it where it stands at the isolated power plant. Sigurjón devised an innovated method for producing the mural. A mould was first cut out in insulating plastic which was then fitted to the concreting construction of the building.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193703,"logo_path":null,"name":"Landsvirkjun","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1989-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story of a Mural","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
