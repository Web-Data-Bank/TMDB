In recent years, technical equipment has been developed which enables much more effective work. Included are seismometers and inclinometers, devices which can detect small changes in land elevation in volcanic areas. A network of such monitors and seismometers is now in use, monitoring for example, Mt. Hekla, Katla and the Krafla volcano as well the main earthquake zone in S-Iceland. There is a new inter-Nordic project which aims at developing forecasts for earthquakes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saga Film (ICE)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watching the Volcanos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
