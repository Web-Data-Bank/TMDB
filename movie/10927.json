But suddenly all Gayans are facing imminent danger when a magic stone which protects their world, \"the Dalamite\", is beamed away by a mysterious force. Three Snurks immediately go after it, hoping to be the heroes for once. They are shortly followed by some standout Zeldons: Zino the trouble-prone popular guy & his sidekick, clever but somewhat cowardly inventor Boo, as well as rebel princess Alanta. Their journey ends up leading them all on a dangerous interdimensional quest to find the stone, while they must also figure out a way to get back to Gaya.","popularity":4.968,"poster_path":"/daqf0AgiiBAzbOyEJMn3LPr8HbZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambient Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2395,"logo_path":"/pZz4qs03FtP6UGtZ3hjQ6qimcwi.png","name":"HanWay Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-03-18","revenue":2844511,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to Gaya","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":79}
