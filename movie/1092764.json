One could hardly speak of any roads, only some trails formed through the centuries by man and animals. There where no bridges over the rivers, only one lighthouse and no man-made harbour to speak of. This documentary shows the evoliution of technology in Iceland and the great changes that the society has undergone since the first engineer arrived with new ideas and knowledge that has turned Iceland into a highly modern society in a very short span of time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":194484,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nýja Bíó","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Turfhouses to Technology","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
