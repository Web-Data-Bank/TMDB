What kind of images do we get of the world now that everyone is a photographer, and what does it do with how we unfold our identities? How has the internet both captured and freed us? And will Truls even dare to show this film?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pGt7cdQlXIH2rmFNTz7OXlE3Mkl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lofoten Film Collective","origin_country":""},{"id":191141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mattima Films AS","origin_country":""},{"id":194542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Altibox","origin_country":""},{"id":194543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krane Meby Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A New Lightness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
