A drama with some absurd. At the core of the dysfunctional relationship dynamics is none other than the grandmother, who raised the mother in a very oppressive way, with difficulty expressing unconditional love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jQdTTmHb5sAdL6V2jY0C0wBrNAR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pragma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
