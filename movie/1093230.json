Everyone has an answer. For many, manliness is a costume to be worn.  In this film, ordinary men ask themselves what led them to adopt the various postures of the manly man. Some of them, because they had to overcome an ordeal that questioned the meaning of masculinity, tell how they distanced themselves from the figure of the \"real man\".  With these intimate, amused and sometimes painful testimonies, director Cécile Denjean weaves a sensitive and powerful film. A film of those who move.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gh60RAeF6ciXH46jcnl36R7LfKK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Virilité","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
