At the time, protestors had no idea what they had prevented and how many lives they had saved. Told as a political thriller, the film is a David-and-Goliath tale that will engage viewers in a you-are-there experience with insider accounts from movement leaders and Nixon officials, commentary by historians, and illustrated with dynamic archival footage.","popularity":0.693,"poster_path":"/2C3WFrdN1SqeFQK9LKWwGnZrZxm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Movement and the \"Madman\"","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
