Preiss’s sharp editing is key in embodying Reichian techniques through film, while much of the repressed trauma informing Guagnini’s performance references a history of the dictatorship in his native Argentina in the 1970s and 80s.” –MISHKIN GALLERY","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rzawlR3xTtBGao8hTLX1eC14qwO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discharge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
