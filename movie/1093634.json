While the air is constantly interrupted by homophobic messages made of the intercepted military ciphers used by the Russian army, networks of love, empathy, and support become ever stronger. Produced as a close observation of everyday media practices and the social life of love relations, The Film of Sand takes a close look at the interrelations of war and intimacy, threat and empathy, fiction and documentation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Film of Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
