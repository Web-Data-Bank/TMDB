The split screen confronts statements of pedestrians and friends about the life of city memorials with a performative intervention of the artist climbing on the monuments. Memory is animated but also dismembered by an obsessive desire to inhabit and reappropriate the stony bodies of historical figures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Are No Monuments To Monuments","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
