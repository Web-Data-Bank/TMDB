Going through the unsettling phase of voice transition and subsequently losing his voice, the protagonist must plunge into the world's myriad sounds, turning his body into a locale of observation, absorption, and mimesis. Challenging the dominant narratives of voice articulation and able-bodiedness, he fearlessly embraces a fluid identity, a life without an accepted voice. What constitutes an eligible voice? How do we find our own voices in this chaotic world?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2023-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passaggio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
