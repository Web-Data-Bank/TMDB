A new kind of revolutionary music had emerged in 1976 but was receeding everywhere except in Iceland that had not yet seen punk rock. There you had Russian commie ghosts, nuclear foes, currency restrictions, beer was illegal and the TV was b/w six days a week. The population was trying to spend every penny as fast as they could because of inflation. Then in 1978 The Stranglers held a concert in remote Iceland and the punk rock bomb exploded in the face of the disco freaks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ruUzeZtL89c1ARDDbUntMnIAdXL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Markell","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2004-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1978 - No Beer - No Internet - Endless Disco - Something was bound to happen","title":"Punk in Iceland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
