In the distances between us lay textures so different from the soft and warm human touch that we longed for. Instead, I felt more conscious of the stretches of forlorn asphalt that had to be traversed as well as the rusted gates and moldy walls that actively prevented us from doing that.  The combination of separate still photography creates an intense and isolated look at these harsh textures frame by frame. The continuity harnessed ends up with a disjointed and off-beat sense of movement across it. One could think of a stretch of road as a reel of film, yet the frames of road presented here were not composed to merely move in one smooth direction. I wanted the textures to express listlessness at times. I hope that the blistering cuts create exhilarating motions that become overwhelming to the point of its abstraction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zPtE9zTA1VYIvsEqzyxPjXPjECo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194246,"logo_path":null,"name":"studio reisalte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2022-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"asfelt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
