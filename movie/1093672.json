Their goal was to stage their successful, Icelandic production of Romeo and Juliet in the historically renowned Young Vic Theatre in London. The group hijacks two floors of the shady Albany hotel for three months and then begin tireless rehearsals for the premiere. But life in London doesn’t come easy. Trouble on the stage and despair backstage is documented as we follow the group through the good times and the bad.  Will this ambitious theatre group from a small, volcanic island in the North manage the impossible and succeed in the big world? Or will they be forced to return home with their tails between their legs? Love is in the Air is an incredible story of achieving the impossible through perseverance and courage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jVwErClIAYaqbPTVjw0sqDpCacJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Klikk Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2004-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love is in the Air","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
