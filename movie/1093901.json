A rusting shipwreck on the rocks outside of Cabo San Lucas in 1972 provides a central and poignant metaphor for a macro-psychedelic and micro-expressionistic exploration of tropical colors and surfy forms. At the time many innovative and experimental in-camera techniques were used to create a dazzling and mysterious vocabulary of painterâ€™s eye multi-plane  cinema. Extensive abstract expressionist hand painting can also be seen in this final version. Meanwhile the shipwreck \"Inari Maru\" has disintegrated and disappeared back into the sea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Okeanos Painted Version","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
