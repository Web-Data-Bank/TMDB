The images seen mix with thoughts, occasionally fail, are sketchy. Only certain parts of the path are perceived and when you remember, these snapshots form a collage of some sort. With the technique of photogrammetry in Urban Dreamscape, these parts are captured and staged in such a way that they empathize with this phenomenon. Many individual photos are used to create 3D objects. These are edited, merged, and distorted. A dream landscape arises.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vF27KUK4WOBv4m6lxdO5892fzZp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Dreamscape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
