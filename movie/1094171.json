Originally produced to promote tourism in North America, these films are remediated by the filmmaker to create an abstract collage via the emulsion lifting/ emulsion grafting technique. Using this method, the filmmaker lifts by hand the emulsion layer from the film base and subsequently places it on a different film base. This way a celluloid collage is created, then re-animated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vx3cLgt6gcO65XSGv8BsmcttkQX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skyscraper Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
