The women lay bare their lives and deal with important issues that impact all women with humor, humility, humanity, and love. No topic escapes the razor-like wit and insight of these women: equality, sex, menopause, mortality, feminism, parenthood, careers, love, and even “me-too” moments.","popularity":2.478,"poster_path":"/8QZOosdCMdalaManHtK4rllfrYS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194888,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brecheen Feldman Breimer Silver \u0026 Thompson","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It’s time to get the girls back together.","title":"Chantilly Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
