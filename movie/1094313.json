Accompanied by appropriate music (the sonatas are not silent), each one moves through a period of time and place. Summer takes place in my first primarily annual garden. Joanna McClure is seen moving among the brilliant annual flower colors. Winter is a misty, mood-filled exploration of the Sonoma County hills and small lakes.
