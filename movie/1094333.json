Footage of the team of botanists who recently used their Solanum research to explode notions of sexual normativity in any plant or animal is combined with a voiceover of letters sent between science writer Rachel Carson and her lover Dorothy Freeman. \"There are things in this world that are yet to be named\" is a meditation on erasure, indefinability, and the intersection of queer and environmental histories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q90hkiQOuRjo1Z3Ee3lZXEqxnyo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There are things in this world that are yet to be named","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
