But we were not allowed by the Swedish Film Institute. At least we filmed some and cut it together into a short film. The class society is included. And a lot about the meaning of the work or lack of meaning. Because that’s what it’s about: the power over our work. That can be discussed based on this film.﻿ (Filmform)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hEJ0jVBYZmQsaKyN0kLGJPHnTWd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Förvandla Sverige","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
