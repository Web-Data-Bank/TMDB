Each day, with a bag filled with his own works, he hitchhikes to the city center where he writes poems and makes paintings (at least 15 a day) in his favorite cafes. As a retired actor he has a number of stories to tell which he stores using a portable tape recorder, and during Christmas time he dresses as Santa Claus. Though widely known in Iceland, Ketill remains a mysterious figure and an exception to the social norm. Joseph Marzolla and Tomas Lemarquis have created a film where the reality and the fantastical world of Ketill´s creations meet in an unforgettable journey. Ketill is a remarkable personality, who has a number of stories to tell and unusual experiences to share. He is a true artist, dedicated to his art and poetic in his everyday life.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":"/26Pf3HZ4ovzu3O8Qs9BEifiEnUy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ketill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
