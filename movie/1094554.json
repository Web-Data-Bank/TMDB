Since then, apparently lots of things have changed in their lives. With Rajeev´s “arranged wedding” as a story line the film reflects the great cultural difference the two friends live under today. Without a doubt, the Icelandic girl Birta sticks out among Hindus and elephants in this colorful wedding in south India. A sincere film about friendship that crosses the cultural difference between two continents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qXgDhfWQVepGlvrdHlVAIWGipJM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rajeev Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
