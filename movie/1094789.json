Yoko Ono talks about her and John Lennon’s love and life together, about the art they made together and their struggle for peace and justice, including the imaginative methods they used to get their message across: “Give peace a chance.”  Lennon’s music provides an inspirational soundtrack to a story that that began more than forty years ago and is still unfolding. In 2007, when Yoko Ono dedicated the Imagine Peace Tower to John’s memory she added: “My love for you is forever.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iFjVbmX25bJL0S2aji80ZwWvQLU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imagine Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
