Returning to Iceland, sick with tuberculosis, he found himself branded by both sides of the cold war political divide and barred from academic work. In desperation, he emigrated to East-Germany where he became a respected professor. He always hoped to return home but died in East-Berlin in 1988, a year before the wall came down. He left behind a wealth of documents, photographs, film and voice recordings which form the basis of this narrative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mLcujIGLp3oNzQK6fEPtDiKbTr0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Exile Thinking of Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
