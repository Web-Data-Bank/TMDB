The title is a palindrome, a sequence of letters that make (the same) sense when read forwards or backwards. In La Ruta Natural the hero seems to be adhering to a plan that ends with him blowing up a red balloon using compli-cated machinery and then letting it fly away. On his way, the hero drives a bright blue cabriolet down a spectacularly steep mountain pass. He then douses the vehicle with petrol and sets it alight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A6Bp98peI6lRBRrafubLCg5vj5l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2022-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Ruta Natural","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
