Bjarni (50) and his mother Sigrún (78), Mundi (93) and young farmer Skjöldur (35) are represented in this lyrical insight into a community that stuggles with market middlemen that press down produce prices, leaving increasingly less profit for the farmers themselves and threatening the fundamentals of their existence. Despite these adversities the community refuses to throw in the towel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w46nf0vWaM9nx7bkRAuUgXnLk5L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adequate Beings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
