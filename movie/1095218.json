A year after the non-violent demonstration those nine were charged and prosecuted for an ‘attack against parliament’, with reference to a sort of anti-terrorist clause in the penal code. The film is an attempt to investigate their vision: which lines of thought were pursued by those activists willing to go a few steps further than the general public 40 days before massive demonstrations overthrew Iceland’s government.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vwwV5mX2rIiZBuMFB5dxv91Wl2i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A9ainst","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
