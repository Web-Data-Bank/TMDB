Only, a couple of years ago, they didn’t know each other - now they're touring Europe together.  In 2006, Icelandic producer Valgeir Sigurðsson founded the Bedroom Community record label with Nico Muhly and Ben Frost, soon adding Sam Amidon to the intimate roster. After three years of concerts, collaborations and acclaimed album releases, the then four artists of Bedroom Community headed out together for a trek across Europe: The Whale Watching Tour.  More than just a series of concerts, the tour was an extension of the ongoing musical exchange between these diverse artists, having them contributing to each other's music on stage. The film follows the four artists on tour, but also provides insight into the colorful characters and explores the vision behind Bedroom Community as well as introducing the home of the label, the Greenhouse studios.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yM7oszwq02LtJZVfP2yuAakMVaa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything, Everywhere, All the Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
