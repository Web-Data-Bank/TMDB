Without obtaining any official permit and due to popular demand, he started cooking too and soon had a lively restaurant which is by now one of the most prosperous in Iceland, with top reviews in the NY Times and international media; one of Reykjavík’s landmarks. Instrumental in this success is Kjartan’s jovial and hospitable character, making every guest feel at home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sea Baron","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
