The Sturgis Trojans and the Pinconning Spartans were schools that were built from the ground up by communities that were unapologetically determined to do one thing - WIN. Both schools were championship caliber baseball teams that didn't know a thing about each other when they took the field at Battle Creek's Bailey Park to face-off in the 1999 MHSAA state championship. Finally, 22 years later, we have uncovered fascinating details about both teams, their run to the state finals, and the emotional thoughts and feelings behind one of the most memorable final innings in MHSAA history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k5uWlOghf4LnT8fX7RmdZMuPQqQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hype Brand Management","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary about the greatest high school baseball game...ever","title":"Stacked","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
