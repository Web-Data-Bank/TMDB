It's always been a bit of a local secret, until now. In Truck, owner Paul Miller opens up about some of the bar's dirtier stories; the invite-only \"Speakeasy\" parties, the backroom bartenders, the customers that stick around after closing time... as an unrivaled cast of hot men bring them to life. Find out what really goes on when the lights go down, as Mr. Pam and the NakedSword crew uncover the sweaty, sex-drenched tales behind this San Francisco institution.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/zb0Gneih2GKLDXtfTeDaQFSMpVD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78809,"logo_path":"/1HSXh5TFQbirsG9V9lgggH2nHDK.png","name":"NakedSword","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Truck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
