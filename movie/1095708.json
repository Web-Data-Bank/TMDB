Brian","overview":"This well-edited and narrated retrospective of gay fuck flick pioneer filmmaker J. Brian (Brian J. Donohue) sparkles precisely because of what it lacks: the artist himself, speaking in his own words.  This serious omission allows the artist's work to speak both for him and for itself, and allows the viewer a freshness unencumbered by bias. The work, five films and seven vignettes, speaks loudly of J. Brian's vision of youth, sexual freedom, and naturalism unfettered by society or its constraints.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/82V9J8PcB40qHMdi3OzgDxUBl1Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bijou Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best of J.
