They arrive in cars, trains, boats and buses, queue for the cable car, and then ski, snowboard, toboggan, eat, drink and fall asleep in one of the most beautiful landscapes in the world. In the evening the workmen come out to prepare the snow for the next day. It is the weekend of 11 and 12 February 2006 at the ski resort of Klewenalp and the film-maker has captured the portraits of Swiss men, women and children using a time lapse camera whilst all around them an extraordinary activity takes place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A companion piece to Paul Bushâ€™s 2004 film Shinjuku Samurai","title":"Central Swiss","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
