Excited, she tells Princess Shayla, who, along with Cole, returns to the cave with Alyssa. Tire Org comes after them and traps the Princess. When the Wild Zords hear the news, they send five Savage Cycles to help. The Princess is freed, but Tire Org grows bigger, and even MegaZord can't defeat him. The Princess is again captured and taken to Master Org, who demands possession of the mysterious animal power in the cave. When the Princess explains that the animal can only be freed by its rightful guardian, Master Org angrily destroys the key, trapping the animal inside forever. But suddenly, a crystal appears to Alyssa -- she has been chosen guardian! Alyssa releases the new Zord -- an elephant, and the new Wild Zord join forces with Megazord to try to defeat Master Org!
