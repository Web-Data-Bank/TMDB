Seeking revenge against the Rangers, he is puzzled by his apparently human tendencies when he rescues a wolf pup. Animus, the lord of the Wild Zords, appears to help Zen-Aku remember who he is, but Nayzor tricks him and he completely forgets who he is again. During a lunar eclipse, however, Zen-Aku suddenly transforms into his real human form -- that of Merrick, a powerful warrior. Merrick explains to the Rangers that 3,000 years ago, he put on the wolf mask to defeat Master Org, but was then cursed to become Zen-Aku. Princess Shayla orders the Predazord destroyed, believing this will remove the curse. The Rangers vanquish the Predazord, and Merrick becomes himself again! Trying to set things straight, Merrick sets off to face Master Org, but he meets up with Nayzor and the Quadra Org as well. Can he defeat them? If so, will this once very old friend become the Rangers' new friend and stay with them?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yjqXNaN93Eb9tHn3uqaMuy0tY2L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Power Rangers Wild Force: Identity Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
