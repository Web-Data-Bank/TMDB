Pushkina","overview":"A film illustration of the work of the great textual critic Sergei Mikhailovich Bondi, a Pushkinist, who said that Pushkin's drafts cannot be read and printed sequentially, from top to bottom. This is because Pushkin added to the line more than once, crossed out, changed something, and if we want to understand how Pushkin worked on the verse, we need to get into his psychology and sequentially remove layer after layer. The film uses animation techniques to analyze the Russian poet's writing process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bhf61vYDjFVH8W3EPlxVi39uEfb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pushkin's Manuscripts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
