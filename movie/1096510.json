After the consequences of confinement and medical negligence, Rita returned to Mexico, where she lives with Juanita, her niece, and primary caregiver, in a context of precarious economic possibilities. A moving portrait of the lives of these two Tarahumara women, questioning the multiple forms of racism and discrimination that indigenous women in Mexico and the United States face.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Woman of Stars and Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
