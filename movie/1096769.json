This imposing figure seems to have a profound effect on the conduct of each individual family member. At night ‘The Object’ eats pages from ideological texts, which it subsequently spits out again. Owing to this, the father figure, ‘Daddy’, changes radically from an elitist with liberal economic convictions, to someone who goes in search of collectivist ideals.  The Ourhouse series commenced production in 2010, with the latest episode completing production in 2016.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":106459,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nomad","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ourhouse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
