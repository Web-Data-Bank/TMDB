At the end of the road there’s a sleepy little fishing village known as Venice. An unincorporated community in the Plaquemines Parish for some of the best most diversified fishing we’ve even seen anywhere in the world. From fishing the shallows for record setting redfish and tarpon, to running outside to the rigs and fishing for tuna and sailfish, it honestly doesn’t get much better than this. Only problem is that they used to have a lot of bats, until the mosquitos ate ‘em all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qjlIJDaTj5I9u3Ds417pmSpGvM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inside Sportfishing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Best Little Fishing Secret in the Gulf: Venice, Louisiana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
