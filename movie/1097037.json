The abstract visuals, created by Charline Dally through modular synthesis and video feedback loops, are characterized by saturated hues and undulating lines. The sound, created by Gabrielle HB, conceives minimal spaces that rely on the delicacy of gesture and an economy of material means. Using two oscillators and a polyphonic synthesizer, she composes smooth and luminous scenes. Together, the sonic and visual oscillations blend and transform through deliberately slow progressions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Microstars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
