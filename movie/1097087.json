But when the feeding pins were set up off south of the boarder about a decade ago, an unexpected thing happened. With nothing else to do but swim in a giant pin and get fed, these initial school sized bluefin began spawning. Broadcast spawners the fertile eggs drifted outside the pins and a “new” school of baby bluefin tuna were created. With perfect water conditions and a plentiful supply of bait, these fish stayed around and year after year continued to grow and breed and before anyone really knew what was happening, we had a bluefin tuna fishery in our back yard. Initially 20 to 25-pound fish were being caught. Each consecutive year producing larger fish. This year we’re anticipating setting a new California state record when a 400-pound local fish will be captured.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t9L3fOySHKeMmr22Cq3FpVtbPlb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inside Sportfishing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reeling in the Dreams: Southern California Bluefin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
