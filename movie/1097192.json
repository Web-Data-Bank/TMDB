Being told by his doctor that he has only a few months left to live, he suddenly feels the emptiness at home. His wife, Anneke, has her own occupation. His two children are studying abroad, while the youngest rarely sleeps at home and eventually dies while playing Russian roulette. Dayan and Dewi find a mutual need to release the burden. The situation changes with the appearance of Ferico, an old school friend of Dewi, who continues to pursue her after his divorce. Both Dayan and Dewi finally return to their partners. Director Arifin chooses a “poetic” style of telling the story so that the storyline follows the internal conflicts of the characters. The poetry is also characterized by slick photography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162511,"logo_path":"/un8lguFbahqfdLARR1KZI5jfQWJ.png","name":"PT Rapi Film","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1986-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let the Moon Be","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
