LIDA BLINOVA","overview":"Lida Blinova is well-known in the scene of the first contemporary art wave, particularly amongst architects who were very much engaged in arts in 1970s Almaty. However, almost no legacy of her art practices is left for researchers, historians and following generations of today. Being in many senses a shadow-artist of a bigger star, her husband Rustam Khalfin, directors of the documentary are questioning the possibility of the freedom of choice among Kazakhstani women artists like Lida Blinova, embarking on a biographical journey through the genealogy of contemporary art and its formation in Kazakhstan.
