Macau used to have a brilliant shipbuilding industry, which peaked in the 1970s and 1980s. However, with the decline of the local fishery and changes in government policies, Macao's shipbuilding industry gradually declined until the last fishing boat was launched at the Lizhiwan Shipyard in 2006, marking the complete demise of Macao's shipbuilding industry. The once-prosperous Lizhiwan The shipyard was also in ruins. In such a big environment, the older generation of shipbuilders changed their job content for the sake of survival, love and ideals, hoping to give more light and heat to the inheritance of Macao's shipbuilding industry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8O80VGAUDdTo6r3h9Uq8NrTUrq9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MO","name":"Macao"}],"release_date":"2023-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shipwright","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
