My experience growing up with a helper inspired me to shine a light on the migrant domestic workers and their contribution to a home. The main challenge of creating this documentary was finding women willing to participate and to earn their trust. At the same time, I dedicated time to research the subject. For four months, I followed three different women capturing their daily routine and interviewing them on multiple occasions. This documentary chronicles diverse stories from the perspective of three different domestic helpers.  Each sharing their work experiences and dedication to provide a hopeful future for their family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3gbm299Q4SUpMpIEn0mrNQeMB1I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MO","name":"Macao"}],"release_date":"2023-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flowers For My Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
