Starting with her first encounter with the inhabitants, Mafrouza tells the stories of a few people who change as the months go by; the interactions create a polyphonic chronicle. Life is hard in Mafrouza, but the inhabitants resist with grace and strength: Adel and Ghada, a young couple in search of happiness; Mohamed Khattab, grocer-humanist-sheikh; Hassan, a freedom-loving-thug-singer; Abu Hosny, an old loner with a flooded home; the peasant Om Bassiouni with her bread oven; the Chenabou rag-and-bone family; Gihad, a young wrestler,... All of these people embody and tell of their own resistance, which makes the nieghbourhood a space of freedom and vitality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lJpiuGL9x4Pcft1DZyox3yYcI9f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":741,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A five-part chronicle of a neighbourhood in Alexandria","title":"Mafrouza","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
