O’Brady faced an ungodly windchill, the threat of unseen crevasses and utter isolation. In a head to head competition mirroring the race to the South Pole between Amundsen and Scott in 1911, O’Brady flew in the same Twin Otter aircraft with veteran polar explorer Captain Louis Rudd to ski from the Hercules Inlet to the start of the Ross Ice Shelf in a race to the record books. O’Brady finished two and a half days before Rudd, claiming a new world record, “The Impossible First,” to be the first person ever to cross Antarctica alone, with no support and no assistance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":127929,"logo_path":"/fCB4AVYvxxDvqumgYqsN6ehyN3G.png","name":"Searchlight Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Antarctica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
