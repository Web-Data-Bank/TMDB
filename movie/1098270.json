Väljasõit rohelisse","overview":"It is the year 2020. Disputes over Rail Baltic divide Estonia in two.  On one side, there are people who say they want to take the train to Berlin or Riga. They say that the train is more environmentally friendly and that Estonia needs this railway.  On the other side are people who say that the railway destroys nature, that the engineers have thought of nothing but how to draw the straightest possible line for the tracks.  Artist Hanna Samoson attaches cameras to her body and steps into the bush. For the next 12 days, she walks through pristine swamps, deep ditches and people's backyards to understand the world that lies in the future railway corridor.  On her journey, she meets the soul of Estonian people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uQFswAZTSkVPiL6WLx1OYxlxGnm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Levila","origin_country":""},{"id":145592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Klaasmeri","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2023-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trail Baltic: A Trip to the Green","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
