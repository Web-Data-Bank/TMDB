Through her personal encounters with some of Hong Kong’s most notable poets, Hui shows the  topography of contemporary poetry on and of the city. Two poles of reality, the unrestrained Huang Canran and the cosmopolitan Liu Wai-tong, are juxtaposed to reveal two distinctively different personalities, ideals, and ways of life. Seeing the late Xi Xi recite her own poem about the old Kai Tak Airport is a deeply heart-warming moment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3KR2jcmVSl5EA6mANzJECiCj79K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Class Limited","origin_country":""},{"id":63953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pica Pica Media Limited","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elegies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
