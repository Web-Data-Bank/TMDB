After every sense, every experience, every memory has gone, what happened to a mind? I want to consider the primitive mind that always exist as a shadow. I thought I could just see the mind if I try to turn around my body more carefully. I found the mind through the light which is core of everything. Even if passing very fast most of all, the light existed continuously, having trace of the all events. I'd like to talk about the light flow. I newly met a flow, a texture, a boundary of light that film could be contained through printing. During the process, I also explored light flow as disappearing and changing things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/OdVhHN2WQev6cVeIi1I5kweJ00.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light Flow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
