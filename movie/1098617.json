She leads a wonderfully full life, and - for the most part - wouldn't change a thing. Her other half and platonic life partner is Jake. They share an uncommonly close bond. Suddenly though, Sonali is left to examine her place in the world when Jake introduces a new, serious boyfriend. Sensing a fundamental shift, she spins out in a moment of doubt, even as she takes bold, decisive steps towards making a family in her own unorthodox way. In a world (even a gay one) that elevates traditional, heteronormative romantic relationships to be unquestionably the most important ones, is there a space for her? Where does she fit?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1IoEnXQYPfLOMq68Hv9q7BBk7k5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Albatross Cafe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
