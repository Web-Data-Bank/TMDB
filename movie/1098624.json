Created by video/internet artist Jared Mitchell, the film inserts Vaughan into the rain-dappled, shadowed and dreamy world of film noir - turning the poet into Hayden’s moll, lover, and dumb broad. A film about living your life “in the right movie,” queer projection onto mainstream cinema, and the collision of fantasy and reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I’m Sorry, Sterling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
