And behold, his house became a battlefield between Good and Evil. The good was based on Hersz Dubrown's pure soul - and Satan reached for this soul. He lost her and corrupted her with money. . . Satan first appeared as a lottery ticket seller. He persuaded Hersz to buy a lottery ticket, let him win and get rich. And Hersz for winning the lottery - tempted by Satan - sets up a factory and produces mechanically. . . tallit. Satan, in the form of the merchant Uriel Mazyk, ruins the homeworkers who make tallits by hand. But Satan cannot defeat Hersh Dubrown. When he was up to his ears in sins, he punishes himself - he commits suicide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Si≈Ça-kino","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1912-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God, Man and Satan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
