No bitterness, no unemployment and no right-wing radicals, but instead 60 people full of joie de vivre and warmth.  The people of Wrodow are proud of their castle, which was bought 6 years ago by a youth judge, his wife and the painter Sylvester Anthony from the West. It is the venue for opera balls, Venetian masked balls, modern exhibitions and concerts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonderful Wrodow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
