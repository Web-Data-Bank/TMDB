Most of them are experimental films shot on 8 mm material without sound. During the editing the films were synchronized with alienated, deformed music from magnetic tapes. The films were shown in universities, during parties or in music clubs. Some of the films were used later on as elements of scenery in the theatre piece \"Zigger Zagger\" by Peter Terson. They were projected contemporaneously on different screens in front, behind and on both sides of the audience in the theatre of Münster. » (Georg Brintrup)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m48ijWI8lLQt6qTCt3d2VleamUR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
