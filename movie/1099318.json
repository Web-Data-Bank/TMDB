It engaged with contemporary issues that mainstream media were eager to sensationalise. Consequently, it was branded with an 18 certificate and banned by both the BBC and ITV, never reaching a wider audience. For the past three decades, Weekender has bubbled just below the surface, gaining genuine cult status and influencing a vast network of creators. In the run-up to its thirtieth anniversary filmmakers Tabitha Denholm and Adam Dunlop interviewed people involved in the project. I Am Weekender is built around those conversations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Weekender","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
