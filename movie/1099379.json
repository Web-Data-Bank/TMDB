We live in a continuous sensory bombardment of distractions that keep us in the role of passive consumers – a condition that has not exactly improved since the revolutionary 60s. What to do? And how do you film a notoriously complicated theory that attacks the very image itself? Artist Roxy Farhat and filmmaker Göran Hugo Olsson (‘Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975’) bring Guy Debord’s ideas into the 21st century. Guy Debord’s own (anti)films are given a modern counterpoint by satirical interventions in a visual work that is not afraid to criticise neither itself nor the cult around Debord and situationism.","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/4ITnrszPCeJV51DGiphxrBeaoeX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2023-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You don’t hate Mondays, you hate capitalism.","title":"The Society of the Spectacle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
