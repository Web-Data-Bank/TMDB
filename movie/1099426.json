In between bouncing, she drags the trampoline through the snow - an exhausting exercise judging by her heavy puffing.  Marja Helander is a descendant of the Ohcejohka (Utsjoki) Sami on her father's side. Many of her works deal with the challenges of straddling two cultures as part-Finn, part-Sámi. In her early series of photographs The Generations, she juxtaposes self-portraits with old family snapshots and archival material from the Finnish Heritage Agency.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trambo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
