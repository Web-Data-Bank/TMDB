Fuji in the background and the sky dyed akane red. As night fell, we flew downtown, looking out over the Keihin industrial area and Tokyo International Airport. The container terminal, Odaiba, and Rainbow Bridge are all beautiful with lights shining on the water. Tokyo Tower is decorated in Christmas colors and Shibuya is illuminated. Shinjuku, Ginza, and Tokyo Station are all full of urban atmosphere. You can enjoy expressive aerial night views of Yokohama and Tokyo, as well as the best visual beauty such as the Tokyo Sky Tree towering over a carpet of light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yjtNLcrVD92n9P2qS3WrBkpO7Z9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8K空撮夜景 SKY WALK (スカイウォーク)TOKYO/YOKOHAMA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
