In reality, they lose autonomy over their own seed. Director Lynn Deen started the film out of frustration: Why was the woman always the one to carry the burden that comes with lust? Gradually she saw that this luxury position actually places men in a dangerous position of dependence. They have virtually no control over both the prevention and the termination of a pregnancy. That is why they should be more involved in preventing pregnancy. Not only for women, but especially for themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pkfhykDP4zoSBaGU3ygQjvIW5xi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8659,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baas in eigen Zak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
