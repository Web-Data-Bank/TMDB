Be it your pretentious taste in music, your fugly clothes, your insipid pseudo-intellectual rantings, or your poseur attitude, she will find you and she will make you pay.  Love is for losers, and PDA couples make BITCH want to puke razor blades. That is until she meets FUCKER (Juan Garcia), a guy as antisocial as she is.

Only if she can win him, but she may have to kick his ass first.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tQp5Wo1NbD15UfrUxuyaJszS8xt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bitch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
