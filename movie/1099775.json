Within the confines of a courtyard two demure little girls are playing a game of confinement, entrapment, escape. An elastic band has been stretched into a rectangle around four points –the legs of one girl and of a chair. At first the rectangle is positioned close to the ground. Silent with concentration, the girls take turns bracing the elastic and performing a prescribed sequence of jumps on and around the tensed bands. Ankles are entangled and then jump free. As the elastic rises higher, more and more of the body is involved in skilful contortions and athletic, perilous choreography. There’s no ultimate winning, just getting better at the dance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u6ZsQzx6xupkb1cCjNJRfennDto.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #4: Elastic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
