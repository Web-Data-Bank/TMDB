These are “Millworker,” “Brother Trucker,” his hit cover of Goffin and King’s “Up on the Roof,” and “I Will Not Lie for You,” which are interspersed among staples from an already rich catalog. These include “Carolina in My Mind,” “Handy Man,” “Don’t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,” “Long Ago and Far Away,” “Mexico,” “Walking Man,” “Sweet Baby James,” “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You),” and “Fire and Rain.” Recorded at Blossom Music Center, Ohio.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17,"logo_path":"/7Qu05UOqxdTGLl3kOvkRBv723Vz.png","name":"Warner Bros.
