A little nostalgic for his native Italy, Geronimo runs a thriving cake boutique in 1950’s New York. Between an aristocratic customer and a humble delivery boy, will his daughters make the right choices in love?  Il matrimonio segreto, a dramma giocoso in two acts, is Domenico Cimarosa’s best-known opera. The first performance took place on 7 February 1792 at the Hofburgtheater in Vienna in the presence of Emperor Leopold II, who liked it so much that, after giving dinner to the whole company, he asked for a complete second performance - perhaps the longest encore in history. As with the best opera buffa of the 18th-century, it contains a plot full of impossible situations (might just one of the daughters be married already?), elaborate disguises and, of course, a happy ending.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/he5iqSaOg8wILksR0KLA9eEQWzt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il matrimonio segreto - Cimarosa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
