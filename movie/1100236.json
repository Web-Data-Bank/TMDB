Over the last fifty-one years he has managed to release a further twenty-two studio albums plus dozens of others that include live albums, cover albums, reinterpretations of previous releases, movie soundtracks, classical albums and even underground techno collaborations. In this video I rank his twenty-two studio albums and then sum up the rest of his work in a lightning round list towards the end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mYKYKbqvCKMSNAUHLOiwmp1SOvb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Paul McCartney Album Ranked Worst to Best","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
