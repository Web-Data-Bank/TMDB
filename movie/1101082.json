Return to Eden refers to Josef Klein's return to America after several decades abroad, but return to Eden also refers to a longing for absolutes, for a return to paradise, which seems essential if we are to survive this time of darkness. A perspective he shares with the young girls he mentors, as a volunteer tennis coach at one of the local high schools, and a passion which is responsible for his deep sense of loneliness, a feeling of not belonging. Loneliness which is temporarily relieved when he meets Hope, a brilliant and equally lonely woman, who happens to be a dancer in Puritan Eden's only strip club. An unlikely and exhilarating friendship with tragic consequences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8bNp8KcuYrLu6FziezUAor2axC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
