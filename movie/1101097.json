After studying photography, Eshetu began making videos in early 1982, seeking to deconstruct the hegemonic status of television, which he viewed as a state apparatus. His practice encompasses documentaries, installations, and films, and he uses moving images “to create or construct an artistic message, a sort of personal reality rather than an institutional reality or a political reality.” Born in London and based in Rome, Eshetu, whose work has been shown in the Venice Biennale, is interested in cultivating a global perspective in his art, drawing inspiration from his pan-national life, including his upbringing in Senegal and Ethiopia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anima Mundi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
