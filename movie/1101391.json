The film traces the journey of butter from cows grazing, to milking, to the final churning of milk into a crock of gold – packets of butter –  much to the delight of the children. It is a simple delight, and moments like the creative sound mixing in the laboratory scene gives you a taste of Spence’s filmmaking talents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/55MV4O27Ay9HL3syBJHuNyyIWeK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crock of Gold","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
