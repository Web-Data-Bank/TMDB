Mary Wilson, Mary McMahon and Rose Feeney show various intricate lacework techniques that were inspired by their natural surroundings, as well as teaching us the history and language of lace through detailed demonstrations, all captured beautifully in this film by Roy Spence for the Ulster Folk Museum.  Although the popularity of lacework has declined in recent years, the Ulster Folk Museum continues to preserve these disappearing traditions for future generations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uQWs1sI3aiyvg9mKrSbxpZCN7Z5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dots, Whips and Cobwebs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
