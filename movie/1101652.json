The founders of the Platoschool had great ideals, ideals that the parents of documentary maker Yara Hannema fell in love with. The children would grow into special people with a high level of consciousness, but the teachers ran wild in their strictness and discipline. There was beating and abuse of authority. The school was discredited and had to close its doors in 2002.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1NSD7TDnv8CZHJTAttyLkcgshN9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100462,"logo_path":"/24dhPKt8sDtfWfNs1rsVtskOwZZ.png","name":"BNNVARA","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":83904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hollandse Helden","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Platoschool","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
