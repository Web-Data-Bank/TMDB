LIVE IN ORANGE CO. celebrates nearly two decades of the band's trawl through the Americana sewer with both their second live DVD and fourth live release. Fans should lap up this \"unrated\" package; it features a more blistering, electric set than its lone predecessor, LIVE IN ANAHEIM, and proves that the adage \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" applies to oversexed, Satan-honoring, greased-back gutter punks perhaps better than anything else. And that's a compliment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eWo49sSWj3dnSD5YKZQef3I6Zje.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supersuckers: Live in Orange County","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
