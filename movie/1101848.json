The pressure of churning out sponsored social media posts to fund their new lifestyle has taken its toll on their relationship and for Katie, they’ve reached the end of the road. When Ella makes a deal with her to shoot one last ad for an organic dog food brand, neither of them are quite prepared for the challenges of torrential weather and a bloodthirsty terrier. Gaia is a bleak British comedy, savagely skewering the fantasy of getting away from it all.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
