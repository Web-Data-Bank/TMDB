However, anything that looks perfect can be as lonely as it is deafening. When her family's dreamy disposition started to deafen and shatter her inner peace with their voices of misery: expectations, pressures and judgements, reality became loud and clear. In the end, she exploded as her cries have muffled and held her voice as a hostage in despair. But a sound of hope may resonate at last.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bE6Fvz5JnD067ToXH6TQHqjRdbF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is it not okay not to be okay","title":"Seen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
