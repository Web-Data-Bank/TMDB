A recent college graduate, Monique has to make a decision: will she go along with her parents' wishes and leave the house a married woman, or pursue her dreams instead? She'd like to start off by discovering the world, making a career for herself, acting in Bollywood musicals and living on her own for a while. Her wishes and desires aren't all that different from Dutch girls; they clash with Hindustani traditions, in which women are expected to get married as soon as possible.
