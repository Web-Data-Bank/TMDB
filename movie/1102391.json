Yet, the body continues to function as her primary medium and the performances were seldom performed directly for the camera, although the awareness and necessity of film documentation was obvious for the artist. The first of a cycle of those seances, titled Dreaming, was conducted in 1978. The actions adopted different forms – Natalia LL was asleep in the presence of the viewers or only with the camera as a witness; she was also experimenting with sleeping in the pyramid. Those seances stemmed from the pursuit of reaching the subconscious – the artist very often noted down her dreams immediately after waking up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Ia1Piq4n8cFUHAAzfzIMHQO86O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pyramid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
