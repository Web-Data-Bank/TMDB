After sweeping the Seattle Mariners in the ALDS and the New York Yankees in the ALCS, their showdown was set against the red-hot, hard-hitting Philadelphia Phillies. And though Philadelphia would jump out to a 2 games to 1 lead, the Astros lifted off behind a stellar bullpen; the second no-hitter in World Series history; and sensational offense. After a resounding Game 6 victory at Minute Maid Park, Baker earned his long-awaited first World Series ring as manager.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A5j8Ki2S1BOgc8vT6gVKcEFRSFE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome to Space City, Home of the Houston Astros","title":"2022 Houston Astros: The Official World Series Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
