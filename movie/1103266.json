The things he talks about are different, his memories are different. Chanoch is an Auschwitz survivor. After forty-four months in various concentration camps, he was liberated from Gunskirchen in 1945 at the age of twelve. Film material from the archive combines fragmentarily with recordings of Chanoch, a contemporary witness, and the memories of the individual ultimately become a fragment of a collective history.","popularity":0.663,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Boy's Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
