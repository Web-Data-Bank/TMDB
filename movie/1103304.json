On this scene, Hellenes, Jews, Armenians, Syriacs, and Muslims contributed to and significantly nourished each other. Regardless of whoever influenced or affected whom, followers of different religions have had a convergence, a common art and style of expression throughout history. Music that brings humans together and connects them with the divine, despite different languages and religions, has been the most essential, effective, and dominant expression throughout history. Art, in that respect, happens to be our common cultural heritage as the most virtual product that humanity has brought forth.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/5mf76kwgSiQKrcvmvzZ2cAcHnc8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sounds of Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
