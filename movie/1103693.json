This film tries to answer such questions by combining documentary scenes with elements of acting and a clear dramatic arc. For one of two brothers, a forced journey to Vietnam becomes an opportunity to better understand his origins, and thus his own parents and even himself. Czech viewers get a chance to see behind the wall of uniform cultural stereotypes and breathe life-giving movement into the minority.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":196360,"logo_path":null,"name":"AZN kru","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2016-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mat goc","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
