In the 1930s, when Americans longed to escape the grim realities of Depression-era life, four men turned Seabiscuit into a national hero. They were his fabulously wealthy owner Charles Howard, his famously silent and stubborn trainer Tom Smith and the two hard-bitten, gifted jockeys who rode him to glory. By following the paths that brought these four together and in telling the story of Seabiscuit's unlikely career, this film illuminates the precarious economic conditions that defined America in the 1930s and explores the fascinating behind-the-scenes world of thoroughbred racing. Scott Glenn narrates.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mSPbTGa0vXwlHU4MU9ceJ1Aod17.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seabiscuit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
