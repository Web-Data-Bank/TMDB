Manuel Foffo, a 29-year-old university student, from a wealthy family, confesses to his father Valter the atrocious crime committed during a sex and drug-based party that lasted three days and three nights and which involved another boy named Marco Prato, thirty years old, homosexual and well known in the Roman environment of organized parties. Manuel and Marco, totally addicted to alcohol and cocaine, allegedly lured Luca Varani into Manuel's apartment on a pretext to then drug him, torture him and finally kill him cruelly with hammers and stabs. Manuel Foffo will plead guilty and will be sentenced to thirty years in prison with the abbreviated procedure, while Marco Prato, who will claim to be innocent and only subjected (for love) to Manuel's will, will commit suicide the day before the start of the trial.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/53yR9suHzAXlMpvbGhy3mVLSJbv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110397,"logo_path":null,"name":"A+E Networks Italy","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":134372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Briciola TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il delitto Varani","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
