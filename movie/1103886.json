However, George's heart, his passion, and his greatest talent lay elsewhere, in his work with the male nude. This work, sensuous and radically explicit for its time, has only recently begun being fully discovered and appreciated for the revolution that it represents - a man capturing his fantasies as a gift, a window to a future his camera saw coming before anyone else. From visionary art director Sam Shahid, HIDDEN MASTER features a stunning collection of photography from the 1930s-50s, uncovering the life of Lynes less known: his gifted eye for the male form, his long term friendships with Gertrude Stein and Alfred Kinsey, and his lasting influence as one of the first openly gay American artists.","popularity":1.033,"poster_path":"/kT9uCRmHMTix8DZN1YL3RLjS3ty.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hidden Master: The Legacy of George Platt Lynes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
