That's what happened with me and my wife, Irene (Angela White). She buried herself in her work, working long hours, and I know she loves me, I know she didn't know how to cope with the grief of what was happening to me. My efforts to bring us together only pushed her farther away until I got the call from the doctor. I wasn't just in remission, the cancer was gone-- it's official! We made love, it was honest, passionate love from a woman who loved me more than I could comprehend. \"If you leave, I'm going with you,\" she told me. I was overwhelmed by her love, and although I love her, I could not stay with her knowing my presence does her more harm than good. If I leave her, go back to my previous love, would it be better for her? Is it a kindness to leave my wife knowing that I could someday become sick again, and what would become of her? The answer is yes. I must leave her.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/eA7H4HNioyr4HyliiIas1vTB9VY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129315,"logo_path":"/n7Dmi4eY7QsD5JY2sXioweN5jpi.png","name":"AllHerLuv","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasons","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
