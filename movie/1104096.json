But indecision or new types of relations that society forces us to follow, as well as the desire to keep up with everyone, do not allow us to see this person. Sometimes, in vain hope to reach some false ideals, we manage not to notice this kindred spirit, no matter how close he/she is. The plot of the film called \"the Maiden Tower\" tells about a casual acquaintance of two different people, each of them having their own personal relationships. However, during the acquaintance, both of them realize that they have met \"their kind of man.\" Throughout the film, the characters have to make a choice: either keep everything as it is and return to their lives or start a new relationship with \"their kind of man\", and this is what each of them has always secretly dreamt.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jVoEIaIl7VdXMoberDKyA9jvm9q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2023-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Maiden Tower","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
