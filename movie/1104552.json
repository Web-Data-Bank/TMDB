Uninterested in distractions from the world around her, Jane pores over books and analyzes notes in a frantic search for her way out of the curse she believes herself to be under: an untimely death at twenty-seven years old just like many of her artistic idols. Jane ignores repeated phone calls and angrily throws her phone away, working into the night and passing out from exhaustion. After waking up alive, Jane begins cleaning up her apartment and repairing her phone, ready to live without fear of her inevitable mortality and to appreciate life while it's happening.
