At 50, she has already won several literary prizes and published around forty novels and essays, but is resuming her militant fight with renewed vigor. She is the first to define ecofeminism, denouncing the common oppression of women and the planet as a consequence of patriarchy. She participated in the actions of the MLF (Women's Liberation Movement), in the creation of the FHAR (Homosexual Revolutionary Action Front) and theorized counter-violence, going so far as to sabotage the construction site of the Fessenheim nuclear power plant. This film presents unpublished documents for the first time. Drawing freely from the manuscripts and photographic archives that she bequeathed to the Memory Institute for Contemporary Publishing, her relatives and researchers, historians and publishers comment on the resonance of her feminist and ecological heritage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w8FgKFFURbXcpOyq5lXr1pXkgtC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sancho \u0026 Co","origin_country":""},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":311,"logo_path":"/TNGvZ8zOklntjPP3EcsHtrR8Rc.png","name":"PROCIREP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Françoise d'Eaubonne: une épopée écoféministe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
