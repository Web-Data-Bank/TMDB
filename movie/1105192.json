While there are 430,000 Cherokee citizens in the three federally recognized tribes, fewer than an estimated 2,000 fluent speakers remainâ€”the majority of whom are elderly. The covid pandemic has unfortunately hastened the course. Language activists, artists, and the youth must now lead the charge of urgent radical revitalization efforts to help save the language from the brink of extinction.","popularity":0.701,"poster_path":"/smBZeY82qyKfNvKDVLXDkMXIB6n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blurry Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dadiwonisi (We Will Speak)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
