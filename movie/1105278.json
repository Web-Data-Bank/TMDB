She is talented, strong, smart, cool and is excited about life. But soon we face mental illness, drug abuse, chaos, alienation, homelessness and the great sadness after the death of best friend Isak. The painting and creativity that has long been her vent, slowly fades as the addiction increases. At times, she sees herself as nothing more than an intrusive parasite as she has no home of her own.  Meanwhile, Psyko’s mother anxiously searches for tags from her daughter, in order to get a sign of life. Together with Isak’s mother Helena, who has become like an extra mother to Psykos, she is afraid that at any moment they may receive a difficult news – that Psykos has followed the same path as Isak.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yZM5FmTqwo8qSGmHaBFccln0rf5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A talented graffiti writer struggles with trauma, substance abuse and homelessness","title":"Ink, Blod och Strumpor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
