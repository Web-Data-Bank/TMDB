This emergency, however, results from a deeper and much longer-term crisis - that of poverty and inequality. We Cried Power is a forthcoming feature-length documentary film by Dara Kell, that examines the crisis of poverty through the perspective of the leaders and voices of a new social movement, the Poor People’s Campaign.  The documentary We Cried Power is an intimate account of a \"season of resistance,\" told through his eyes and the mothers, veterans, preachers, and students who are the voices and founding members of this new “fusion” movement. The film bears witness to the profound process by which those without power decide not to accept their powerlessness. Instead, they claim - through protest, dance, song, and poems, through testimony and tears - their birthright: to live decent lives in the United States of America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Cried Power","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
