At the temple on Koh Donsingtham, he meets JATE, a sculptor who uses spells on his payon dolls. Tham has heard a rumor that Monk Tee has run away after killing the previous abbot, but Tham doesn’t believe that his brother is capable of killing anyone. He also questions the villagers’ faith in the Doll of Great-Grandfather Singtham. He sees it as blind superstition rather than spiritual protection. Then, a series of vicious events terrorizes the village. A woman has gone missing. Dead bodies pile up. Worst, the Doll of the Great-Grandfather is destroyed. The villagers are seething with rage and prepare a ritual to curse and hunt down the knife-wielding culprit.","popularity":1.808,"poster_path":"/4xQGGBC2vpXiUX3xLX92q6c9Y4Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1241,"logo_path":"/m0pcwdXt4FgzaBtoSMfXoNucgoz.png","name":"Five Star Production","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2023-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fear.
