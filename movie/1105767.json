With behind the scenes footage and detailed interviews, this documentary offers a deeper insight into the music and art project, and marks an unprecedented openness for IAMX in an effort to create a deeper connection with his fans.  Known for colossal live productions that include performance, light, and video art, IAMX shows offer fans a catharsis through the spectacle of stage. Mental health is a core component of the IAMX philosophy, and as a unique feature of this tour, IAMX partnered with The You Rock Foundation to host Mental Health Gatherings at select stops. These gatherings brought fans together to share their experiences and resources, and to find support through the IAMX community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tZ1gGm9oLq2idWcmG5UZRc1tIpG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Mile Deep Hollow documentary follows Chris Corner and his live band (Janine Gezang, Sammi Doll, and Jon Siren) from their early rehearsals in Southern California to the end of the tour in Moscow.","title":"Mile Deep Hollow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
