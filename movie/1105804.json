A hybrid fiction-documentary film about a traveller from Iran whose shadow wants to make itself independent upon arrival in Germany. Facing it and gazing at the shadow with the help of his video camera, memories and flashbacks cut rhythmically into the traveller’s records of the present until a remix of his past and future occurs.
