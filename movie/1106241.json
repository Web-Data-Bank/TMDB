The result is a free-flowing pastiche whose essence is the filmmaker's love of husband, babies, friends, and West Coast. Freude's work is a rare example of feminist filmmaking infused with humor, poetry, and sensuality.\" â€”Karen Cooper","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Life in Art","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
