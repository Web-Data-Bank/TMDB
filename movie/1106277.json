The ship is rapidly tearing apart as the waves batter it against the rocky coastline. The lifeboats wreck before they can escape and the stern sinks rapidly. It seems hopeless for everyone aboard Atlantic, but rescue is on its way in the form of a small group of local fishermen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":196753,"logo_path":null,"name":"HFX Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Terrifying Wreck of the SS ATLANTIC (Halifax, 1873 - 150th ANNIVERSARY)","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
