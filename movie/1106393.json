No certain destinations, moving with one-way-tickets, being surrounded by strangers… Continuous packing and unpacking, almost daily check in and out even in the same town to taste different flavors of it… Throbs of excitement and anxiety and unusually wide-open perception in consequence of putting myself in every possible mysterious moment… My anonymity allowed me to immerse myself within the subtle sounds and lights, so often passed by as to fade into nonexistence, that amplified and grew conspicuous in total silence/darkness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mxWFU8niRiIDYNzfCnD8J4LjhQH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(k)now (t)here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
