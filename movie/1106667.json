Released in May 2009, this film attempts to capture the complexities of reclaiming a language from documentation for the Myaamia people.  Dormant-language revitalization is becoming a reality for many tribes and this film challenges the academically imposed label \"extinct\" that often gets applied to languages that have lost their native speakers. The Myaamia people have experienced unprecedented changes in their community over the last 15 years due to their language and cultural revitalization programs. Although this video was created for the Myaamia community, we hope the story will empower other communities who are trying to revive their languages from documentation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myaamiaki Eemamwiciki: The Miami Awakening","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
