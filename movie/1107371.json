Because each unit of the exposition is so painstakingly conceptualized and nurtured, an audience is afforded a unique kind of purview on the elements as they are reconstituted in the more complex overlays. Thus the early, Magritte-like compositions of eye and sky establish basis for later more complicated efforts .... Color changes worked on given images (the bird, the sky) avoid the oversimplifications of hues/cues. Certain effects, as when clouds pass through the falling body which is outlined in flaming orange, can only be described as awesome. ... [A] work of immense dedication and exceptional skill.\" â€“ John Fell","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/YpJaFNWzQObVzpR7UEFZF5hxnY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
