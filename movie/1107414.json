If they chose Indonesian, they were obliged to change their Chinese name into an Indonesian name. Still a taboo subject in Indonesia, this magical-realist documentary follows 87-year-old Indriati, who is haunted by her past name in the form of a silver bird that follows her everywhere she goes. As Indriati goes about her quiet routine, a bird sits on a windowsill, spying on her. Its silver skin is almost mythical in appearance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s9w2tPvSYKxCjpQAAollb9L9woj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Talamedia","origin_country":""},{"id":198244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umbra Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Javanese","iso_639_1":"jv","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Grandmother Is A Bird","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
