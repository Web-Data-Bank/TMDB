When he meets August, Clayton is almost immediately at ease, charmed by how natural the connection feels. The date comes to a screeching halt when August casually mentions his partner, and Clayton walks out on him, aggressively judging his choice to be polyamorous. With his suave veneer fractured, a dejected August seeks comfort from the one person who understands how it feels to seek romance outside a relationship: his boyfriend. A newly confident August then makes the best of what's left of his night by meeting up with a stranger from Grindr for a little night cap.","popularity":0.851,"poster_path":"/jWCpMZTLAdvzFtZY1eyqDPtGaoY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Why are the good ones always taken?","title":"Polywood","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
