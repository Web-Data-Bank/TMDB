Film-portrait of an emblematic figure of French mountaineering in the 1950s and 1960s, reconstructing the life, the great races and the expeditions of the \"conqueror\" of the most difficult walls and summits of Europe, the Himalayas, the Andes and North America. Marcel Ichac produced in 1966, the day after the Gerbier accident, this illustrated tribute by bringing together personal archive documents, unpublished animated sequences or extracts from expedition images as well as comments taken from the autobiographical texts of Lionel Terray \" The Conquerors of the Useless\" and \"Battle for Jannu\". This film, presented at the Cannes Film Festival, has won numerous awards at specialized film festivals, including the Trente Festival and the Banff Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fXKj2P1sjN2vnXahXMHU1iFWVDu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmartic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1966-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Conqueror Of The Useless","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
