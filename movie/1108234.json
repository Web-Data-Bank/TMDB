In eight chapters – from “Virgin Birth” to “The Seventh Day” – she shows how the oppressive utopia has been exchanged for meaningless freedom. Black and white archive material of flag parades and Russians kissing each other has been cut with contrasting current street images in colour. The homemade sounds and communist battle songs under the silent archive material give the experimental film a comical effect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Punainen raketti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
