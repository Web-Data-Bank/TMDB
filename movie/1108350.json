She calls them the Pure Unknown.  These Pure Unknown often belong to the fringes of society. They are homeless, sex workers, runaway teenagers. Lately, they have mostly been migrants, rejected by the Mediterranean Sea onto the shores of Italy.  If all rights belong to the living, nothing is left to the dead. So what happens when the dead have lost their identity?\r In the face of this growing multitude, no one seems concerned about their right to dignity.\r No one but Cristina.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/iQ8jOwl4tJc0sBRqdswvIzq6Cvf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jump Cut","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":122296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sisyfos Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":113179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amka Films Productions","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pure Unknown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
