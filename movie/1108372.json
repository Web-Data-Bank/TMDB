A born-and-bred New Yorker, she studied at the best music schools and performed on Broadway. Her future was sparkling bright . . . But today, the only thing that glitters is the snow that falls on the desert. Self-exiled in Madrid, New Mexico, far from the glitz and glamour of the Big Apple, Caiti’s looking for a way forward. In this former ghost town, surrounded by mountains and old hippies, between her day job slinging drinks to tourists and the sleepless festive nights, her life is slipping by. That’s the story she tells each day on her radio show. As the United States sinks into madness and the world turns terrifyingly absurd, Caiti feels increasingly suffocated. She’s about to turn 30 and her future has never felt so uncertain. How can she find her way back to a place of meaning and self-expression?","popularity":2.741,"poster_path":"/80FoJU3bWjrhoIQHW3vqCQTUpWq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107531,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinquième Maison","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":75502,"logo_path":"/4V3r88JWn7QuWuRVjF8P6R75vyh.png","name":"Sister Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caiti Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
