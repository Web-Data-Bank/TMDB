Barr cuts between the rigorous discipline of rehearsal, Brown's meticulous preparations in her dressing room, and the actual performance. Through the course of the tape, Barr traces Brown's metamorphosis, paralleling her physical and mental transformation with the transformation from rehearsal to performance. Anchoring the work on one central and riveting image — Carmen's measured and sensual walk toward her lover — Barr returns to it throughout, zooming closer with each successive sequence until it culminates in the performance itself. By focusing on this one memorable and essential sequence, Barr articulates and magnifies the taut expressiveness of Brown's choreography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trisha and Carmen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
