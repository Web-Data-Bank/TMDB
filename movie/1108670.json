Embodying the early recordings of Johnny Cash, Elvis, Carl Perkins brewed with his signature Texas juke joint cool, Dale Watson is what country is, was and should always be. Recorded at the fabled Sun Studios in Memphis, TN, The Sun Sessions is an album that deserves the label of \"instant classic.\" Backed by The Texas Two, these 14 original tracks turn love, heartache and the unsung heroes of our everyday lives into legend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":197078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red House Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dale Watson & The Texas Two: The Sun Sessions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
