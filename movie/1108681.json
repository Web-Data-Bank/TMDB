Surrounded by flowers, fruits, juices and other delicacies, Tejal Shah and Marylea Madiman, dressed in Indian traditional clothing, sit side by side. Shah remains passively seated while her partner brutally feeds her. The excessive eating creates an erotic tension and the interaction between the two blurs the line between sex and aggression. In a provocative way, the human condition, the relationship between violence and power, the body and identity are questioned.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ntcRHf84oaFs5eEJ0XWF0ghSjYS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feed/Kill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
