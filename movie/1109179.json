Culled from scores of VHS tapes, MRC is an 85-minute bombast of talk shows, sitcoms, commercials, instructional videos, and pure analog glitch. Images aggressively jockey for foremost position in the viewerâ€™s mind. Jingles, one-liners, purple prose weave in and out of inadvertent musicality, forming a clattering soundtrack. Smash edits, smeary abstractions, and overlays create subliminal threads between lust and sensitivity, sex and death, steak and lobster, Steve Urkel and nuclear holocaust. Visual diamonds picked and arranged out of a grungy heap of cultural detritus. A museum of microseconds. Dots on a timeline. Connect them as you see fit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8UYczLk8kM6LM3otebowH5RwsDW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Math Rock Countdown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
