Set to the Japanese ending theme of the first season of the Pok√©mon anime, it is notable for popularizing the genre of Animutations, surreal Flash music videos often based around misheard lyrics to Japanese songs. Although the Animutation scene had mostly died out by 2010, Cicierega's influence on internet culture only grew, creating icons such as Potter Puppet Pals, Brodyquest, and the Mouth albums. He has also had a long musical career under the name Lemon Demon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hyakugojyuuichi!!!, a Flash Animated video by Neil Cicierega.","title":"Hyakugojyuuichi!!","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
