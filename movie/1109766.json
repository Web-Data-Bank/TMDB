The “landscape” that I was looking at through the window became my home, my living space. It was also a kind of calendar, a watch: the passage of time, the passing of the seasons. When I left, I made this film to physically keep with me images, details, lights, colors, textures whose sight and existence were essential to me. I filmed static shots by inserting blacks of varying duration between them. I superimposed different shots six times on the same film, changing their duration and that of the blacks. Each layer therefore has its own rhythm determined in advance. In the end, the series of images fit together like segments of memory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lVwPKqwzeU0EaRbmnhzHU3YBvWj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quattro Stagioni","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
