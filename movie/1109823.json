When I released my c.d. Globe Notes a musician friend said it reminded him of a trip to Bali as a child being transported, half asleep, half dreaming, part awake, through the Balinese  countryside at night by bicycle rickshaw. The audio is from a recording of my live soundtrack performance for the silent film 'Legong' that I performed for Across Asia Film Festiva at the MAXXI in Rome June 2014.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bBEO32BXVPHZLVeUC5CUD1F0mHV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking in Bali","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
