It is not because most of the images of the film show dancing, but because the film seeks for the relationship between movements. The images recorded by video cameras were transformed to films, and the films became my material for this film. I tried to read the possibility of movement from stationary motions in each frame with stationary pictures. Then I connected and related them with movement when finding new relationship. This film is a dance film in that it tries to make images of the implicit meanings of symbolic and abstract movements in dancing and the emotions and memories of dancers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fizYN5L8YLzoV4EzxejmEFRp9Pb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Squash Blossom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
