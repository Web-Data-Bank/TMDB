A roving photographer stumbles upon the hidden camp and starts to take pictures. He is caught and summarily executed but the photos make it back to Washington. The CIA decide to send in an elite team of jungle warfare commandos, the Phantom Raiders, to establish whether Marshall is a POW or has gone bad. But another element has been added to this dangerous game. One of the Phantom Raiders is Marshall's son. Now he must come face to face with the enigma that was his father. The Phantom Raiders is a non-stop film of explosive action, with enough mayhem to leave you breathless.","popularity":1.026,"poster_path":"/cWvLHYFveqz6xTo4ZtZMkJ71euA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12741,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silver Star Film Corporation","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Way In.
