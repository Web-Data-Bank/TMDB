The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people. War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States. The loyalists of the Union in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the Constitution. They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South, who advocated for states' rights in order to uphold slavery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":140213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Encyclopedia Brittanica Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Civil War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
