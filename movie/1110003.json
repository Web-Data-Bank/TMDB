Images of a wandering young girl are alternated with those of a man's corpse in front of an industrial landscape. The man's corpse is a metaphor of the worker forced to work dehumanizing hours. The girl, on the other hand, is the symbol of innocence. This is Luginbühl's accusation directed at a passive and powerless society. However, hope is represented in the final sequences, where Luginbühl's child, Cecilia, is shown as the embodiment of future generations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k6URjYYEKwb6c85p3dr73QKdsi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Senza Seguito Senza Seguito","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
