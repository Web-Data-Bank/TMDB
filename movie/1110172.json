Schmidt (lyrics) and Harry Bannink (music) from 1971. Two fairies guide the life of young Frans. The good fairy wishes him that he will become a decent man, with a good job and an exemplary family. The evil fairy wishes him bad luck. Her goal is to make the boy as unhappy as possible. Both bring twists and turns in the boy's life. They accompany his life in different guises, as a teacher, as a cashier, as a customer in a shop, as a psychiatrist, as aunts at a reception. Their fight continues until morals begin to scramble. Because what is actually still good and what is really bad?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wOxHeEaeyGh91CamUOzRyziEVVH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29459,"logo_path":"/el8phAL6Xa6vXvvaQNiELmEOgx8.png","name":"VARA","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1973-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En nu naar bed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
