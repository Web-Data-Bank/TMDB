He speaks to the camera, or records a commentary on the images he is filming.  For a month, Jan Peters tries to reflect on different themes, and events sometimes come to upset his plans.  A quasi-police investigation in Belgium interferes with an intimate relationship; technical problems of all kinds (sound, image, light, film development, automobile mechanics) force the filmmaker to invent other solutions; a debate between filmmakers on the theme of the power of images turns into burlesque; artist friends want to contribute to the film that is being made.  Thus, day after day, a film is built. Some things are planned, others are not.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uwIXGwi7qb4elfq8AIeQ5v9dzeI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NOVEMBRE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
