Micah doesn't understand why his boyfriend won't come out of the closet in a city as liberal as New York City. Jess' days of chasing after men come to an end after finding the right one, while thirty-something Leia can't quite exorcise the ghosts of lover's past. David tries to maintain a long-distance relationship while fighting for his dreams. And Alejandro's spiritual search is curtailed by his partner's sexual cravings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xy9QEkV4MHL7sKWujZZxVNgx9Ia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's a Match","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
