Set in a women’s inpatient recovery center in Charleston, WV, Her Hope Haven is a place where women are given a chance to get their kids back, their dignity back, stay out of jail, and stay alive.  Their stories are more complex than only their addiction. Against the odds of societal expectations and the money-making business of recovery, the women seek redemption through small stories of levity, euphoria, and heartbreak. The women persevere through working together, and at times against one another, to keep their sobriety as they build bonds with one another during the hardest time of their lives. It's not about the addiction, it’s about the recovery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rtYPzbb70smc7c07VQawOMVa8hB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not about the addiction, it's about the recovery.","title":"Her Hope Haven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
