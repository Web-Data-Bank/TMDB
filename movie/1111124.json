He has also been called a monster. In this thought-provoking program, he faces his critics and discusses his ideas on euthanasia, abortion, and infanticide. The program follows his worldwide tour of lectures and encounters, including case conferences and a trip to Austria, where most of his family was killed in the Holocaust. A range of commentators consider his utilitarian stance and its impact on public policy, including Wesley J. Smith, a bioethicist and attorney with the International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide; Raimond Gaita, professor of moral philosophy at London University; and Harold T. Shapiro, former president of Princeton University, where Dr. Singer teaches.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Singer: A Dangerous Mind","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
