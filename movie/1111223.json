As one of the 14 highest peaks in the world, Shishapangma peak rises over 8000 meters. Jean-Christophe defies the merciless conditions of the Himalayan winter. Without oxygen and exposed to extreme cold, Jean-Christophe, aware of the objective danger, is determined to achieve this long-held dream by reaching the summit by the magnificent British South West face course of 1982, with a new course on the first 1000 meters. He will reach the summit on December 11, some, like the Pole Krzysztof Wielicki, challenge him for the first. Jean-Christophe will be very upset and some of his relatives will be worried to see him then lock himself into an increasingly obstinate quest, some of whom were already guessing the outcome.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jSXJJdNP07FOazGUyQwP2PP9P19.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128792,"logo_path":"/eeK03jLoeZCxgD6ML7HYT1u9NJ9.png","name":"A ProPos Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":197489,"logo_path":"/vzBxI0yXqUYXApQZD7QdGoFJxfD.png","name":"Lafaille Communication","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shishapangma, Un Solo En Hiver","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
