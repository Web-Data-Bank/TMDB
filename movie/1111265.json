Being in the environment of martial law, his family and career were destroyed overnight due to the flaws of judicial judgment. As the vindicator with the longest period of unjust imprisonment in Taiwan's history, Su was constantly dragged down by the injustice, together with his family. The lives of his wife and four children were turned upside down by this tragedy, forcefully changing their goal of life into \"the reversal of Su's injustice case\". The seemingly peaceful not-guilty justice buries the family's choice of life, with all these hidden costs that judicial compensation can never pay off, casting shadows over S and his family for a whole lifetime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wkArjRl74cgWLewbwv8iPVMNya2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Can the Dust Alight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
