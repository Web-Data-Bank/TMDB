Typical family portrait. Family members gathered lively at the table to eat and chat-they talked about other people enthusiastically. They continue to give solutions and even criticise the troubles encountered by other people's families. Some people eat quietly, like an outsider. None of them ever watched themselves.  In this family gathering, sudden incidents have unexpectedly caused tension among family members, and they must also face this cruel fact.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y1Em7awf2BYGSb8xIP3KFB8CMN4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Dinner","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
