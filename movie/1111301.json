Whatever the case may be, watch this film and get introduced to new ways of hiring talent. Or should that be confused? In what starts out like a slickly-produced infomercial, we watch HR rep Miyagawa (Mqeno Tomoya) of JobLink Inc. show the benefits of outsourcing the task of hiring new employees to a recruitment agency but after his neat little infomercial  finishes, a neat twist happens and we are left wondering who is hiring and who is being hired! Just in time for the job hunting season comes the latest work from satire specialist Sakashita Yuichiro whose gentle but merciless twist on the interview process will leave anyone who has Linkedin, Zoomed, or dealt with HR to say Hello to Work with a wry smile.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i25cvQQxjrLFDv2ZyorYmWPUAnQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outsourcing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
