This is true not only inside the screen of individual cuts, but also in the direction of the entire time axis. The time that flows here is a cinematic time that was newly created using the time that flowed when Mr. Kazufumi Kobayashi created a stag pattern out of paper. If we say that time is a function of motion and space, then this can be rephrased as cinematic motion and cinematic space generated by the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jv35RLn87YDVqoEMe0hpuCxZG3v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entomologist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
