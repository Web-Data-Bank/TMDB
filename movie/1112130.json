The results lie buried, untouched for the past 40 years; a treasure hidden from public view. In 2011, Evelyn Forget, discovered the data and for the first time ever analyzed the findings. They reveal the incredible success of the project and have done nothing short of sparking the movement to revive a social policy that has the potential to reinvent our social fabric. Eric, Susie, Betty and Clark were participants in the pilot and take us on an emotional ride to understand the profound ways that Basic Income improved their lives. Each story brings to life the complexities of our social fabric with grounded, down to earth examples revealing the flaws in our existing system; they will make you question your complacency of our economy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eRTeqjVhHPF23SNjACRwZuvSDAZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Truth Be Told","origin_country":""},{"id":197674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dream BIG Collective","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Manitoba Story: A Basic Income Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
