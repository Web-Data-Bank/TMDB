This film is there to ignite debate about what it means to be human and what happens when we lose our compassion for our fellow humans. In Battle is the story of two soldiers who are literally thrown into a situation that none would count on. How do you react when coming face to face with the enemy? A place where language and countries divide us, Life and Death in the balance. When barriers of language and country dissolve we are all human, and that makes us the same.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2sWT2NquN7Hk2Hw8lRG3crhy03x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Battle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
