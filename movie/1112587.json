From the 1950s to the 1980s, René Desmaison achieved a large number of \"firsts\". A specialist in normal routes (west face of Les Drus, Pilier du Freyney, Shroud...), he experienced a tragedy at the Grandes Jorasses, where his exceptional resistance allowed him to survive against all logic. He is the first to claim the practice of the mountain as a high level sport. A man of contrasts, his apparent strength hides great shyness and an unalterable enthusiasm despite the years. Beyond mountaineering, it is the spirit of adventure that has always inhabited him. A whole life devoted to mountaineering.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cPKiKiCPZiUmpCGiumnmfuKABuv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22123,"logo_path":"/zPTy6QDAlCKGeAALZoFEL3QAlut.png","name":"TF1","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":22642,"logo_path":"/gqFSMOsv68FkYalHrKbUvq3pGwh.png","name":"Ina","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":173548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Soleil","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Conquérants De l'Impossible : Portrait De René Desmaison","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
