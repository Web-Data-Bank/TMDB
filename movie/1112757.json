They gained notoriety with a loyal following in the Boston music scene, and beyond. The quartet was no different than any other talentless, self-deprecating, beer-swilling, girl-chasing lunkheads with guitars. It wasn't about money. Catching a girl's eye, a free round of drinks, or simply completing a song in unison were their rewards. Fans and fellow bands in Massachusetts look fondly on the decades of positive ripple effects their presence (still to this day) has on the local music scene. This documentary is a labor of love by family and friends, crafted as a tribute to the Dogmatics' late co-founder and bassist Paul O'Halloran. See how the band came into being in the early 1980s, rising out of a pocket of musical talent in the South Shore area near Boston. At its core, this is a story of brothers - by both blood and bond.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l9MbAdER5s5sYCaLfPwkt32M9iV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They were Boston's house band","title":"The Dogmatics: A Dogumentary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
