Ansari shares, “Expressing her thoughts on discrimination and inequality, Forough described Iranian women’s untold suffering. In a letter dated January 2, 1956, Forough wrote, ‘My wish is for Iranian women to be free and equal to men. I am fully aware that my sisters in this country suffer from men’s injustices, and I use half of my art to articulate their pain and anguish.’ Forough’s poetry symbolizes a woman imprisoned by ancient traditions and seeking the light.”  Ansari’s film, Another Birth, is titled after  Farrokhzad writing, Another Birth, published in 1963.","popularity":0.889,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Birth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
