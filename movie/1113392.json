Shown from the movement of two fox shooters. The toffee is shot and the greens are taken from the spruce. The Icelandic fox or melrakki has been native to this country for millennia and probably since the end of the Ice Age. It is expected that images of the disposal of the animals may affect children and vulnerable persons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6r5AbwkZvHRlvCXzEJL2WBc87Or.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fox Makes a Den in the Scree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
