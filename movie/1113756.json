Chuck and Mary Ann, both married, are having an affair. Chuck gives Mary Ann a fancy necklace, giving her a key and telling her that he will put the necklace in the corresponding locker in Union Station. Mary Ann is to give the key to her husband claiming she found it, and he will presumably get the necklace and give it to her. She does this, but her husband brings her back the box with a cheap pocket watch in it instead. Mary Ann blames Chuck and calls him angrily, claiming she knows his game—meanwhile, Mary Ann’s husband has given the necklace to a woman he’s having an affair with, along with the key to fool her husband.  Locations include establishing shots of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Marina Towers, as well as one short scene shot presumably in Union Station.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AefQy7YxowwMFJZpJCY9xjBxEOy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Games for Married Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
