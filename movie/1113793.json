His only escape from his solitary world is the company of his aging, legless parents, who live in garbage bins, and his shuffling servant, Clov, who is at his beck and call, and who, like a dog, comes when whistled for. The only thing left for Hamm is to wait for the inevitable end. A pinnacle of Beckett’s characteristic raw minimalism, Endgame is a pure and devastating distillation of the human essence in the face of approaching death. “Nothing is funnier than unhappiness” invokes Nell, which summarizes the tragicomic nature of this timeless play.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":"/1uqWcnWoHemd0RuljaxbzqGNBqp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145741,"logo_path":null,"name":"Irish Repertory Theatre","origin_country":""},{"id":197940,"logo_path":null,"name":"The League of Live Stream Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endgame","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
