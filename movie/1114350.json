What is digital safe space for queers, feminists, LGBTQIA+, and those who seek out nostalgia in popular culture, as well as its connections to social movements and practices of freedom and for creative reflection? Does digital safe space always mean digital brave space due to the contemporary changing status of women, gender, and sexual minorities in the U.S. and the popular figures and forms of creative expression that might, at one period, help define these groupsâ€™ struggles publicly, but, in another, participate in discourses that further their harm? How does a space of concentration, music, and visualization produce an experience of nostalgic transport while not censoring or erasing the presence of figures that might now be considered too problematic to acknowledge as part of queer, trans, and feminist cultures for past acts of support?","popularity":0.694,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concentration: Ambient Sound & Aesthetic Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
