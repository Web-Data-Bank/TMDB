Naturally shy, he prefers to act rather than speak, defining a modern style of governance that has earned him great popularity from the start. Married to a young computer engineer, he asserted a policy of liberalization of morals and even made a critical review of the period of repression led by his father during the years of lead. However, he faces opposition from conservatives, which leads to the election of the Islamist PJD (Party of Justice and Development) as head of government, following the Arab Spring of 2011.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qS12iUlhb5ZmnIsSwi6jmZj5KBx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illégitime Défense","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mohammed VI - The Limits of Power","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
