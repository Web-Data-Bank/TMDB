As he lies there, we witness the passage of time on the islands.  At first there is peace and time seems to move slowly.  Only the music and the occasional movements of the man indicate the passage of time.  Finally a man carrying water passes by, followed by other people representative of times past: market vendors, peasants, the red-cheeked god dancing at a matsuri (festival).  But as the film progresses, the islands prove to be the meeting place of many cultures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":174718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Lotus","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":130475,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dr. Movie","origin_country":""},{"id":13412,"logo_path":"/jLBwPLrniN24UV46WMtNTCTyd8c.png","name":"IMAGICA","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"琉球王国 – Made in Okinawa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
