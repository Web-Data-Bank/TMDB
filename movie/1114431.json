Since the beginning of time, nay, since before time existed at all, there was the Black Goose a.k.a. Old Mother Hubbard a.k.a. The Old Lady Who Swallowed the Fly. And she mourned the last Multiverse, her lover. She sang this new Multiverse out of her longing, and she vomited up the Clown Guardians whose stories of love and revenge are explored by clowns across the Multiverse during April Fools.  On this day, clowns everywhere get married. And so we present to you, a traditional Clown Wedding not just of Zigzag and Humpty D. Goose, but of the Clown Guardians.  For love is the foundation of all creation!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zN6sxRDdnqcKlru6K5ad1jjG0ZY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"April Fools - A Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
