The old man feels that it is important to guard it from various encroachers, and even though he has a better house and his son's family waiting for him, he chooses to stay in this broken down one where even electricity and power supply has been blocked. It starts becoming apparent that there is a role reversal, as if the house is not for him, but he is the one trapped in the house bound by an unexplained duty towards guarding it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3c7n6bUdKgHw2CP95nbnkD0rca1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FOOL'S GOLD","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
