Equal parts personal and political, historical and imagined, May 35 rests on a cinematic score of aural ebbs and flows, and mixes Dahwenâ€™s own words spoken and displayed news-ticker style with text generated from image-recognition software over a visual examination of Tiananmen Square as an intersection of history, tourism, regulation, and surveillance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"May 35","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
