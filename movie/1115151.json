It is a film of my two dogs - Chippy in the foreground and Audrey behind - through the windowpane. Chippy was upset with me for filming without his consent and for refusing to let him inside for the two minutes I spent filming. The film is an experiment in \"perverted formats\" (a medium filtered through another).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9TKPgLa3fWHhx0jG33wMNRloxzb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dog at Window","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
