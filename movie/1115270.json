Safarian takes a personal look at the events, their cinematic presentation, and the concept of revolution in general: his work coincided with the “Arab Spring” in Egypt and Tunisia. Safarian recognized the same gestures, behavior, and signs: “Crowds fill the streets, burning tires, cars, and buildings; fists, slogans, guns: This is nothing more than a revolution that repeats itself over and over again.” “Conversations with the Revolution” sets out to fathom what the photos and films are really about, what they show exactly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conversation With The Revolution گفتگو با انقلاب","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
