Hernando is a man in his forties who is determined to find his aunt Graciela, the only living relative whose testimony will allow him to inherit a substantial amount of money. On the contrary Alejandra, Hernando's wife, thinks that no money should justify the risk of putting themselves in the midts of a 'red zone'.
