The film does not have any reference to time or place. Its approach is timeless with a universal visual language. However, the choice of location and costume is very intentional. Richomme believes the young people featured have been forced to concern themselves with worries beyond their years and this is portrayed in the kitsch and dated style, look and feel, which harnesses a sense of nostalgia and anachronism.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/fHI4Atxr9kPGALfN2tpbXoBZ03S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everything's going so fast that I'm kind of not ready for it","title":"Youth","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
