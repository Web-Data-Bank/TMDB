Through video that mixes parallel visual narratives, Ulu Kupu follows a “Labor Hula”, a performance of harvesting plants/materials from the 'āina (land): hala which is used for weaving; wauke, which is used to create kapa or tapa, a textile; and hau which is also used as a textile or decorative fiber. This dance with the materials of the land is further expanded through the performance of a dancer, wearing the materials on their body and dancing in a wahi pana (sacred place) as well as in a grove of hau trees.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tfai9rPFF4g2WQXf5OC5PN5ATVL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ulu Kupu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
