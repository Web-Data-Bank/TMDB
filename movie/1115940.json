Water pumping stations strategically placed throughout the city serve as the front line of defense. The film portrays a day in the life of the DPS 6 pump station (formerly the biggest pump station in the world) through the eyes of Chasity Hunter, a teenager from the surrounding neighborhood, who interviews geographer Richard Campanella of Tulane University, geomorphologist Denise Reed of the Water Institute for the Gulf, and pumping station operator James Taylor in an effort to understand the ways New Orleans coexists with water.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Station 15","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
