After several years without any contact, Luke is eager for a reunion. Bewildered, Adam sets off to meet up with his childhood mate. What follows is a sequence of interactions with Luke's family members, overlaid with a drug and alcohol binge. As the day progresses through a series of funny, sad and violent clashes it becomes clear that the stranger has little in common with the people he has been thrown in with. What all these characters do share though is an intense desire to be something more than what they are.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iXpEEb7jskQ5gLmmApq7Z7QC9S4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accent Film Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome Stranger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
