Both words come from “Arkhé”, the Greek word for “origin”.  In the ruins of buildings, lost forever by earthquakes, as in the depth of the archives, we dig.  What happened the morning of the big earthquake? The morning of September 19th 1985 is fading away in our memories. These recordings have never been seen.

He dug and suffered until he could no longer see.","popularity":4.528,"poster_path":"/dIVhM6UTAmEy8n7FITVudqEhg7J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194243,"logo_path":"/fmX3vUQsZIncHOeLJSeBcAqVyCu.png","name":"N+","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2023-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the ruins of buildings, lost forever by earthquakes, as in the depth of the archives, we dig.","title":"Arkhé","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
