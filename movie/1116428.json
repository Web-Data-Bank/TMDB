Given the ongoing legacy of cruelty, two individuals decided to stop this practice, rescue the bears still in captivity and create a sanctuary where they can heal and live in safety for the rest of their lives. This is the story of the founders of WILDLIFE SOS-Kartik Satyanarayan and Geeta Seshamani. Early on, they realized they had to help the people whose livelihood had depended for so long on the Dancing Bear trade--finding jobs for the men, empowering the women and providing education for the sometimes exploited children. Saving the Dancing Bears is more than a wildlife rescue film: in the process of saving the bears, they also saved a human community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rOOJw6QYr2qjLvvjCKLNpPboyf9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saving the Dancing Bears","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
