You might know her from Comedy Central, Netflix, or as Carnival Cruise line's first openly gay performer. Maybe you've seen her viral TikToks and have been waiting for this hour long comedy special for years. To you she might just be the lesbian comedian and the host of the We're Having Gay Sex & Chosen Family podcasts. This is her debut special, so she really came to introduce herself to the world as a stand up comedian, and nothing else. Of course, LGBT issues will be covered, but there is way more. We get into emotional eating, deconstructing pro life arguments, feminism, women's rights, and what the supreme court should have done, dating and relationships, and even a little bit of good old fashion small talk.","popularity":1.408,"poster_path":"/6ipV6GrFzntdM66EnPe4hEVdfnP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashley Gavin: Live in Chicago","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
