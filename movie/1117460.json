People believe that the dead can rest in peace only when they are buried in the earth. Otherwise, their souls will be lost and become wandering ghosts, never to reincarnate. The place where cattle laid comes from an ancient Book called Jin, which means a geomantic treasure place where people can rest in peace.  In modern days, the Reform of Funeral and Interment began, and many stories of conflict with faith occurred. Old Li and the Fool’s journey took place in the autumn of the year when the burial was changed to cremation.","popularity":1.029,"poster_path":"/6tWVOc6G2MUaTnPaifuoTLnkunR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shanghai Film Academy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2023-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the Cattle Laid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
