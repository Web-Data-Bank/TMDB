The roving camera intimately examines the disregarded plastics and thriving weeds that decorate the space while continually auto-focusing, creating a fractured journey around the temporary wasteland. On the soundtrack, passing cars, trains, people and other sounds of the space intermingle with semi-musical textures and field recordings, situating it somewhere between being part of the urban environment, and existing in a world of its own, a colorful landscape scattered with fascinating minutiae. Area by Road doesn’t pass judgement on the pollution inherent in the space, it just acknowledges its troubling beauty: \"...all land, no matter what has happened to it, has over it a grace, an absolutely persistent beauty.\" —Robert Adams","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hXUQDCCXSYWWZeXxC35ccM3pnr0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Area by Road","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
