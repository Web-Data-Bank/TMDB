We see a kid who’s becoming more and more clear and a confused mom who can barely keep up with him. Creating space for addressing the wrongs, concerns and clichés, this film provides a loving insight into the reality of a kid in transition. It shows the impact that ‘becoming who you are’ has on a family, but at the same time addresses universal themes like growing up, becoming an adult and the art of raising a kid and letting them go.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9pkVq8CXbuU59hXTJ6EUt4JmDxX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(with[out] balls)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
