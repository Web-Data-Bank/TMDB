He orders Dr. Rodriguez and Dr. Garcia to put all afflicted boys in isolation while they work frantically on finding an antidote.\r Of course, as this is St. Samuel's, the two doctors can be relied upon to experiment with a wide range of stimulating - if unorthodox - treatments in their search for a remedy. And, while they do so, the quarantined boys in the school sanatorium show that their illness definitely hasn't affected their sex drives!","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/zgLBwApOQzXF0SzgRjzNEuKuB8p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117950,"logo_path":"/vVAhq0lQET4PJCy8KgZVtblakze.png","name":"Original Teen Boy Video","origin_country":"CO"},{"id":198713,"logo_path":null,"name":"Twink Academy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor's Orders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
