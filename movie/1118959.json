Ieva Epnere came to Laidi in autumn 2021 as part of a creative residency to learn about the history and stories of the parish and to find inspiration for a new artwork. During the residency, the idea of collaborating with the school's theatre group was born, and together with choreographer Elīna Gediņa the movement performance Laidu leģendas (eng. Tales of Laidi) was created. Parallel to the development of the idea, the artist learned about the decision of the Kuldīga County Council to close the school. The disturbing news prompted Epnere to document the situation. The result is a documentary film spanning all seasons and connecting the everyday life of the school with preparations for a reunion that will also be a farewell.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laidi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
