This is a story about a school that, in a complex and surprising process, changed its face, and became an elitist and luxurious high school that produced successful and dedicated students - to an anarchic and disordered place.  It is a chilling and unbelievable story about a sublime educational vision that has collapsed, about brotherhood, loss of control and maturation, and about the nature of the human soul, in which good and evil, cruelty and kindness, are mixed up.","popularity":2.358,"poster_path":"/yznNkAA70t1MN7irb8Mj1gffPAO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ze'evi-Uzrad","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":200674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yalla Films","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":142771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministry of Culture and Sport","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":116016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kan","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":151490,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Israeli Film Council","origin_country":""},{"id":24477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rabinovich Film Fund Cinema Project","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2023-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Once upon a time there was a school...","title":"Once Upon a School","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
