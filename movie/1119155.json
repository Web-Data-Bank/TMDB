The video, created using the fighting game Soulcalibur, features two players both controlling the character Voldo, using existing in-game animation to have the characters perform a synchronized dance to the song \"Hot in Herre\" by musician Nelly. The result of over a week's full-time preparation and training, the video was conceived after Brandt noticed the character's animations and attacks could be triggered in sync with the beat of a song, and the reactions of onlookers to such a display. While several groups demonstrated interest in showcasing the video, complications arose from the copyright holders whose works were involved in creation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9ygk2gHjqzauTQ6X26Exrjuff3n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance, Voldo, Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
