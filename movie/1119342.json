The war between Russia and Ukraine goes. Among the all Russian republics, Buryatia almost immediately found itself as a region with the highest number of dead military. Funerals and zinc coffins have been coming to Buryatia almost every day since February 24, 2022. The government of Buryatia is counting the heroes, posthumously. This is a reflection film from the stories and thoughts of loved ones of the new \"war heroes\", supplemented by the reality of their life in one of the most depressing regions of Russia. This is scary, but worth to know.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4sUsdanG5L9CHgysx67TCnUC8Lr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warriors of Buryatia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
