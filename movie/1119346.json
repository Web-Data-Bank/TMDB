All hungry for a woman's affection, the men agree to take her in. However, what she doesn't know is that each of the men is coming up with ridiculous ways to have their way with her. A surreal comedy about sexual repression and sexual fantasies, the film mocks the desperate measures people take in the name of sexual gratification. Even though it is an erotic comedy at heart, it is never lewd or exploitative. In fact, like other Cantonese films at the time, the story even ends on a moralistic note as Tam Bing-man's character convinces the pickpocket to turn herself in and mend her ways.","popularity":0.919,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":153122,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hing Fat Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucky Seven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
