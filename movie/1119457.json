Disillusioned with his vocation, Aital dispenses more common sense advice than mystical succour to his clients, whose complaints range from impotence to demonic possession – but he is still haunted by the suspicion that there is something otherworldly at play. Vladimir Munkuev’s witty, humane take on the role of the supernatural in a disenchanted world demonstrates Sakha cinema’s deep concern for native traditions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ndCZcIQZDVqvGZuW0ZJIP57ofdl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aital","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
