Through poems and pop songs, the film brings back memories of their grown-up dates. Having dinner at a restaurant for the first time without parents, or being picked up from her birthday in his Mercedes.  The coming of age film looks at the shaping experiences in which the female body is first subjected to the male gaze, and therefore becomes an object of desire. The protagonist, who is 14 years old at the time of their affair, is pulled towards the sensual experiences of being with this man, and simultaneously feels the danger in these experiences. There’s a sense of dissolution of the self. She uses her intellect to separate and watch over the body she owns, a detachment strategy, whereby the scene appears to us in birds-eye-view. The bird, a raven with a scratch on her beak, accompanies us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sOlADw4XmPkWUliToIpUY8nfVam.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm Just Lying There","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
