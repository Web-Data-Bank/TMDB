A minimal 'painted world' is introduced. A pre-recorded monotonous glitching voice reflects on an everyday experience of memory, wondering why it is so hard to remember things when we want to, and why memories pop up when they do: Reminding us of people we have not seen for some  time, reminding us of the smell of someones sweat, because we heard that song at a house party once.
