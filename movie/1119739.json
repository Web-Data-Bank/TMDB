Built a few years before the revolution, it has a history that reflects the fate of the Russian Orthodox Church in the 20th century. Its walls remember the First World War and two revolutions, the confiscation of church treasures and the restoration of the patriarchate. The film features the builder and first dean of the church of Resurrection, father Johann Kedrov who was persecuted and exiled under the Soviet regime. The parishioners of the church will always remember this man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pIpjRFc7e8ixqEYY0N2W5b4hrlS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Voice of Russia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1995-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The First Dean","title":"The First Dean","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
