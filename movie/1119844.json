On April 22, 2010, the hearing for the revocation of their licenses was held at the office of the Beijing Bureau of Justice. This marked the beginning of a new round of suppression of human rights lawyers.  In recent years, the situation regarding human rights lawyers have worsened. They have been sentenced, sent to Re-education through Labor camps, harassed, kidnapped, followed and beaten, and these malignant events are occurring frequently. As voices of the vulnerable, their channels for fighting for justice have been blocked one after the other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/us15iKYlexoHhSjFwYzU6g7qyMj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disbarment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
