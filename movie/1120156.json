And now, in a rather unusual way, he helps people with disabilities bring back their thirst for life. Kostya Oborin, the film's main character, prepares two disabled men, ATO veterans, for the parachute jump. They've still never skydived, but Kostya persuaded them for a jump as a method of rehabilitation and mind-broadening. The training is not easy, but it's worth it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/grIKFAaTTpf3K0g8cRXVzq5PUap.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was Not Born for War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
