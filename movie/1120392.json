Hedenius was one of the first students at Christer Strömholm's photography school but then dropped out, which was the start of 60 years of persevering film production about life in stillness, vibrant moments and the enchantment of everyday life. Later on she reluctantly let the filmmaker and photographer Fredrik Wenzel into her home, who draws a tender and close portrait of one of the great filmmakers of our time.","popularity":1.279,"poster_path":"/lEFzO1VC1CEBLiUUdZhho5baTnp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2023-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nina Hedenius - ett ögonblick i sänder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
