ITV News' Daniel Hewitt has followed the impact of this crisis for more than a year and examines how it's changed lives across the country. Filmed over the course of the winter, he follows working people battling every day just to stay afloat, shocked by how their circumstances have changed and often unable to see light at the end of the tunnel.","popularity":1.078,"poster_path":"/5Bkn1MZtlpU3k6yXDXysSZOg3KP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life & Debt: Stories from the Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
