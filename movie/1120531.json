It is a portrait of a place where life has a different meaning and time has another pace. In a world that is more and more driven by fast gains by any means, the Hill and its people appear to be one of the last enclaves hidden from time, where man has still a deep connection to nature, his land and animals. Life is simple and rough, the land is imposing its own rules, but people preserve a sense of freedom and serenity almost forgotten by the modern man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bFO2SoiK0biKLdY5NmI69it1phr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2014-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
