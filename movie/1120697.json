In it, he created a powerful allegory on the conflict between Christianity and paganism, good and evil, light and dark, physical passion and spiritual abstinence. This dramatic production by the brilliant German stage director Harry Kupfer marked Daniel Barenboim's appointment as the artistic director of the Berlin State Opera in 1992. The cast is made up of the finest Wagnerian singers of the period, all of whom enjoyed substantial international careers. Barenboim's superb conducting reveals Wagner's multi-layered score in all it's glory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zu4q2ImNPVLKVhkZx1qXTuR7WXM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parsifal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
