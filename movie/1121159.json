This 3D animated video proposes a new version of the fable, where its protagonist is a transgender vixen who, by means of its charms, achieves to attract the otter, unsettling colonial constructions about desire and heterosexuality and allowing to break these paradigms and create new cosmologies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fox and Otter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
