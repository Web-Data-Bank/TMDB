But today, there is no standard; there is no norm. There is only a group of surfers that are going their own way. FIN is an examination of the current state of the art, a time in surfing culture when surfers are compelled to ride whatever they want in order to facilitate a style that suits them best. FIN is a study of the end of one mentality, a look at the current epoch of surfing history, and a celebration of a time in surf culture when what you ride means nothing, but how you ride it means everything.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/llM9HGpsyPBS7IazyuD8hm414Po.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FIN","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
