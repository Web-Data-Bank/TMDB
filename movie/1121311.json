And there’s a lot more sunset grass in our lives than Saint Chapelles or paintings in museums… One film, entirely devoted to what light can do to ordinary stuff, is called Hurrah for Light!” —Ralph Steiner","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hurrah for Light","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
