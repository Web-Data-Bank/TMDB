In addition to dealing with the universal stresses of adolescence, they must also negotiate the tricky territory of blended cultures and quirky family dynamics. This is familiar terrain to both Kashua and Alfi who present the complexities of coming-of-age and co-existence in Israel with a healthy dose of humour and a much, much needed message of hope. TJFF is excited to present four episodes of the series.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kz6B56B6hkpxDtAsIRvvDEw9hHP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madrasa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
