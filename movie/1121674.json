The procession starred the fabulously voluptuous and successful London Hippodrome actress Vera Guedes as Godiva. The film begins with a lingering shot of Godiva, in her flesh-coloured dress, on her horse highlighting her significance in the procession. The remaining extracts lose her as a focus, as the procession is used as a vehicle to exhibit local trade.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":39573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitchell and Kenyon","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1902-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lady Godiva Procession in Coventry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
