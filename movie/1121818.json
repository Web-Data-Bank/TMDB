While politicians, activists, and the media wrestle with the thorny issue of immigration Lives for Sale exposes the painful, rarely seen human side of illegal immigration – especially the growing black market trade in human beings. The documentary also looks at some practical alternatives to these tragic realities. Interviews include immigrants, a \"coyote\" who brings people across the border for money, clerics, activists, and law-enforcement officials.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4cxNYyLhDHxyhMYF681vUxjBGMI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lightfoot Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lives for Sale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
