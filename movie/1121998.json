A \"cantata with radiophonic and theatrical overtones\", it is described by the composer as \"practically an opera of Mother Earth surrounded by her chicks\". It was Stockhausen's first piece composed on principles of modular transposability, and his first musical form to be determined from categories of sensation or perception rather than by numerical units of musical terminology, which marks a significant change in the composer's musical approach from the abstract forms of the 1950s","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uC6mY0UClJHVN0m7w2PWWesWK5w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Momente","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
