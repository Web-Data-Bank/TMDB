At one point, the camera follows him as he ping-pongs across New York attending multiple concerts in one evening. His love for the work of putting on a show shines through as he drags the filmmakers through crowds and backstage so he can chat with artists and crew members. Interspersed with these present-day adventures are looks back on the highlights of Delsener’s career, reflecting his own intense nostalgia. It’s rare that a documentary so completely embodies the personality of its subject.","popularity":3.689,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":89394,"logo_path":"/m1Hku3PhgdsQiPO8uVe7szyrxAb.png","name":"RadicalMedia","origin_country":"US"},{"id":71887,"logo_path":"/hEIju9dZK9SPeaGbo2kFcKbk1fc.png","name":"Heretical Reason Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":106322,"logo_path":null,"name":"Needle's Eye Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Ron Delsener Presents","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
