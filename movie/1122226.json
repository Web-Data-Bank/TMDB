Now the country's favourite dickhead has done something that nobody thought was a good idea, he became a pilot. While most of us were busy giving up on baking in the lockdowns, Tommy aimed for the heavens, taking flying lessons and nailing his first solo flight (well, sort of). You'll hear about this, and other adventures in Pretty Fly For A Dickhead. On stage, Tommy is a perpetual motion machine, constantly working the crowd and landing line after line.","popularity":3.027,"poster_path":"/fnE1BDiBEo4FvxeDPw3KlHDuWFX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82476,"logo_path":"/75OyM9KBYO2rhfsRebvaobIluFP.png","name":"Guesswork Television","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tommy Little: Pretty Fly for A Dickhead","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
