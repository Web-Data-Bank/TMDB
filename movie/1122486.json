The work, dating from 1988, was the first to give a voice to disadvantaged individuals whose very existence had been a taboo. In addition to unpicking the tragic personal stories of drug users just surviving on the fringes of late Kádár-era society, another important purpose of the film was that it investigated the ‘official’ side of the problem as well. It is evident from what those interviewed had to say that meaningful steps were put off for decades by the fact that the whole issue of drugs was a forbidden subject in Hungary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ixumml82v8bZ4Ru140rpkNotePh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Objektív Filmstúdió Vállalat","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1988-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Floating Free","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
