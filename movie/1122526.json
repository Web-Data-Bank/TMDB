Bruce Hornsby and Vince Welnick’s presence and musical contributions reinvigorated and revitalized the Grateful Dead, and the inspiration of the Dead's playing was palpable. On a Saturday night in front of 60,000 fans, the Dead played what is often considered one of the greatest shows of the Bruce-Vince era, up there with the second Giants Stadium show from a few days earlier. The Soldier field show was filled with favorites, including “Shakedown Street,”“Brown-Eyed Women,” “Playing In The Band,” “Terrapin Station,” and “Dark Star.” From the original six-camera video feed that appeared on the stadium's big screens and the pristine soundboard audio, Chicago 6/22/91 is an incredible performance start-to-finish.","popularity":3.604,"poster_path":"/wHJzKJ8zYZSqiFCZknb8tGFf7oR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Grateful Dead Meet-Up At The Movies 2023","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
