A proxy for the Vietnam War is staged in a supermarket, and the Confessor, or one of the subjects he has surreptitiously monitored, dies amid an assault of mass media imagery.  \"...an American underground effort by Edward Bergman and Alan Soffin shown in the Film Market. Despite some portentous attempts at structure, this is closer to a collection of shorts than a feature, and often amateurish shorts at that, pivoted around the general theme of media overload (another version of Future Shock?)\" - Jonathan Rosenbaum","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confessor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
