Parts of you that you didn't know are energizing and your deepest desires are being fulfilled. Voices around, voices within, you fall silent trying to save yourself. Allowing the mind to calm down for a while.Rapid heartbeats, hallucinations and deep breaths.Sadness, falling, nostalgia, desire, remembrance, loss.  The touch, the tenderness and the absence of them. How long does a dream last? A little flight, a hovering in the unconscious, before the final fall into the conscious. A moment when everything is possible, almost tangible, almost real.  \"","popularity":8.788,"poster_path":"/qajoviqcfUrcR8sP6gokDBx6xnb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178474,"logo_path":"/AvEu3FUJOiul65MTD74MQmQckQi.png","name":"Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2023-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A hovering in the unconscious, before the final fall into the conscious.","title":"HOVERING","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
