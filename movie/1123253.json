The Japanese army wants to force resistance leader Cheung (Bow Fong) to appear by capturing his family. Cheung's wife dies and, despite the protection by the nurse Yeung (Chu Hung) and other villagers, Cheung's daughter is captured. In the end Cheung's subordinate Lee Fu (Jiang Han) regroups with the resistance and saves the day, defeating the enemy and rescuing everyone. This film clearly references wartime productions in the mainland of China, with elements such as the Japanese taking hostages, resistance guerilla fighters, and the contrast between ‘heroes' and ‘villains' made obvious through camerawork and make-up designs. Street scenes shot in Macau merge seamlessly with studio scenes to recreate northern Chinese towns. War epics were not a strong suit of Hong Kong cinema. This film takes inspirations from Euro-American spy films and pays attention to character development and the mise-en-scène.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":71847,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feng Huang Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1967-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Child Hunt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
