In the heat of some humiliating sex in exchange with his ‘Daddy’-type landlord, Pat  is embarrassed to get a call from his estranged sister, Amber, letting him know their  abusive, homophobic father has died.  After his landlord gives him an ultimatum for the rent, Pat decides to journey home to  collect his inheritance money.  Upon his arrival, Pat is enraged to learn his sister has been left the entire estate and  all he has inherited is a lousy measly silver key.  Worse still, it can only be used in his Dad’s garage/man-cave, a space he has always  felt alienated from.  He fails to realize that the key holds a long-held family secret - his real inheritance.  What the key unlocks will shock Pat to his core and drive him further into suicidal  depression - will he overcome it? Or he will he succumb to his instinct to harm himself?  Who can save him?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l0K2PVJusEOkzjtBdB1ihGep4ey.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199526,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miramar Creative Centre","origin_country":""},{"id":199527,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Crosby Allen-Jennings Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2022-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When his homophobic father dies, a hopeless broke gay artist journeys home to fight his estranged sister for the inheritance.","title":"Life's a Drag","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
