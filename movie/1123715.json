What we found there was an amplified materiality. . . . The Heygate became as a crucible that concentrates our mind in its materials. You will notice in this film a complete absence of \"the figure,\" an absence of protagonist. Instead we summoned an intensely subjective presence between \"us\" and the Heygate. In observing the Heygate, in loving the Heygate we generated an energetic interaction which we recorded. In other words our combined perception of Heygate weaving in and out of consciousness is a game of \"looking and not looking,\" stimulating and collapsing the wave function at will.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4MsAqL1FScB5HISYgRmOcCOKTvy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heygate for Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
