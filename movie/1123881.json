So I went to check the wonderful world of bootlegs. But it turns out there's very, very little that has excellent sound quality. So I gathered all of the best sounding stuff and made a live album out of it. Five out of the nine songs come from a show broadcast by the French TV show \"Pop2,\" so that's what I'm calling this. But about half of the total length comes from other sources.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fx7mbF3nx4vwyZgTwPsGFwMcL04.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Gang - Pop2, L'Olympia, Paris,","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
