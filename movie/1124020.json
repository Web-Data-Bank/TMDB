The inadvertent physical touch and eye contact touched one of the boy. In the game after game, he had a beautiful imagination from this indescribable feeling, and felt that all faint touches seemed to be dancing. However, it's just that in this game where gays obsess over heterosexual men, he finally has to face the moment when the dance ends. This film is conceived of the \"straight crush\" plot in which young gays are obsessed with heterosexual men in their exploration of sexual orientation. It combines a variety of touch-related art mediums, trying to use the concepts of touch and gaze to describe the common experiences and memories of gay growth.","popularity":14.69,"poster_path":"/vmNFNPcX8XYZ0dXoBV0cHk2QLiH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confusion of the Afternoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
