Lowers his head. Damn. He is standing on a mine. If he moves, it will explode. How will he get through this ? He doesn't have much time left... He hesitates. Waits. He's exhausted. It's time for the last call. He dials a number into his mobile phone, hoping to hear a little voice. That voice, at this precise moment in time, seems to be the most precious thing. His daughter. One last time. One last wish. No response. The repetition of the dial tone. When suddenly... A hostile voice answers him. His ultimate battle begins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sRy62Fc2dWs38hQ4CZbNs18Nv6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Call","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
