Dressed in black, members of this subculture converge at Gothic dance balls, listen to Death Metal and flock to festivals. Their outfit ranges from the Victorian romantic with ruffles and frills to the lacquer-and-leather-look. Provocation or a philosophy of life? Religious circles call the Gothics “graveyard vandals”; fashion designers draw inspiration from the skull-and-crossbones look. The documentary film portrays the diversity of this scene and the peaceful, respectful people who have chosen to take a closer look at death and mortality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kP7vld9VHo721eyRqd1TOH97NAu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gothic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
