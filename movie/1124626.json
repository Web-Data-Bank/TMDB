All by art of undulatory phenomena and as a result of a vibrating plaque, a top of a subwoofer and a frequency generator called Chladni Plaque. All this illusional close-up of particle movement is fueled by an out-of-scope machinery in charge of translating sound into movement, a visual language indebted with the mechanics of fluids and particle movement in wave phenomena. Hence, we encounter a floating screen; we access a reflection in which bodies merge like ground in diminutive particle, atomizing it into an iridescent mantle of dust.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c47hHH13hBJ3QEVFEAt5oIK3GGm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hearing Forms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
