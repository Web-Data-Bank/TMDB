This film tells the story of the mammoth project, supervised by Roy Stryker of the Farm Security Administration and later made part of the Office of War Information. Viewers will encounter the poignant, iconic images and personal challenges of photographers Gordon Parks, Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Marion Post Wolcott, and other visionaries. Interviews with Parks, Louise Rosskam, and Bernarda Shahn—wife of painter and photographer Ben Shahn—shed light on a period in which artistic innovation formed a response to social and economic despair.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jTeHl653noOPtwHBjBoNJqbLlQO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Documenting the Face of America: Roy Stryker and the FSA/OWI Photographers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
