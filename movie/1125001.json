He carries with him a terrifying secret.  Ibsen’s Ghosts, one of the greatest plays ever written, is a devastating moral thriller in which ideas of love, duty and family are mercilessly put to the test.  This spectacular new version, written and directed by one of Ireland’s leading playwrights, Mark O’Rowe, grabs you by the throat from the outset and refuses to let go – all the way to its electrifying climax.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":58912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Landmark Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
