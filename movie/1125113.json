It links his childhood to the adult world into which he’s thrown despite himself, as well as the dreams and nightmares of the Chilean people’s painful past. The fog, haunted by the memory of Pinochet’s dictatorship, blends these worlds into a poem where the changing winds blow, at times fanning the flames of the youth’s revolutionary hopes and at others preventing them from escaping traced out destinies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eso que nos lleva","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
