Dozens of Armenian asylum seekers trying to survive while waiting for their application to be considered. They left behind them a country whose people have settled around the world for over a hundred years ... A country all described as desert, abandoned by its inhabitants, emptied of its life. Forced stillness, impotence, they live in an in-between space: between two countries, between two lives. In a time and abstract space, made of nothing, where their life escapes them completely. By the shore, they float in limbo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":102821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmographe Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":199750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those from the Shore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
