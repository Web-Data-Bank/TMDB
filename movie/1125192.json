Before filming, Jovanović lived in a university town for several months, researching the life of students. The then head of the Academy, Vjekoslav Afrić, was shocked by the truth about the university city at the internal screening of the film. He addresses Jovanović verbally and aggressively, threatening him with a criminal report. Although he has never been to the university town, he accuses Jovanović of directing the students' lives and says that he will be held accountable for that. Afrić formed two commissions with the task of visiting the university town the next day and confirming Afrić's claims. The commissions determined that the film faithfully portrayed life in the university town. Despite this, Afrić insisted that a report be filed against Jovanović to the State Security Service (successors of OZNa and UDBA).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"University Town","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
