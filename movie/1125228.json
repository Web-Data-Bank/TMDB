In parallel, the film shows the monument of Edvard Kardelj, the main Orwellian ideologue of Titoism in the center of Ljubljana. The workers surrounding Kardelj are beings without articulated faces. Kardelj has the only human face. They all go to the so-called happy future. The monument confirms in an astonishing and perverse way that the so-called self-governing socialism produced a mass of impersonal and authoritarian individuals in the crowd, which the so-called communist elites rule unscrupulously by manipulating the feelings of the masses \"about a better future\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dunav Film","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"},{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Created Systems","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
