It was achieved through interviews in which people talk about the world of work - a world of unfreedom, necessity and coercion in which they do not see themselves as individuals. Painting enables them to escape from everyday banal reality into the world of beauty and freedom. So-called ordinary people of various occupations have a built-in awareness of the problematic nature of humanism in the modern world. Through interviews, the film articulates a story, kind of - it is a vision of the apocalyptic end of modern civilization that has no higher, metaphysical meaning. At the same time, there is hope that after the collapse of modern civilization, a society of meaning, love and freedom can be created.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nnsIv4B7TcWSsjqGVFcf4iNLWL2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29683,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.F.S.
