A few hours before his despondent son’s graduation party, alpha stockbroker Richard (Julian Garner, Underbelly: Vanishing Act) has his bank accounts drained by his “findom” mistress, Princess Paige (Asha Boswarva, Lambs of God). That’s a (usually) non-sexual dominatrix hired by wealthy men to spend their money and humiliate them. Frantic farce and raw drama follow as Richard attempts to gather a mountain of cash that will prevent his unsuspecting wife Kelly (Felicity Price, Last King of the Cross) from discovering the truth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A married Sydney stockbroker with a financial domination fetish has one day to save his life from ruin in this acidic Aussie comedy from writer-director Dane McCusker.","title":"The Big Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
