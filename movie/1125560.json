The artist is calm like an empty suit; she doesn’t move, she doesn’t complain, she simply lies there. She is an ordinary piece of clothing, on any given day. There is no indifference, it is just another task accomplished. In the mistress maid relationship there is no tension, just silent complicity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tarefa I","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
