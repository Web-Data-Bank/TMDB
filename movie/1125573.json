With imagination, they introspect in solitude and rest in intimacy. At the beginning of twenty years of the 21st century, the world seemed to be in a state of chaos and disorder, with individuals slipping into depression and confusion. The middle-aged intellectual couple engage in one 'long talk' and try their best to express with words, although they might step into a greater unknown. However, expression and communication, imagination and poetry, are already the basis for something.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Talks Overnight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
