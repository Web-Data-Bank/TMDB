Provvidenza is a bounty hunter. He makes his living solely by catching his dim but powerful friend, the Hurricane Kid (Gregg Palmer) and turning him in for the reward money. A fully armed horseless carriage is one of the inventive elements of this film. One of the film's sillier highlights is an amazingly loud and long belch by the Kid. -From http://www.spaghetti-western.net","popularity":1.946,"poster_path":"/aG1pS6ss4AO0GNrviDYehcXpUrH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oceania Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":10483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Theatre Le Rex","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unidis","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1972-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":11}
