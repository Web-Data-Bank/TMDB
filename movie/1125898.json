By simultaneously presenting actions and language from different spacetime dimensions, it presents overlapping timelines. The audience has the choice to observe any screen sequentially or simultaneously, just as they have the power to navigate their own memories. Memories, like thoughts in our minds, are not linear. They emerge and disappear selectively. They also vary in size and shape. This portrayal resembles a formless and chaotic smoke, lacking a specific structure or order.","popularity":3.036,"poster_path":"/tzyKQE9PorTO1dj0dWQD60beIA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Memo, Additional Text","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
