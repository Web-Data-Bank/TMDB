Red, White and Blue stars John Boyega as Leroy Logan, a research scientist whose decision to join London’s notoriously racist Metropolitan Police, in hopes of reforming it from the inside, brings him into conflict with his family, community, and very sense of self. Based on a true story, this exploration of Margaret Thatcher–era racial tensions portrays the psychic struggle of a lone man going up against a system designed to crush him.","popularity":0.86,"poster_path":"/37b8DAloPIXAA70S2PNP8ijiRDj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Change from within.","title":"Red, White and Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
