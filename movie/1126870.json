One day, during one of his observational outings, a woman named Rose strikes up a conversation with him like he's never had before and his lonesome life seems to turn a new leaf. In this twisted romance short film, similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and 500 Days of Summer, Jorden and Rose play a game of \"cat and mouse\" to see if a blossoming romance or a doomed disaster is in store.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kpU5Xm9kAXdYwd59OGKiTjxukWY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Mr. What's It To Ya","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
