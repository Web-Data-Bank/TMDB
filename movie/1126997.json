In December 2021, Thibaut Baronian embarked on a crazy feat: running across 8 of the archipelago’s islands. The route is about 400 km long with 18,000 m of elevation gain in the heart of arid and inhospitable landscapes. A few weeks before setting off, Thibaut and his team collected donations and with the participants’ support they were able to assist several environmental non-profits and local schools. Join us on this trip to discover this outstanding project!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultra Cape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
