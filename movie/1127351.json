In search of a little microcosm in which one can hide from a reality that only smelled (or maybe still smells) of discrimination and death.  Like divers, in The Microcosm viewers swim around images and faces that build up the atmosphere of security and vitality of Chelseaâ€™s Gateways Club, in London in the Sixties, when homosexuality was still criminalised, for men as well as for women. The poetic prose of Maureen Duffy, protagonist of that past reality, makes us understand that maybe those problems and those paradoxes are not so far yet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Microcosm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
