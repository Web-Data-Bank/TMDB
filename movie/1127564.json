Weeks later, he resurfaces at a meeting of the Communist Youth where he is denounced for certain \"reprehensible actions\" and excluded from the organization. As a result of the same \"reprehensible\" deeds he is expelled from the school. His schoolmates are never told what his actions actually were. \"Notorious deeds, unworthy of being mentioned,\" is the only comment provided by a high-level communist party representative. Now, 25 years later, those involved are keen to tell their side of the story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xWlAzesLcevZvMoSQOAmn7Pr5HV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Commitet","origin_country":""},{"id":200209,"logo_path":null,"name":"Akademie der Bildenden Künste Wien","origin_country":""},{"id":200210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Production Creatives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notorious Deeds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
