This energetic 19th-century ballet is enlivened by Ludwig Minkus’ spirited score, and is a wonderful showcase for the virtuosity of The Royal Ballet's Principal dancers. Created for The Royal Ballet a decade ago, Carlos Acosta’s exuberant production brings the sunshine and charm of Spain to the Main Stage with Tim Hatley’s characterful designs.","popularity":2.556,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Royal Opera House 2023/24: Don Quixote","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
