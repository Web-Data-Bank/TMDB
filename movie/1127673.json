Forsaking her religion and community, she learns all too late that for Pinkerton, their marriage is merely an illusion – with tragic consequences.  With a score that includes Butterfly’s aria, 'Un bel dì, vedremo' (‘One fine day’) and the Humming Chorus, Giacomo Puccini’s opera is entrancing and ultimately heart-breaking. Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier’s exquisite production takes inspiration from 19th-century European images of Japan.  Asmik Grigorian and Hrachuhí Bassénz share the role of Cio-Cio-San, with Kevin John Edusei conducting.","popularity":1.294,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Royal Opera House 2023/24: Madama Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
