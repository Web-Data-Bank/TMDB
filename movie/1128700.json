Shepherds, sheep and dogs roam among the branches of uprooted trees. Above them, the city resounds with birdsong and underneath we hear the murmurs of the herd.

The land rings out and the city glimmers.","popularity":2.261,"poster_path":"/3GLkAZyz2wqBQD9n2LPxYZ7lBRQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Todos los sonidos entran adentro","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
