More than 70% of WNBA players are Black.  In an effort to elect Rev. Raphael Warnock to the U.S. Senate, players took to the court donning “Vote Warnock” pregame warm-up shirts, and the league dedicated its 2020 season to Breonna Taylor, who was killed by Louisville, Ky. police during a drug raid.  The movement quickly spread beyond the WNBA, generating massive momentum for Warnock, an endorsement from former President Barack Obama, and a runoff election win.  Six weeks later, Loeffler sold the franchise. Part of the investor group includes Renee Montgomery—a former Dream player, and the first retired player to become both an owner and a WNBA executive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":152510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Industrial Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":72131,"logo_path":"/5TD0EPhPAESDJM5QyQFlPkaVXK7.png","name":"Trilogy Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":182593,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joy Mill Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":200499,"logo_path":null,"name":"Togethxr","origin_country":""},{"id":135948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazon","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Power of the Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
