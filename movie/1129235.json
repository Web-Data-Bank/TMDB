His childhood in Poland, an eternal foreigner in Israel, his breakout role in “Hair”, his transformation into a star and his painful downfall in the 1980s. The depressing days in the wretched clubs, his divorce from his lyricist, the remarkable comeback with his song “Diva”, becoming a reality star and a “Maestro”, a stroke, his rehabilitation, and then death. These are just a few stops in the journey that Pick himself describes in his final interview, alongside those closest to him. This journey tries to decipher the personality of one of the most famous and mysterious people in Israeli culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Days of Pick ימי הפיק","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
