Bigger and richer than ever before there was money to spend - and much of that money was spent on sex. The capital was a hotbed of prostitution and promiscuity upon which tens of thousands of women and girls worked. This docudrama offers a scholarly yet sensational romp through the brothels, bordellos, bath-houses, and baronial bed chambers of the capital, with eye-opening accounts, from the time, anecdotes, rich and vivid illustrations and rousing dramatic reconstructions with a narrative featuring recurring characters. We unveil a world in which tens of thousands of women (and men) were used for sexual pleasure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45531,"logo_path":"/aQ7chdTN42fz0qtmih3yYnDWp4F.png","name":"SBS","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wuthering Harlots","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
