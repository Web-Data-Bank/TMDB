Six boys (hero, pudgy, dumb, romeo, etc), reluctantly sent to summer camp, are grouped together in a ramshackle hut, and instantly identified as losers and outcasts by the overconfident camp bullies, who target gorgeous Tiffany (Jakub) as their Lothario's girlfriend. They set out to make everyone's life miserable as they impose their authority on the other kids and ineffective counselors alike. Andy, the good-guy hero, of course has a crush on Tiffany, but hasn't a clue how to approach her. Gradually, the nice guys gain the edge over the bullies, by honest endeavor and standing up for themselves - and in doing so, win over the other kids, even Tiffany. Until the bullies frame them and have them expelled.","popularity":4.749,"poster_path":"/9jUEKhMjZSVRIRjlr8Cs6IMUXAj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1382,"logo_path":"/sOg7LGESPH5vCTOIdbMhLuypoLL.png","name":"PolyGram Filmed Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Propaganda Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Pig's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":15}
