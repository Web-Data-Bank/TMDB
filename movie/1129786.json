Rather than going to bed, he picks up the phone and dials a stranger on a hotline. As their conversation becomes increasingly sexual and revealing, André peels back the layers of his glittering persona to reveal his true self, all while the stranger on the other end delves deeper into his violent fantasies. Exploring themes of queer identity, loneliness, and sexual expression, \"Hotline\" is a raw and unflinching look at the depths of human desire and the risks we take to connect with each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1mO2RGOBuE75y6vJyCn7yLwjC8Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
