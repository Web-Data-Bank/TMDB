It portrays the prevalence of caste differentiation in food choices of people in Mumbai, how it causes exclusion, and touches upon concerns related to livelihood, social inclusion and human rights. By tracing the mythological and historical roots of meat-eating culture in India, the film explores the hierarchy maintained by Brahminical standards and their subversions. This is demonstrated through the stand taken on dealing with the political economy of the leather and meat industries. The film also follows the tumultuous scene of university caste politics through the demand for the inclusion of beef in institutions’ canteen menus. The filmmakers observe that many restaurants in Mumbai offer beef delicacies, but off the menu.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caste on the Menu Card","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
