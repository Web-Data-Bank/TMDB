Questioning the definition of the living, this project explores forms of life that emerge from what we consider inert, forgotten scraps that continue to evolve and generate new relationships with the ecosystem. Inflorescences portrays a world without humans, but whose evolution is shaped by their remains.  As part of the project, 3 sculptures are created from electronic waste, where a screen and lights come to suggest the entities present in the videos, a vision of the future of these objects left behind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k5p2XUSnwHUJXfqsqIRajTr7PUa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inflorescences I","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
