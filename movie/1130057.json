He used to be a soldier, and then became a student in the Department of Economics at Sichuan University in the spring of 1961. After he became a rightist, Mr. Li was escorted to his hometown of Long Chang County in Sichuan province. He observed that people were dying with hunger in his way to hometown. With his investigative experience in army, Mr. Li was called for conscience and justice, and started a private investigation. He braved the risk of death to write this hunger report to the central party committee leaders, requesting them to take measures to save the country. Although he received a reply from Ma Yin Chu, the former president of Peking University, and Deng Zi Hui, the former vice premier of the State Council, this did not prevent him from becoming a counter-revolutionary and getting into jail for 18 years.","popularity":0.969,"poster_path":"/a1XPSDn34hgabaEBljFzGmVSsNj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rightist Li Sheng Zhao’s Hunger Report","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
