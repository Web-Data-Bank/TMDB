His father was never in his life and his mother had her issues with substance abuse and addiction. Most kids that come from that area and that type of upbringing don't find much success in anything.  Roman was different.  RBY bounced around living with his grandparents, coaches and more. Somehow he didn't fall into any of the distractions that so many in his type of situation do. Wrestling was his ticket out and Roman put everything he had into the sport. Pushed and trained by his grandfather, RBY won four state titles, graduated high school, went on to be a star at Penn State where he became the first person in his family to graduate college.  RBY is a shining example to people from any walk of life that if you dedicate your life to your craft, put your heart and soul into everything you do, you too can overcome anything.","popularity":0.759,"poster_path":"/zgvp90USBAxSYdx53jRayyy9sTH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RBY:  Straight Outta Tucson","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
