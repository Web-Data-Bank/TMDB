Wang Dadong was arrested with a rapist sign on his chest and taken on a truck to be paraded along a street surrounded by thousands of people until his public trial. Only a few days later, the prosecutor's office acquitted Wang Dadong of rape and he was released. After his release from prison, Wang Dadong was discriminated against by the villagers and his family was split up. He was thrown out of his home and left to live in exile. For the next 21 years, Wang Dadong fought for his case, but to no avail. He was eventually classified as a provocateur and put on the \"Red Notice\" list for his petitions and appeals for his rights. In the name of the law, the public security villains who arrested him have now retired, been transferred and promoted and have left the region.","popularity":0.765,"poster_path":"/7I440aJePyW2RJctSGCQ7XN0g8u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Nobody Dadong Wang","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
