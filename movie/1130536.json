The rise in advertising has had a significant impact on our society and culture. Appearing in nearly every aspect of our lives, from television and print media to social media and online platforms, advertising has become unavoidable. The targeting and manipulation of advertising has raised concerns about privacy and data security, as well as political influence and propaganda.\r We are at war for attention. Social media platforms can shape the way we perceive ourselves and others, as well as impact our self-esteem and overall sense of self worth. This experimental film aims to spark a broader conversation about the cultural forces that shape our understanding of who we are, and the ways in which we construct our own narratives of selfhood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DIGITAL DAYDREAM","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
