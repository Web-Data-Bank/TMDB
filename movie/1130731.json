Strangely, the sightings and disturbances seemed to reach a peak with several area residents sharing the same nightmare of a river disaster. On December 15, 1967, the Silver Bridge - spanning the Ohio River between Point Pleasant and Gallipolis, Ohio - collapsed into the frigid water (sending 46 people to their deaths). Many of those who lost their lives had reported seeing the Mothman. Perhaps most disturbing, there were no reported sightings after the bridge accident.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3xPv8hkTnYwzmYn3C2gKCzm79Vh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5388,"logo_path":"/i6tbNeVEi7s1uN97s2o0LhEMuF0.png","name":"Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":200734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Route 66 Productions, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Search for the Mothman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
