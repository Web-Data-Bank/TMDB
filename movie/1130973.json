The New York Times described the music as possessing “a galvanic sense of swing” in a performance imbued with “an obliquely danceable, straightforwardly joyous Threadgillian energy.” The Other One captures and remixes the multimedia performance into a dazzling cinematic document of Threadgill’s experimental vision.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other One","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
