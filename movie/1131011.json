A collage of poetic imagery, music, and abstracted, incantatory language, the film follows two men in an excavation of our cultural soil. Their dialog gives rise to unexpected landscapes, populated by revengeful toasters, soap bubbles which fly on magic carpets, and other surprises. A postmodern video opera, Soap bathes the viewer in music and visual spectacle.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/bOqNkbauKKwQFJbBnk7jCyNxjbq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soap is an Illusion (Dirt: Part One)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
