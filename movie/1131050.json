These birds find freedom where other animals perish, yet owe their mobility in the urban space to a long history of domestication. Through their alignment with our species, pigeons inhabit a unique position in which they are both at odds with and dependent upon humans. coo-coo was shot entirely on one roll of 16mm film with all visual cuts made in-camera.","popularity":0.0,"poster_path":"/4iH2HvWndjFDNDqNZtEXjBuD8gq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coo-Coo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
