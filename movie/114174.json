The sage man refuses, and the Southerners massacre the tribe and abduct the young squaw anyway. The noble squaw manages to escape, and hides out with a rough rancher, who dislikes Indians, but hates the Southerners more. The odd couple joins forces, and tactics, to exert ultimate vengeance on the men at the fort.","popularity":2.357,"poster_path":"/4IrBuNkb5exTxypzDkeYJ91j80u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38390,"logo_path":null,"name":"Multivideo","origin_country":""},{"id":4835,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beatrice Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1987-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scalps","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":10}
