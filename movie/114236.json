At his students' urging, he recalls his surreal first love during the chaotic 1980s. As a college student, Su Young (Jung Kyung Ho) falls in love with spunky wild child Pippi (Kim Min Sun), only to see her commit suicide in front of his eyes. Strangely enough, she mysteriously reappears soon after. Adding to his confusion, Su Young finds himself increasingly drawn to and frightened by Su Ji (Cha Soo Yeon), a quirky high school girl that he is tutoring.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/c9XN8ttKmbkSS9DUN8Iq625OsoG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Eternal Hearts","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4}
