Sequences illustrating the school's approach to learning include: classroom activities in the humanities and sciences; family conferences; discussions of race, class, and gender; faculty meetings; disciplinary problems; sex education; conflict resolution by students; and student council meetings.","popularity":0.867,"poster_path":"/gWoiDmalVqR25oX1kmYkqQnMAd1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zipporah Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High School II","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":8}
