News footage shows her international appearances and visits with heads of state, including President Eisenhower allowing her to feel his face. The second half takes a day-in-the-(exceptional)-life approach to Keller's existence circa 1955. Made just 13 years before her death, Keller's famed tutor-translator-friend Anne Sullivan had already died, leaving her live-in replacement, Polly Thomson, to share the film's focus. From the time Keller takes her morning walk along the 1,000-foot handrail around her yard through her workday to her nightly reading of her Braille Bible, her serene acceptance of her life will amaze and inspire.","popularity":1.016,"poster_path":"/jcsvyvJOOhf8StoV2MicCpPgbhC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albert Margolies","origin_country":""},{"id":189379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nancy Hamilton Presentation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unconquered","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5}
