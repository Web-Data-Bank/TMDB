An army team is sent to recover it. One of the men is infected and mutates into a monster, killing most of the rest of the team. One man escapes with the help of a brother &amp; sister who live in the woods. He then tries to stop his former buddy, while also fighting against another army team sent in to destroy everything. The bio-material was supposed to create a super-soldier, was banned, and the crash of the rocket appears to have been deliberate so the experiment could proceed. But who is behind it all? And will others be infected?","popularity":2.035,"poster_path":"/wdWit3RNCo90HrwiNAGlHo0W5h6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Does It Feel To Be Next?","title":"Mutant Species","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":8}
