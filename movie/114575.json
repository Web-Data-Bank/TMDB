The resulting film from this journey is nothing short of magical.  Part road movie and part concert film, BIG EASY EXPRESS bears witness to the birth of a new musical era. With poignancy and beauty, Malloy documents these incredible musicians as they ride the rails and wow the crowds, from Oakland… to New Orleans.","popularity":2.3,"poster_path":"/ihcK4C68PaEG268vuAdm1Yb0Bd9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woodshed Films Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":72952,"logo_path":null,"name":"S2BN Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Easy Express","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":15}
