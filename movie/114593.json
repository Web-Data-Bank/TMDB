The biography defines why Carson was an enduring star (his cool, his timing, his genuine laugh, his breadth of knowledge) and pursues his motivations and inner self (a loner with a drinking problem, a decent Midwesterner whose mother withheld approval, a quiet person who loved to entertain). The key to understanding him, argues the biography, is his love of magic.","popularity":2.112,"poster_path":"/3ZFFmUtpKH9I4taIQFzaumgnIX0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnny Carson: King of Late Night","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":12}
