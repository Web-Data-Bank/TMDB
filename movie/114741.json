For the Naruse-familiar, it is an anomaly only in its placement within his filmography—indeed, this could be a film made by the elder, stasis-minded Naruse momentarily inhabiting, through a metaphysical twist of fate, his stylistically exuberant younger self. Set in depression-era Japan around the time of the Sino-Japanese War (which the director evokes, during a brief dream sequence, by dissolving between children's war games and actual adult warfare), The Whole Family Works gently observes a family coming apart at the seams. Ishimura (Musei Tokugawa) is the jobless father of nine children.","popularity":1.03,"poster_path":"/b3Z0BZHhHCbTr9QSq3T4RO3GIYW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toho Film (Eiga) Co.
