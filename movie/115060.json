The disc includes three stories to keep kids entertained as they learn about values such as cooperation and improve their problem solving skills. Mo Willems is a great children’s book author, so any issues with the release don’t stem from his work, but rather from the price for a single DVD release with only three stories when Scholastic will inevitably be releasing them as part of a larger set down the road (if they haven’t already) for a better value.","popularity":2.01,"poster_path":"/w0lXnF8HSQsGjhhUbOHcINNL8wL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
