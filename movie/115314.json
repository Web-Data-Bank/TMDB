It is a compelling history of the devastating early days of the epidemic in NYC, when men with \"GRID\" were a stigmatized population that died swiftly of a terrifying new disease. Few concepts have had as great an impact on sexuality over the past 28 years as that of \"safer sex.\" Yet, as a concept, it is important to remember two things: first, safer sex had to be invented amidst an alarming lack of information that existed before the discovery of HIV in 1984; and second, safer sex as a concept had to be sold by the persistent and creative persuasion of community based groups all across the country.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":"/qcu9AEUTKrxdgmLZp5IRjinf64L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex in an Epidemic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
