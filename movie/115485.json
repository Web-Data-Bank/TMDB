When Lucia comes into his life, he thinks she's the woman he dreams of, and sees the solution to all his problems. But Lucia, who is rather manipulating, is just what will make Pablo explode. Nobody believes in the ideal couple, not even Pablo's friends, who live all in couples, and all with problems: Between Ariel and Lola there is a professional rivalty they don't know how to cope with; Claudio lives on Natalia, and none of them feels good about it; what's wrong with Alejandro and Beatriz is just the big age difference between them two. Nobody is happy with his partenaire, but everyone will let it be, maybe for conformism, maybe for fear, maybe for lazyness, or maybe because Everything is false.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/1MGENjueQNXjp6b0ateixcpV3W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atrium Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1994-10-14","revenue":1085570,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Todo es mentira","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":11}
