The match was won by Ric Flair, who last eliminated Sid Justice to win the match and the WWE Championship. Featured matches on the undercard were The Natural Disasters vs. The Legion of Doom for the WWE World Tag Team Championship, The Beverly Brothers vs. The Bushwhackers & Roddy Piper versus The Mountie for the WWE Intercontinental Championship.","popularity":2.4,"poster_path":"/jOmv9oITYWGSsWqPeoKgs6RCRZM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every Man For Himself","title":"WWE Royal Rumble 1992","video":true,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":10}
