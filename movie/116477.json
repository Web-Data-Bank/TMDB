The local German force, supported by Stuka dive-bombers and additional troops, attacked the Italians and after several days of combat the Italians surrendered, having lost 1,300 men. As punishment, the German High Command ordered that all surviving Italians should be executed. Some 5,000 were executed during a week of killings. A handful were rescued by locals and the Greek guerrilla,  while the rest were shipped off as prisoners, whereof 3,000 drowned when their ships hit mines. The film \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\" is based on a novel about the Italian occupation of Cefalonia, but the massacre was much toned down in the Hollywood version.","popularity":1.472,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineteam","origin_country":""},{"id":7699,"logo_path":"/fHasfMWVRXGOmao2p1ijwicv9f4.png","name":"Palomar","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":84879,"logo_path":null,"name":"Endemol Italia","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2005-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of Captain Corelli's Mandolin","title":"Cefalonia","video":false,"vote_average":6.313,"vote_count":8}
