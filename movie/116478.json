Andrés works long hours, but his wife is bored, and there are tensions at home. When Isabel, a femme fatale, spots Andrés at a party, he's easy prey - but soon, she might be falling for him, perhaps enough to dump her boyfriend Paco, a small-time cocaine dealer. What if Andrés falls for her? What would he sacrifice to have her? And what about his wife; will she fight to keep him?","popularity":0.68,"poster_path":"/2n6Ls2mjnJszW0jQ5utDrM39kso.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54892,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones El Desierto","origin_country":""},{"id":9335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ España","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":29258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministerio de Cultura España","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1997-11-07","revenue":98027,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do It for Me","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
