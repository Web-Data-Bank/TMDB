In their youths, they planned to pursue careers as shepherds, but in time their individual paths diverged - leading Mitu into the military, Stelica into the local police force and Aurel into the employ of Maricel, a wealthy resident of the community. The men's worlds change forever when a newcomer arrives in the hamlet - a young woman named Lilica, accompanied by Maricel. She's toting two trucks full of Dutch chickens with her, which inadvertently spreads the bird flu to much of the local populace. The boys, however, soon realize how they can ingeniously turn this potential crisis into a solid profit-making venture for themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aAE609dgFFIlRe5ez3kCwHmklhr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1370,"logo_path":"/uch218gB4XWNz3JNhlc65A5Q207.png","name":"Castel Film","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2008-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Foreign Legion","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
