Until now, he has never given filmakers access into his life on the road. Filmed during portions of Mark Kozelek s European and North American tours of 2010 and 2011, this is a rare glimpse into Mark s backstage areas and passenger seat travels. Shot in black and white, this dynamic film captures the fast paced travel of a singer on a solo-acoustic journey, giving viewers an inspirational look at its high points, and also a stark view of its mundane realities. Footage includes an intimate version of 'Katy Song' performed at Sant'Ambrogio Church in Bologna, a mesmerizing 'Half Moon Bay' performed in Switzerland, and a flamenco-flourished Third and Seneca' filmed in a Copenhagen hotel room. . The film s soundtrack includes album tracks, concert recordings, hotel room performances, and a score written and performed by Mark Kozelek","popularity":1.027,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mark Kozelek On Tour: A Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":4}
