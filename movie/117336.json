Mere Hote! relies on the age-old tricks that made masala films so popular with viewers in 1970s and 1980s. The movie throws logic out of the window [the obsessed girl is blessed with super-natural powers], unwanted songs keep popping up every 10 minutes [at times, every 5 minutes], there's a comedy track running parallel, with no connection whatsoever with the main plot.  Simply put, Kaash... Mere Hote! is archaic, outdated!","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaash Mere Hote","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
