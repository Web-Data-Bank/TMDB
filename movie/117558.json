Filming is a way to draw out the condition of spectator and alienate it. I made this film very instinctively, naturally. Now I am beginning to learn to watch it. The very idea of something that moves, like a bird in flight… movement. The sensation of an object in space, like the light on a screen… space. The speed of the sun… time… the opposite of an image or perhaps its absence/essence. Some advice: go see a good Hollywood film: a melodramatic, sentimental story. (P. Bargellini)","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/6hUv1YxYcz7zRJRbn0EGg4LeHPZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fractions of Temporary Periods","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
