But rats (seen only as shadows), fleeing the flood, invade Hamelin in droves; a magical piper, whose music only children (and rats) can hear, strikes a bargain...which, once the rats are gone, the Mayor and council renege on, to their subsequent regret.","popularity":1.078,"poster_path":"/6IDkEN8l5vzS575RJw6KwgrAzTc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pied Piper of Hamelin","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":13}
