Based on the life and career of Fumiko Hayashi, the novelist whose work Naruse adapted to the screen several times, A Wanderer’s Notebook traces her bitter struggle for literary recognition in the first half of the twentieth century – her affairs with feckless men, the jobs she took to survive (peddler, waitress, bar maid), and her arduous, often humiliating attempts to get published in a male-dominated culture.","popularity":2.498,"poster_path":"/6f0l6k4L8oLcW8PuzfWN4ueb8SX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Eiga Company Ltd.","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1962-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Wanderer's Notebook","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":10}
