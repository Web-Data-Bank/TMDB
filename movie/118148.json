Arriving in Havana, the two women promptly lose the ashes and go through a series of misadventrues - both romantic and dangerous - to try to retrieve them. A colourful and wryly humourous tale of cross-cultural misunderstandings and lost illusions.","popularity":0.954,"poster_path":"/5dFCXVMZl2DkkDD2awKTyuonKmC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61097,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sirenic Films \u0026 Media","origin_country":""},{"id":61098,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rogue Elephant Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day of the Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":8}
