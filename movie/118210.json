Laure is the daughter of the institute's director; she's a free spirit who has captured the fancy of Nicola, a European photographer. After a courtship in which the voyeuristic Nick indulges Laure's exhibitionism and sexual freedom, they set off for Mara land with Gualtier, an anthropologist, and his philosophical lover, Myrte. As they approach the Mara on the night of rebirth, who of the group will actually join the tribe to begin life anew?","popularity":2.437,"poster_path":"/dQgXzsAh6W3Vd8pHXVdsxhZTgee.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1602,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Fox Europa","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":32165,"logo_path":null,"name":"A-Erre Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1976-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Laure","title":"Forever Emmanuelle","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":9}
