At the house, they stumbled upon an illegal weapons trade that ultimately went bad. To evade the police from interrogations, the two innocent witnesses wiped away their fingerprints and left a note that stated that the crimes were committed by \"The Black Rose,\" who is known to be a fictional hero in a 1965 movie. However, a recovered fingerprint caused Kuen to be the prime suspect, and the apprentices of the Black Rose, apparently a real hero whose legacy was portrayed in the 1965 movie, attempt to seek the truth in the matter by confronting Butterfly.","popularity":3.125,"poster_path":"/gq7xRuXBK8hdSQlhIScBh3PESta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hoventin Films Production Company Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1992-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"92 Legendary La Rose Noire","video":false,"vote_average":6.273,"vote_count":11}
