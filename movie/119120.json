This is the story of Lee de Forest, a clergyman’s flamboyant son, who invented the audion tube; Edwin Howard Armstrong, a brilliant, withdrawn inventor who pioneered FM technology; and David Sarnoff, a hard-driving Russian immigrant who created the most powerful communications company on earth.","popularity":0.803,"poster_path":"/nz6RPq4FMu3iHc2zprY7slljWA0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":5}
