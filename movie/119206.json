He constantly mocks and belittles his family with his only real ally being his girlfriend Julie. Peter's relationship with his parents reaches its boiling point when he borrows his father's new car without permission and is left by him to spend the night in jail after Peter is arrested for reckless driving. Peter runs away from home and moves into a rooming house, and eventually gets a shady job as a parking attendant. His relationship with Julie becomes exponentially more complicated and he finally realizes that being alone in the real world is much harder than he ever imagined.","popularity":1.279,"poster_path":"/4aiYElnsERI64JSy1o8rRQzuBS4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1964-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A startling film that shows what teenagers feel... but never tell!","title":"Nobody Waved Goodbye","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6}
