They arrest, interview for a minute, try in ten seconds, and execute intellectuals, aristocrats, Jews, clergy, and their families. In the building basement, five people at a time are shot as they stand naked facing wooden doors. No one to remember their last words; no martyrs, just anonymous bodies. Daily, the kangaroo court, the executions, the loading of bodies onto wagons. Srubov is cold, distant, sexually dysfunctional, and a deep thinker, hated by former friends and his family. As he tries to reason the nature of revolution and the purpose of CHEKA, he slowly goes mad.","popularity":2.301,"poster_path":"/oggz3zyJhZZmoabvKCsQx8fYZks.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sodaperaga Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":88961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Troitskij Most","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1992-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The face of death","title":"Chekist","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":17}
