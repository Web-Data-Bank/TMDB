The plot is extremely straight-forward: a pair of Vietnam vets are hired to kidnap a wanted killer from his Toronto hideout and transport him across the border into the hands of the FBI. The fugitive is a fey photographer who recruits girls from an aerobics class to star in S&amp;M snapshots and attend his vaguely satanic parties, where they are eventually tortured and murdered. With the help of an undercover female associate, the bounty hunters raid the photographer's party with smoke bombs, grab their hostage and head for the Niagara Falls border","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eyaSbAGGJOP4pUjlSCpdfkOqOzQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emmeritus Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bounty Hunters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
