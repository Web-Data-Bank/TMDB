His luck changes when he pays $250 for Buck, a sled dog that is part wolf to keep him from being shot by an arrogant Englishman also headed for the Yukon. En route to the Yukon with Shorty Houlihan -- who spent time in jail for opening someone else's letter with a map of where gold is to be found -- Jack rescues a woman whose husband was the addressee of that letter.

And when Jack and Claire Blake pet Buck one night, fingers touch.","popularity":5.921,"poster_path":"/yhlz8WV0BhlgkPVy4AAceFmlpAX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4985,"logo_path":null,"name":"20th Century Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Epic Novel . . .
