While Betty is working on her measurements, strippers continue on with the show at the Little Playhouse -- run by a Ms. Little. Nudity, striptease acts, and bawdy jokes fill the screen as Betty and her bustline provide the central focus.","popularity":1.595,"poster_path":"/n1O3xXA7fLO3wtkGwJ5hIiZNVN2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Takin' It Off","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":3}
