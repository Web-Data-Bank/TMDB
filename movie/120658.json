A bearded Richard Harris leads the modest cast with his sensitive portrayal of tormented soul Philip Rhayader, a lonely misshapen man shunned by society but with a great love of life; Harris isnt overly bitter of his treatment and expresses his compassion through his paintings and love of the waterfowl that surround him. Harris is ably supported by the waiflike Jenny Agutter as Frith, who radiates the requisite amount of youthful innocence and naivety, and won a best supporting actress Emmy Award for her performance.","popularity":1.146,"poster_path":"/A7XePSmfuGkBEaFtG8gJMG4MWO9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":9027,"logo_path":"/eGT7RxXHIyhByHpZmv4WxBwoWAl.png","name":"Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":37959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Foote, Cone and Belding Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Snow Goose","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
