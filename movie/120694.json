Alice, an actress, wants to direct an indie picture. Kaz, a talkative (and maybe bogus) deal maker, promises $3 million if she'll use Millie, an aging French star. But, Rick, a big producer, needs Millie for a small part in a fall movie or he loses his star, Tom Hanks. Is Kaz for real? Can Rick sweet-talk Alice and sabotage Kaz to keep Millie from taking that deal? Millie consults with Victor, her ex, about which picture to make, Rick needs money, an ingenue named Blue is discovered, Kaz hits on Victor's new love, and Rick's factotum connects with Blue. Knives go in various backs. Wheels spin. Which deals - and pairings - will be consummated?","popularity":1.467,"poster_path":"/lf0RzXeioR03Ha1rfL1yMQZHYO5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Revere Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":27584,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Rainbow Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-11-03","revenue":299171,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The scene behind the scenes.","title":"Festival in Cannes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
