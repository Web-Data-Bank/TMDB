They torment him verbally, ask him idiotic unanswerable questions, force him to sit down and stand up, and give him a \"party\". Then, eventually, they take him away, a tongue-tied idiot. The trivial becomes the terrible, and with it a certain wonder, a certain pity.","popularity":2.096,"poster_path":"/qgPV2nIX4i7pmoUF3ds6PBjBrhB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palomar Pictures International","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1968-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Birthday Party","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":12}
