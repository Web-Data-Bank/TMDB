But while traversing the legendary \"Snowman's Pass\" with Curt and his companions Hugo and Tyler, Diana is horrified to discover the search for her fiancé is a decoy; they are in fact hunting for a fallen spy satellite, property of an enemy foreign power. Barely escaping with her life, Diana finds herself pursued through the cold and threatening mountains in a deadly cat and mouse game, with only a backpack full of climbing gear and her instincts to defend herself against the dangerous, and increasingly desperate men.","popularity":3.011,"poster_path":"/kjbHB2x9rREFn5CGttEL6hYrGD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2865,"logo_path":"/5O0gp5QS3n9ZPRvWFxaWa6QPpGX.png","name":"Insight Film Studios","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":4679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shavick Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":1341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regent Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Quiet.
