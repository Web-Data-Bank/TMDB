Filippo Bottini Said Pippo is an \"old-fashioned\" teacher in a Roman school. He would like a Heart book-style school but clashes with the harsh reality of modern teaching and in particular with the turmoil of the seventies: strikes, occupations, armed students, feminist colleagues. Overwhelmed by events, he will find himself more and more in the maelstrom of the post-1968 protest until he becomes a drug courier. He will be arrested and incarcerated, but thanks to the release on bail provided by his colleague Lalla, with whom he had in the meantime started a relationship, he will be able to redeem himself.","popularity":0.86,"poster_path":"/wZJzXXHwLvmPDgEjeLFx2D1mW4n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1429,"logo_path":"/n1GvY0KLgk3gcEPO07L7nXncB3i.png","name":"Italian International Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1979-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tutti a squola","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":9}
