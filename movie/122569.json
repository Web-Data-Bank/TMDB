His hotly anticipated debut stand-up show was a critically lauded sell-out smash hit at the 2010 Edinburgh festival, picking up a prestigious nomination for the Fosters Comedy Award (formerly the Perrier). Following a sell-out autumn tour and a spring 2011 extension added due to popular demand, now’s your chance to see this incredible stand-up show, live on DVD. It promises to address every single issue important to the human race. But it lies - it won’t address any.
