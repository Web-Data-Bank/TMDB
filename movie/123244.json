Maybe your neighborhood. The Hutchins have a \"guestroom\" in their home. It's not exactly a business. It's a hobby. Or.....would you say religion? You see, Everett and Glory are practicing cannibals. It's a proclivity that you can't readily share with friend or neighbor. When Richard Ruebens answers Everett's classified add to buy a classic car, he becomes their latest potential meal. But......Richard has no intention of being a lamb led to slaughter.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/mQoMNikm3IwLfat1Si9JixFCHWY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dance On Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You are cordially invited for dinner.","title":"Serving Up Richard","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5}
