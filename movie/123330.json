The second film directed by the man who played the admirable lead role in Robert Bresson's A Man Escaped is a stylized and intense adaptation of a novel by Jean Giono. This police investigation in a 19th century village combines visual beauty with the rigor of the mise-en-scène—the vertigo of the criminal motivations indivisible from the refined graphics of the images.","popularity":0.741,"poster_path":"/g3IiA459BcS1CD63KBNn40h84Jr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Jean Giono","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1963-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A King Without Distraction","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":5}
