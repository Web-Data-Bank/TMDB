The location is not fictitious but instead it’s the very real Fermoy in County Cork which is a welcome touch. Like much of 1980s smalltown Ireland it’s a claustrophobic place that drives people away but inexplicably retains a strange sort of hold on them. The latter is exemplified by Gina Moxley’s character, the tempestuous Mary Hartnett who has returned after a stint in London. The other members of their gang are languid Martin (Vincent Murphy), uptight Willy, and mousey Rosie who carries a torch for Phil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Oj3oO8kjqtyfmqbmwZy7uIwW7f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clash of the Ash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
