Artist Spencer Tunick's subjects are not paid models, but ordinary citizens. The film exposes America's current attitudes towards nudity, sexuality, body image, and all the other baggage that comes up when we take off our clothes.","popularity":1.231,"poster_path":"/4eXBw1XlC3eqd3AwDWThUVHbFcg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naked States","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":9}
