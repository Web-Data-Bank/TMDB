With his trademark Fender Telecaster and distinctive finger picking style well to the fore, \"The Iceman\" delivers a set that runs from his early million selling single \"Frosty\" right up to songs from his last studio album \"Iceman\". As an added bonus there are four lenghty tracks from his 1979 appearance at Montreux to make this a definitive DVD for all blues fans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qwShyvR0pC4b0JpapAn5XwR4xMj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albert Collins: Live at Montreux 1992","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
