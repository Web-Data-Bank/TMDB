Pintilie creates a strange combination of carnival scenes which is brought to the screen as a burlesque, fast-paced, screwball comedy with a meditative undertone. This film was banned in Romania for a decade until the death of Ceausescu in 1989 and was only released after the 1989 revolution.","popularity":1.407,"poster_path":"/9IAox1tH9xs46hWoHin141Gxwsx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casa de Filme Unu","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":93666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casa de Filme Cinci","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1981-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Are the Bells Ringing, Mitica?","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8}
