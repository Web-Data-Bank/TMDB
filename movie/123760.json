A strange mix of both documentary and fiction, where in the future a group of people are looking back at the twentieth century. A virus has wiped out most of the culture of the twentieth century, leaving just fragments of a project called 'The Perimeter Fence' to be pieced together. These fragments make up a documentary about an exiled group of disparate yet similar minds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j7q4lCNPDVPSjODEkvyD3LJajB1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asylum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
