Wes, eager to sell out the local grandeur to the wealthy hordes of Southern California, wheels and deals in real-estate, but more fundamentally he hones in directly to the get-rich-quick schemes for which America is famed. Sweeping up family and friends into his monomania, Wes' zealotry leads inevitably to tragedy.","popularity":0.71,"poster_path":"/96ayArVUXt8ncFSCW8B23K8h7vq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Complex Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sure Fire","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
