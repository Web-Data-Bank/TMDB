Long influenced by the Chicago blues, the band paid a visit to Muddy Waters' club the Checkerboard Lounge to see the legendary bluesman perform. It didn't take long before Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, and Ian Stewart were joining in on stage and later Buddy Guy and Lefty Dizz also played their part. It was a unique occasion that was fortunately captured on camera. Now restored from the original footage and with sound mixed and mastered by Bob Clearmountain, this amazing blues night is being made available in an official release for the first time.","popularity":1.975,"poster_path":"/A3JnFiQ2MppmZNi2SxPjgNolYTB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214,"logo_path":"/qIptM4dZBNflgv2OXzYECv8iQNH.png","name":"Eagle Vision","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Muddy Waters & The Rolling Stones","title":"Muddy Waters and The Rolling Stones - Live at the Checkerboard Lounge","video":true,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
