Sergeant Arliss Ryder (well played with customary wired intensity by the always great Wings Hauser) has an electronic device put into his back that turns him into an out-of-control psychotic killer and put on the Strike S.Q.U.A.D. (an acronym for Scum Quelling Assault Urban Devision), which is a unit of crazed cops assigned by Captain Bill Quinton (a typically gruff Alex Cord) to rid the City of Angels of criminals by using any means necessary. The only problem is that Arliss discovers what's going down and decides to put a stop to all this madness.","popularity":1.352,"poster_path":"/fbTCWHFdYXBzk1A8FplSSiVLfsP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hit","origin_country":""},{"id":18838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metropolis Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This Cop Isn't Losing His Mind - It's Being Taken From Him!","title":"Street Asylum","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
