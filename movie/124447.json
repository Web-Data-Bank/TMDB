Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. Hughes stated that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as \"The Eagles of Death Metal\". After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like.[1] In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.\" Jesse Hughes is known by fans for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eagles of Death Metal Live at Hurricane Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
