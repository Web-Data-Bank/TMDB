L'héritage du griot","overview":"It is an ordinary afternoon for young Mabo Keïta, at home, in Burkina Faso (West Africa). While his parents are taking a nap, he reads a schoolbook on the front porch when a stranger - an elderly man carrying his own hammock - appears for an unexpected visit. It turns out that the old man is a griot, a West African musician/entertainer whose performances include tribal histories and genealogies. The position of a griot is a time-honored one and passed down from father to son for many generations.","popularity":0.77,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sahélis Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":74618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afix Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":48515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions de la Lanterne","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1996-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keita!
