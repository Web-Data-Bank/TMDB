His reason for returning is a job offer: to find and record places free from man-made sound. His quest takes him away from towns and villages into remote terrain. Throughout his journey, he is drawn into a series of encounters and conversations which gradually divert his attention towards a more intangible silence, one that is bound up with the sounds of the life he had left behind. Influenced by elements of folklore and archive, “Silence” unfolds with a quiet intensity, where poetic images reveal an absorbing meditation on themes relating to sound and silence, history, memory and exile.","popularity":0.993,"poster_path":"/qBM5WaXiPTQ37PP6hq91Xjeq8kA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2012-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silence","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":5}
