Probably best known for his oft-quoted (and misunderstood) 1960s phrase wherein Dr.Leary encouraged everyone to \"turn on, tune in and drop out\", the filmmakers sought to capture the real man behind the legend; vox-pops with friends, colleges and family pepper the storyline that made-up the multi-faceted man who was author, psychologist, teacher, guru, fugitive-from-justice and dignified humorist. We see him in his experimental 1960s, the hippie 70s, his thoughtful 80s and the futuristic 90s. Overall a very satisfying documentary about this extraordinary man. Ever the Professor, we see his musings on life &amp; death and, after succumbing to the inevitable, we witness the (somewhat macabre) after-death cryogenic storage of his severed head for his optimistic, future generations to do with what they may.","popularity":0.901,"poster_path":"/hS0tIqfD0vCaQAWHH7RxBoKhuwt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timothy Leary's Dead","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
