Yet in order to do so, the petitioners must travel to Beijing to file paperwork and wait an indefinite period to plead their case. Following the saga of a group of petitioners over the years of 1996 and 2008, Petition unfolds like a novel by Zola or Dickens. This was filmed surreptitiously from the point of view of the petitioners, and not the justice officials, the police, or those heavies sent by the municipalities.","popularity":0.922,"poster_path":"/2fG1mjOJ9E63WrGvWhvyl9rwtuW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1245,"logo_path":"/suKdkPTtHn0DzGYmrXCA506dJON.png","name":"TSR","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":22642,"logo_path":"/gqFSMOsv68FkYalHrKbUvq3pGwh.png","name":"Ina","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2009-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petition","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":11}
