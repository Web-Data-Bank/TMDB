His ocean-deep baritone voice is not dissimilar to that of the great Joe Williams, but he uses it sparingly, delivering just a few choruses before starting to dance in a manner that recalls Nelson Mandela's trademark two-step. He then eases his 67-year-old frame into a hearty slow-mo twist. This is possibly not what was expected of an artist commonly perceived as an avant-garde firestarter in the mould of Albert Ayler, and a committed disciple of the final phase of John Coltrane's career in the mid-60s.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pharoah Sanders Live at Jazz Cafe London","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
