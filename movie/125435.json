Mixing studio footage with interviews, Put It There features Paul talking candidly about the process behind some of the album's most beloved songs, especially a detailed exploration of the single ‘My Brave Face’, co-written by Elvis Costello. Candid, anecdotal and honest, the documentary is a must for any Paul fan and was expanded for its DVD release to include a gallery section and previously unseen performance footage.","popularity":1.292,"poster_path":"/rhO0XFpJaaAI3xvCAqFQYxEQTOm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4442,"logo_path":null,"name":"MPL Communications","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul McCartney: Put It There","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
