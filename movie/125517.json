She's a meter maid in Tours, working in the rain, subject to verbal abuse from those she cites. Her husband Patrick is consumed by the work of finishing their new house: carpet, tile, faucets. He's also a hothead, subjecting Sonange to tantrums. While she's often quiet and withdrawn, she longs to be a singer. When by chance she meets Mylène, an accomplished, beautiful Parisian writer she admires, Solange gives her a demo tape. Mylène is encouraging, a friendship of sorts develops, and when Solange despairs after a series of personal, emotional setbacks, she heads for Mylène's doorstep in Paris. Does a singing career await, and what about Patrick?","popularity":1.051,"poster_path":"/uGZpUA4G4RqGCjv3BNFVpRpzUot.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1115,"logo_path":"/ntH7T5gsN6wtyrfHGHJDTuneQ7o.png","name":"M6 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":313,"logo_path":"/rx5CT9wUnEz0AcdpcX9epujv7nw.png","name":"TS Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le bleu des villes","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":7}
