We were able to kill another person!' They should be,\" murmurs Minami (played by Kumiko Aso), one of the two leading female characters in Yunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni, as she lies dying in 1958, her life brought to a premature end by sickness resulting from her exposure to atomic bomb radiation.  This is a story about those who at least initially survived the first U.S. atomic bombing of 1945 and their descendants in contemporary times. The film, based on a comic by Fumiyo Kono, jumps between the two time frames and quietly depicts the sorrow and mortification experienced through the everyday lives of laid-back and soft-spoken Hiroshima people. Only a few scenes of the bombing and the ensuing devastation are featured.","popularity":0.641,"poster_path":"/9p8UApW8k7WGsCRGJBwpJGmnUtt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art Port Inc","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Shot Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":11720,"logo_path":"/3LCoBMbwUQcKqum0VDa66fJ969e.png","name":"Fukuoka Broadcasting System","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":62866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Futabasha","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":113750,"logo_path":"/A3QVZ9Ah0yI2d2GiXUFpdlbTgyr.png","name":"SEGA","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":10921,"logo_path":"/mILVV3xSs3BOkXy85l1pXakLoKk.png","name":"Sumitomo Corporation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":11726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yomiuri Shimbun Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":1780,"logo_path":"/jdnvUiU7I3Uf2ig0VZNNjf0ORRL.png","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":123663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tokyu Recreation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":13274,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tsuburaya Entertainment","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":78954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yomiuri Television","origin_country":""},{"id":569,"logo_path":"/hOurQBeeFI4OTTdAEtvGflbJgXU.png","name":"Tokyo FM","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yunagi City, Sakura Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
