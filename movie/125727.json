Wrestling, however, despite its aggression and physical combat, turns into an expression of close bonding for Nimai and Balaram, a bond already established through their complementary work at the flag station. Wrestling, for them, is a way of releasing physical energy and a form of dynamic entertainment.","popularity":1.583,"poster_path":"/4CFm6GdfZlhixpotSU1qYqVA3dJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wrestlers","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":3}
