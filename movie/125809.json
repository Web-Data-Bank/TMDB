He also presents his pet dog to a poor peasant and his wife. For the poor peasant and his wife, the dog is not a mere dog, but a symbol of the royalty which had always inspired in them feelings of respect, admiration and blind worship. They bathe the dog in a very ceremonious manner and take much care of it. They even desist from tying it up. But when the dog bites and kills a duck and then a boy, it leads to problems. The democratic leader orders the arrest of the dog, followed by the arrest of the poor peasant. Then follow protests, talks, negotiations leading to more interesting developments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dog's Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
