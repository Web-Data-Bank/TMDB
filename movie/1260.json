Every year the villagers organize an annual competition of new inventions. One of the best inventors in the village is Oskar, Lotte's father. His primary rival is Adalbert, whose wife also partakes in the competition. On the eve of the next competition, Lotte and her friend Bruno find a book soaked in the sea, from which Susumu, a gardener from distant Japan, climbs out. Susumu teaches the villagers some judo throws before a big judo competition, which the latter will eagerly use to facilitate their daily lives.","popularity":1.61,"poster_path":"/d165xgjAJam1cpNhDJAE9UMfvIA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12432,"logo_path":"/zOgIPe7TadxPBpuUsoWWSryYO6y.png","name":"Eesti Joonisfilm","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":63198,"logo_path":"/8rUh3lVPfF2mdfJU0a9BoHvvBUW.png","name":"Rija Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2006-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lotte from Gadgetville","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":11}
