Their families are struggling, their homes are physically unstable and everyone they know has dropped out of school. When a big-top circus tent suddenly appears in a nearby parking lot, they decide to take a chance. They learn trapeze, acrobatics, juggling and contortion, then audition for the end-of-year show, rehearse and prepare for the curtains to part on opening night. Along the way, WITHOUT A NET explores the connections between risk, desire, poverty and circus, and celebrates the perseverance of youth in the face of tremendous odds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without A Net","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
