He's now in trouble with the mob boss, Tom French, who sends Git to Cork with another debtor, Bunny Kelly, to find a guy named Frank Grogan, and take him to a man with a friendly face at a shack across a bog. It's a tougher assignment than it seems: Git's a novice, Bunny's prone to rash acts, Frank doesn't want to be found (and once he's found, he has no money), and maybe Tom's planning to murder Frank, which puts Git in a moral dilemma. Then, there's the long-ago disappearance of Sonny Mulligan. What's a decent and stand-up lad to do?","popularity":2.144,"poster_path":"/2rApWxlYkiwNZBSC3KJ7WFWWq1T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21872,"logo_path":"/sex8X2qwrKfFTSJLEXMPH4kmDxN.png","name":"Treasure Entertainment","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1898,"logo_path":"/8ix6SGlJiyuUDxLBtY8E0PY2G7w.png","name":"Screen Ireland","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":70198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Easkel Media","origin_country":""},{"id":1596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shooting Gallery","origin_country":""},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÃ‰","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":2188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artisan Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5892,"logo_path":"/AlfRSqTMw9RIHR2RIzy4pkcaXnY.png","name":"Buena Vista International","origin_country":"US"},{"id":915,"logo_path":"/4neXXpjSJDZPBGBnfWtqysB5htV.png","name":"Hollywood Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1997-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One doesn't count, the other can't.
