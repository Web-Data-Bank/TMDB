For behind the seemingly comfortable well-trimmed hedges of suburban Americana, live and often love, Richard and Joan Maple. Adapted from a series of stories appearing in the New Yorker Magazine over a period of twenty three years by Pulitzer Prize winning author John Updike (\"The Witches of Eastwick\", \"Rabbit Run\"), \"Too Far To Go\" garnered overwhelming critical praise in its theatrical debut. With its exceptional cast, this film envelops us in a poignant, sometimes funny, sometimes exasperating journey through this most important relationship.","popularity":2.004,"poster_path":"/kP2SNtw1h79lU77uSMuy3TDdqHi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sea Cliff Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":14312,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polytel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Too Far to Go","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
