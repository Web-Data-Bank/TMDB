So he is very excited when after nearly being knocked down by her car he meets Maria, who seems immediately enamoured of him. He is soon invited to her sumptuous Palermo villa, little suspecting that this is part of a plot. He bears an amazing likeness to Maria's stool-pigeon gangster husband and it would be convenient for them if the mobster, in the shape of Dante, was seen to be dead and buried.","popularity":7.34,"poster_path":"/5scWsRsH5MUJEgXB52w0fM6I2gM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cecchi Gori Group Tiger Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":6651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Penta Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1991-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes a banana is just a banana!","title":"Johnny Stecchino","video":false,"vote_average":7.356,"vote_count":946}
