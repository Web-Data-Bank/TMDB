It all begins when an unlikely bond forms between Sean (Connor Jessup) and a preppy teenage girl named Deanna Roy (Alexia Fast). Deanna's boyfriend is deeply threatened by Sean and Deanna's friendship, resulting in a violent confrontation. Seeking to protect himself, Sean issues a death threat online - and is swiftly arrested. When the police raid Sean's home, they find rifles, shotguns, knives and ammunition - all property of Sean's father Ricky (Michael Buie), an avid hunter. They also find a supposed \"hit list\" with twenty names of people who have tormented Sean. The authorities and the media proclaim another Columbine has been narrowly averted, and soon Sean faces a terrifying imprisonment in a youth detention facility. Sean's only hope is to overcome his dark image, and prove his innocence to Deanna and to his community.","popularity":5.816,"poster_path":"/9J8NkXUvkqs5zqYofnDMpLvV0Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17758,"logo_path":null,"name":"A71 Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":18698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Festina Lente Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":18699,"logo_path":null,"name":"Story Engine Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An alienated teenager's posturing online threat ignites a firestorm of fear in a small community.","title":"Blackbird","video":false,"vote_average":6.622,"vote_count":41}
