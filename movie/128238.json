The young revolution sweeps the streets of Maputo clean of prostitutes and bad habits. The prostitutes are sent to re-education camps deep in the countryside, where they will become “new women” – loyal comrades of the new nation. As the “clean-up” takes place, Margarida, a 16-year-old girl from the countryside, is mistakenly taken. Drawing on the stories of real women, Virgin Margarida is a dramatic exploration of a little known chapter in Mozambique’s history. A chapter that made no allowance for individuality and enshrined male domination as an ideology.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8hFEO684WSDAXOO0cPdrbuPtx3H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8680,"logo_path":"/lTvO3MFX5eogjWEpWmLUipxeKVi.png","name":"Ukbar Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":40110,"logo_path":"/c6Iv5teEgHAPXeB7mwfWIswbBxt.png","name":"Ébano Multimédia","origin_country":"MZ"},{"id":3883,"logo_path":null,"name":"JBA Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MZ","name":"Mozambique"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2012-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virgin Margarida","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
