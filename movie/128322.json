Pretty surprising film coming from Coronet about the \"honeymoon is over\" drama that newlyweds face. The marriage between Dotty and Pete is pretty traditional--Dotty quits her job to be a homemaker once they are married--but some more modernistic ideas come out, such as the idea that the two newlyweds decide together how the money that Pete earns will be spent, and the small mentions of sex. (!!) The \"educational collaborator\" listed at the beginning, Lemo Rockwood, was a professor at Cornell University, and her marriage course advocated sexual frankness and pre-marital experimentation, so it's easy to see her stamp on this film.","popularity":0.906,"poster_path":"/qTazGXmjGYzqLJV32h5G3DD0ZQZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marriage Is a Partnership","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":9}
