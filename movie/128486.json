One of the few such films was Screaming Ninja, aka Wang Yu, King of Boxing.  The story is set in China in the early 1900x.  Essentially playing an extension of himself, action-star Wang-Yu spends much of the time defending himself against evil martial-arts masters.  He also tries to make sense of a tragic incident in his past.","popularity":1.227,"poster_path":"/c1KoSU2yz7ZKM07HoJWfmneQViH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chin Hua Film Company","origin_country":""},{"id":2521,"logo_path":"/e9lXexogBN1nOXA8axzASggea8B.png","name":"Orange Sky Golden Harvest","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1973-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Scream Of The Tiger Is The Cry Of Revenge!","title":"The Screaming Tiger","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":8}
