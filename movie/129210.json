When the minister of tourism discovers this, she immediately sends her agents to check out the veracity of the potentially scandalous water. After the village mayor declares a 3-day ban on sexual activity, he then plugs up the fountain. When the agents come, they find nothing. One of the agents wants to have his boss come and check it out personally, but changes his mind after he drinks some of the water. It really is an aphrodisiac! Soon tourists are arriving by the hundreds to sample the mysterious water. Unfortunately, the minister finds out and claims the water for the state.","popularity":1.321,"poster_path":"/d2pCHtglYUF8gmsADDfuVGxl2ld.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intercontinental Produktion","origin_country":""},{"id":1009,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crown International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1966-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The biggest, barest, bawdiest, romp... since Eve started wearing pants!","title":"The Fountain of Love","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":3}
