Against the background of the idyllic nature, the individual stories of the guests develop as their relational perils and personal moments of love, desire, loss and trust show the world as it is. Without knowing, and almost imperceptibly, the visitors' lives intertwine and join into one story.","popularity":0.652,"poster_path":"/qO6wXpFRkiXU5fItkWb7VgMOgx2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3142,"logo_path":null,"name":"IdtV Film \u0026 Video Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island Guests","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
