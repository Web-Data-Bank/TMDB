Howard was doing all kinds of \"butt-bongoing\" at the time and the title skit on the video is a send-up of Hispanic dance shows, with your host \"Howard Estern.\" The video also features Jessica Hahn in the 3-D skit \"Jungle Man\", \"Guess Who's the Jew\" with Kurt Waldheim, Jr. and KKK-guy Daniel Carver, see Capt. Janks go on a date with John DeBella's wife (which Howard predicted would happen in his battle with DeBella in Philadelphia), the \"Gross Video Contest\" winners, Boy-Gary dressed as an ape and eating his baby doody, the classic \"Tribute to Vagina,\" and you get to tag along on a real, live, lesbian dial-a-date. Many consider this to be Howard's best video of all. Exact sales figures were never released, but the best guess-timates were that \"Butt Bongo Fiesta\" sold about 300,000 copies with virtually no advertising except for Howard pushing it on the show.","popularity":1.15,"poster_path":"/bxYerz4RHcfGaAKrJDsTDRLQpvG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howard Stern's Butt Bongo Fiesta","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
