From the bluesy, atonal  music and haunting lyrics, to the artist’s steadfast seclusion and sheer longevity, everything about this man intrigues. Twenty-five years, 34 albums, and not a single live show or public appearance. Even the simple detail of the man's real name is a mystery. Jandek on Corwood is the 89-minute documentary that explores this man, his world and his music.","popularity":1.716,"poster_path":"/3MBEStSoD4Mp2JWBGYsAP1WE3nP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jandek on Corwood","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
