DeMille produced this exuberant blend of orientalist melodrama and gender-bending comedy featuring his THE TEN COMMANDMENTS leading lady Leatrice Joy. An over-protective sea captain forces his daughter Eve to pass as a boy. But she craves romance and sets her sights on a handsome American tourist (Boyd) who still thinks she's a boy when she shanghais him aboard her father's ship; then a lustful Chinese pirate (Walter Long) takes them prisoner. Joy, an appealing comedienne whose career nosedived when talkies came in, sparkles in both her tomboy and love-hungry phases. -Martin Rubin, Gene Siskel Film Center","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9IJdWhcTNaKLiHkKsVjRaKgYSkz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eve's Leaves","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
