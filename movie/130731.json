Lombardi had hung himself one year earlier in his New York studio. Who was this Mark Lombardi, a man whose work was so explosive that even terrorist hunters were using it as research? The film portrays an incredibly brilliant artist who took on the social function of a watchdog by using public information and arranging it to expose the grand illegal practices in the globalized world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dAvU16RnsuzkasjNnXbIzaF0Nph.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45198,"logo_path":"/9z46Z8Px88a30wkr7G0QUDbbtt2.png","name":"Deutscher Filmförderfonds","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":22627,"logo_path":"/mZsZ3IYzoheUPTPN3WeFwOYxAkP.png","name":"Film- und Medienstiftung NRW","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2026,"logo_path":"/q9s9KGhSsFEnpTmLLwprytB3T3d.png","name":"FFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mark Lombardi - Death Defying Acts of Art and Conspiracy","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
