After three months in custody, Koch, together with 12 other animal-rights activists, went on trial. They were charged with being members of a criminal organisation and therefore breaching article 273a of the Austrian Penal Code, introduced in the wake of 9/11. The article’s intention is to allow the state to stifle terrorist activity. Years of observation, house searches, and undercover agents – the police left no stone unturned in its bid to prove the animal-rights activists’ guilt. The sobering result: five million Euros worth of investigation, no proof and a great deal of scepticism towards the Austrian justice system – and democracy itself. Filmmaker Igor Hauzenberger captures one of the highest profile cases this alpine republic has ever seen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eRmrTbyOLbaFm2DrdI76OOYEYNT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136173,"logo_path":null,"name":"FrameLab Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trial","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6}
