She is now an old lady, and Andalusia has long since become Europe’s vegetable plantation, with 90% of the sweet peppers in our supermarkets coming from the so-called plastic coast. It’s a lucrative business – but not for the farmers of San Agustín, whose share of profits is miniscule. This results in many of them taking on cheap labour from illegal African immigrants. A mysterious virus that threatens to destroy the crop further compounds the situation – with the affair dubbed the “cucumber crisis”. In this portrayal of a village and its people, three filmmakers highlight in nine chapters the deeper workings of industrialised agriculture – presenting another side to Southern Spain, far from its image as a beach filled, party Mecca. Like the holiday industry, vegetable growing receives criticism for its excessive exaggeration. But who are the real black sheep?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Agustín - Marea baja en el mar del plástico","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
