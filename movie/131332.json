Under the rule of an oppressive monarchy backed by military force, the miners often resort to stealing gold to compensate for their meager wages. Workers are subjected to strip searches and are forced to take laxatives by the often brutal guards and inspectors as they look for stolen gold, and Jacob raises his vocal objections over the treatment of his fellow workers.","popularity":0.625,"poster_path":"/ziJReFXu6yOMuXj8eSwiYSMBG6w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7168,"logo_path":null,"name":"România Film","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":128246,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artexim","origin_country":""},{"id":92155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul cinematografic „Bucureşti\"","origin_country":""},{"id":93666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casa de Filme Cinci","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1988-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jacob","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
