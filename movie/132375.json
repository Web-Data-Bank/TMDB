It too has a stream-of-consciousness narration: Jocasta, as she is about to kill herself, remembering what has happened to her. It too contains soul-delving solos, broken up by ensemble dances. Here, however, the ensemble is a darker element. As the story was taken from Greek tragedy, so the corps is the equivalent of Greek tragedyâ€™s chorus. They tell us how to feel: afraid mostly. In this piece Graham pushed her habitual economy to its limits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/piFFaUvGMfGZ6UadsiZpNGQmYGA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Journey","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":7}
