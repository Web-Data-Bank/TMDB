Their earnings sustain one out of every three households and remittances prop up the country, but these come at a high cost.  The film provides a rare glimpse of the migrant experience in Qatar, where they outnumber natives by 3 to 1. Their struggle to endure long working hours in stultifying heat, burdened by loans and high expectations of home, and the upheaval and fractures of emotional life is overwhelming, unhinging the compass of their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Desert Eats Us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
