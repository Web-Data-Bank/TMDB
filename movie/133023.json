Sebastian's mother, Violet Venable, trying to cloud the truth about her son's homosexuality and death, threatens to lobotomize Catharine for her incoherent utterances relating to Sebastian's demise. Under the influence of a truth serum, Catharine tells the gruesome story of Sebastian's death by cannibalism at the hands of locals whose sexual favors he sought, using Catharine as a device to attract the young men (as he had earlier used his mother).","popularity":1.244,"poster_path":"/2bAPQuVdclq2TOwWuo5d4aPJu1H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39477,"logo_path":"/hfXGuDnuVFOYJVfw83fJvGUtt5O.png","name":"KQED","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Television Adaptation of the Tennessee Williams classic.","title":"Suddenly, Last Summer","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
