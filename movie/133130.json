These are some of the second-grade pupils attending an Elementary School, in the heart of Tel Aviv. The film follows the class throughout one school-year, which becomes volatile as the Gaza War upsets the social dynamics in the classroom. With poignant intuition and uninhibited directness, unique to eight-year olds, the children point out basic conflicts in Israeli society, deal with painful identity issues, and experience the first cracks in their childhood naivety.
