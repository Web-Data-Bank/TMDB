He is presented with a job, an apartment - even a wife. But before long, Andreas notices that something is wrong. Andreas makes an attempt to escape the city, but he discovers there's no way out. Andreas meets Hugo, who has found a crack in a wall in his cellar. Beautiful music streams out from the crack. Maybe it leads to \"the other side\"? A new plan for escape is hatched.","popularity":7.517,"poster_path":"/mHDeIKvmWYLyXwqXzN4F7Q2CHRT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandrew Metronome Norge","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2006-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bothersome Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.98,"vote_count":198}
