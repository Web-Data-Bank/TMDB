It looks at the proliferation of one typeface (which will celebrate its 50th birthday in 2007) as part of a larger conversation about the way type affects our lives. The film is an exploration of urban spaces in major cities and the type that inhabits them, and a fluid discussion with renowned designers about their work, the creative process, and the choices and aesthetics behind their use of type.","popularity":7.712,"poster_path":"/s47TOnvnwfSnAflQvsBxJbOLnmP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Swiss Dots","origin_country":""},{"id":8744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veer","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Helvetica","video":false,"vote_average":7.224,"vote_count":147}
