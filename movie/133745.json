He has received many Grammy nominations, both for his work with the Dregs and as a solo artist. He has worked with dozens of famous guitarists of various musical genres, and been a member of the Dregs, Kansas, Living Loud, and (of course) Deep Purple.  These performances come from 1990, a few years before he joined Deep Purple, when he was touring with the Steve Morse Band, a trio that included bassist extraordinaire Dave LaRue, and drummer Van Romaine. The DVD features two concerts culled from the vaults of the German television program Ohne Filter Show.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Germany March 1990","title":"Steve Morse Band: Live in Baden-Baden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
