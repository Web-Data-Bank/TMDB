Suzuki's hair-trigger temper is held somewhat in check by the motherly instincts of his wife, Tomoe, and his young son Ippei immediately bonds with Mutsuko as if she were his older sister. The Suzuki shop lies almost in the shadow of the Tokyo Tower as it rises steadily above the skyline during construction in 1958.","popularity":2.28,"poster_path":"/20lchzT4J5v8VwEIud6CicAwBoZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2752,"logo_path":"/qEGEoCAV9FWAuohymR5I0vjJMgM.png","name":"dentsu Music And Entertainment","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2005-11-11","revenue":33053559,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Always - Sunset on Third Street","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":30}
