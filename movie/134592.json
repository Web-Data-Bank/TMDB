But, contrary to the producers’ expectation, the Left lost. Ruiz seized on this anti-climax to make a documentary about nothing except itself – a film whose central subject is forever lost in digression and ‘dispersal’, harking back to his Chilean experiments of the ‘60s. Its political content is deliberately left negligible: it’s hard to tell at the end who did actually win the election, let alone why.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hPMoRgO0RunPejLX9slQlnYZuJh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22642,"logo_path":"/gqFSMOsv68FkYalHrKbUvq3pGwh.png","name":"Ina","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Great Events and Ordinary People","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
