Broderick Crawford plays a despotic 10th century Spanish king who, in cahoots with the invading Moors, has banished handsome Castilian nobleman Spartaco Santoni. With the surreptitious aid of Crawford's daughter Teresa Velasquez, Santoni assembles an army to march against the Moors. In keeping with the 13th century epic poem from which this film was derived (\"El Poema de Fernan Gonzales\") Santoni's path is smoothed by the celestial intervention of patron saints Milan and Santiago. Among the big names picking up a few tax-free dollars in The Castilian are Cesar Romero, Linda Darnell, Alida Valli and Fernando Rey.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/aIOHeoWMRfYnR3PpJ7tFmLxBUsV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemagic Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":40780,"logo_path":null,"name":"M.D. Producciones Cinematográficas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"TRUE...Actually Shot in the Medieval Locations Where the Actual Story Took Place!","title":"The Castilian","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
