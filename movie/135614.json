An ambitious diplomat, capitalizing on Bolt's celebrity, arranges for the U.S. to commission a statue for a London square to honor Bolt's achievement. Bolt's Italian wife, a renowned artist, sculpts an 18-foot nude of Bolt. In a pique, because he's neglected her for years to do his work, she gives the statue a spectacular phallus, telling Bolt that he wasn't its model. Thinking he's a cuckold, Bolt goes on a jealous search for a man matching the statue. The diplomat, too, wants changes in the statue to protect his conservative image. Can art and love reconcile?","popularity":1.952,"poster_path":"/qIoORjHqDsrHuNapAYKuKwTztZ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Josef Shaftel Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The face was his... the body was his... but suddenly â€” hello \"Charlie\"","title":"The Statue","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":8}
