No Logo is the warning on the label.  In the last decade, No Logo has become a cultural manifesto for the critics of unfettered capitalism worldwide. As the world faces a second economic depression, No Logo's analysis of our corporate and branded world is as timely and powerful as ever.  Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic expos√©, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective. It tells a story of rebellion and self-determination in the face of our new branded world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A31EtMx1Jk1p4Si3d3EnCVHuqyM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Brands, Globalization & Resistance","title":"No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8}
