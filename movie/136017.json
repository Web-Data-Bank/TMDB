One thing it is never is immaterial.  The film manages to break down the Middle East conflict into individuals and to show what enormous influence it has, even into the most intimate of spheres.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2011-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Would You Have Sex With an Arab?","video":false,"vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":6}
