Alejandro is wealthy and alone, passing time with music, chess, and his shotgun. Gregoria (Goyita) the daughter of a weak-willed policeman and his bullying wife, is a budding naturalist who conspires to meet Alejandro. Even though he knows the village is talking, Alejandro spends time with Goyita, on walks, horseback rides, and dinners. He's enchanted and tells his friend the village priest that he's living for the first time. Goyita makes new demands on Alejandro, and he must decide how to be true to his ethics and to this Platonic yet highly-charged relationship.","popularity":2.083,"poster_path":"/pxDKHf80wmnzmiNKEHh4HrGAPja.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77052,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinespania S.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":77053,"logo_path":null,"name":"A-Punto ELSA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1980-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nest","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":17}
