Rocking Out The Bats","overview":"A beautiful warm late summer night it was when five musicians started one of their maybe most remarkable outdoor concerts in the City of Berlin. The so-called \"Zitadelle\" in the Spandau district of Berlin is more than historic in many ways. Apart from the political heritage and burdens it is also the home of thousands of bats - one of the largest community of these creatures in Europe. Within the very old walls and niches of the building they live a very WWF protected life. Therefore the band had to except a curfew by 10 pm which was rather sad because they had a lot more to say musically. But nevertheless it has been a breathtaking event for those who could attend. On this DVD you will see the whole show and some extras behind the scenes, sometimes with a laugh and sometimes with an ironic attitude. So enjoy a warm summer night's show on a cold midwinter night.:-)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tangerine Dream .
