The most likely suspect in Fran's disappearance is her husband John, but without a body, neither Deanna or Sherrie can prove that murder, much less a crime, has even been committed. With the support of Sherrie, Deanna embarks on an eleven-year search to trace John's past, eventually uncovering a 25 year-old case of a missing person that involved John's first wife, who too, disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Using this lead, Deanna and Sherrie must use all their evidence to bring John to justice.","popularity":1.303,"poster_path":"/qK42uilajFm6FaUIY5Ld9qMYlSU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3958,"logo_path":"/xkdYNmOW6e4gjgp4NSLRt0W5UIj.png","name":"Front Street Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":6426,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dan Wigutow Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder on Pleasant Drive","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
