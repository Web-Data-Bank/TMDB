Sure, many films and TV shows have portrayed what it was like for the UN forces. This film takes you into the melee from the perspective of Egyptians -- who were sharply divided about the war -- and their daily lives, which, as one sees, form the basis of their foundation for understanding/approaching the war. And it really is these \"every day\" realities that make up the bulk of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b6ZXekV0AS7NVQSJRTeiF9g1VF8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"2001-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Storm","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
