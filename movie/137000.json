The film is an ode to the texture, the beauty, the singularity of aging faces and silhouettes, a hypnotic poem in the Dwoskin meaning of the term which is long observations of very tiny details. A gesture, a pause, a look, a moment. Throughout his films intimacy has always played a leading role and this is also true for Age is..., all the faces being close friends, or close friends relatives and sometimes even Stephen himself.","popularity":1.942,"poster_path":"/k9Al0st22dF0DHSD2SKztIseKtt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Age Is...","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5}
