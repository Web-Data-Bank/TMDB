It tells the story of the Stones' unparalleled journey from blues obsessed teens in the early 60s to their undisputed status as rock royalty. All of the Stones have been newly interviewed and their words form the narrative arc that links together archive footage of performances, news coverage, and interviews, much of it previously unseen. Taking its title from a lyric in \"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\" this film gives the viewer an intimate insight into exactly what it's like to be part of the Rolling Stones as they overcome denunciation, drugs, dissensions, and death to become the definitive survivors. Over a year in the making and produced with the full cooperation and involvement of the Stones, this film is and will remain the definitive story of the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band","popularity":5.365,"poster_path":"/7rGmjuPjtddvMcfrvaRuxIzCUew.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Milkwood","origin_country":""},{"id":58637,"logo_path":"/yLSNxhJzLwYS0OZmLGjwnPcUGUT.png","name":"Tremolo Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...The Rise Of The Stones...","title":"Crossfire Hurricane","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":49}
