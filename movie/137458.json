A climatic confrontation proves to each of them just how mean the other can be. \"The Meanest Men in the West\" is actually an amalgam of two episodes of the hit 1960's TV series, \"The Virginian.\" In one installment, a wealthy man's daughter is kidnapped by a nasty gunslinger. But the crime is only just a means for the ruffian to draw the tough title character into a blood- thirsty revenge scheme. In the second, a drifter burglarizes the Shiloh ranch. Then an unhinged girl relies on the man to aid in her flight from home.","popularity":2.835,"poster_path":"/9GFZ7MURHLGcSBwHtMESUg3HBpR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26727,"logo_path":"/jeTxdjXhzgKZyLr3l9MllkTn3fy.png","name":"Universal Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Revue Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Meanest Men in the West","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":10}
