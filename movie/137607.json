While hiding out in the hayloft of the Count de la Braquette's estate, she meets the hayseed handyman Sébastien and the butler Malou, who reward her favors with the offer of employment. In a manner recalling Terence Stamp's effect on the household in TEOREMA, Celestine's open and relaxed attitude toward sexuality has a transformative effect on the isolated, moribund inhabitants of the mansion, imbuing them with gift of renewed life for the men and women alike, that remains even after a third act twist that forces her to betray them.","popularity":4.783,"poster_path":"/99MbbIjc3wTSeNKjvE1lqKIj3lv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5779,"logo_path":"/tGITNHYaqbnnqM8u5QK6Aw9lnWg.png","name":"Comptoir Français du Film Production (CFFP)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":38374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinépix Film Properties (CFP)","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1974-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She'll tickle your fancy !","title":"Celestine","video":false,"vote_average":5.833,"vote_count":15}
