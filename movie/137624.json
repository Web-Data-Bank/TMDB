The film records the removal of furniture and objects from the building, leaving visitors able to move freely amongst its empty spaces and a silence charged with feeling and resonance and the take from the experience whatever they demand from it - thus making poet Federico García Lorca's emotive and historic absence even more powerful, evident and heartfelt.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9bfQJIDiKYLXMcvPzjBBXZB0MI9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37802,"logo_path":"/qcYcBGZFIzRR3rvXkYSU4xDlftZ.png","name":"Films 59","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2008-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mudanza","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
