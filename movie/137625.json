Eschewing dialogue, the director constructs a non-narrative story in fragments that reveal the daily lives of an adulterous couple interspersed with a cryptic stream of unrelated imagery. The title of this homage to directors including Eisenstein, Antonioni, Bergman, and Buñuel refers to the 29 “black years” of the Franco dictatorship. — chicago.cervantes.es","popularity":1.302,"poster_path":"/9VymaYQWmA0ttlhX9UJMcbdDIoj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37802,"logo_path":"/qcYcBGZFIzRR3rvXkYSU4xDlftZ.png","name":"Films 59","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1969-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nocturne 29","video":false,"vote_average":5.133,"vote_count":15}
