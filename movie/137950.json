This DVD was filmed at Irvine Meadows, California on 12 June 1982. The show was part of the delayed continuation of the \"Diary of a Madman\" tour following the tragic death of Randy Rhoads in March 1982 in a flying accident earlier on the tour. The show features guitarist Brad Gillis who was brought in to replace Randy Rhoads. The concert is a perfect snapshot of Ozzy's live performances in the 80s with dramatic staging and masses of energy with a set list based around his first 2 solo albums and a few Black Sabbath classics. Ozzy has always been one of heavy metal's great frontmen and, despite the difficult circumstances, this show captures him at his absolute best.","popularity":0.658,"poster_path":"/2rvPFCsGz9sD6t9WJGAjjyoLWCu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Recorded at Live The Ritz, New York, USA - 26 & 27 September 1982.","title":"Ozzy Osbourne: Speak of the Devil","video":true,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
