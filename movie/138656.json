As a result of the difficulties the team encounters, disorganization gradually takes over the convoy. Each of the members of the group, little by little, yield to their petty, selfish impulses: violence, power, nostalgia - The breakdown of one of the trucks forces Michele and Nadia to wait at an oasis for the arrival of spare parts. But a starving local tribe settles threateningly near them. The chief of the tribe makes a speech they don't understand, which is followed by a macabre purification ceremony.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/y0q0LytWHdizLBsRZL6bARzQR7E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42042,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.M.S.
