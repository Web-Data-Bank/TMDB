No human words are spoken here. Rather, the sights and sounds of Christmas are presented in a visual feast of whimsical, happy scenes accompanied by seasonal music. From sledding and snowmen to glowing candles and shimmering ornaments, dozens of animated and live-action settings communicate the beauty and wonder of the holiday season. Penguin puppets unwrap presents, ring bells, and toss tinsel. Santa's sleigh in a gentle snowfall segues smoothly into a playful group of Christmas-clad youngsters dancing to Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker.\"","popularity":1.121,"poster_path":"/iEf8DCvCdxFJtw1yysTttco43Kt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72308,"logo_path":"/uWSAY8ShgVsIdKtWUyav8QfI2nG.png","name":"The Baby Einstein Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby Einstein: Baby Santa's Music Box","video":true,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
