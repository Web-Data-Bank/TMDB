Filmmaker Gloria Z. Greenfield travels from Israel to Europe to North America, covering this phenomenon from all angles, including historic Christian and contemporary Islamic polemics against Jews, the proliferation of anti-Israel bias in academia and cultural institutions, misinformation campaigns and state-sanctioned calls for the destruction of the Jewish state and the killing of Jews. Wide-ranging interviews include such eloquent and respected voices as legal experts Alan Dershowitz, Senator Joe Lieberman, Ambassador John Bolton, human rights activist Natan Sharansky, British attorney Anthony Julius, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, Wall Street Journal's Bret Stephens, among many others. UNMASKED JUDEOPHOBIA is a call to action and urgent reminder that Antisemitism is a menace not only to Jews, but to the human condition itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unmasked Judeophobia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
