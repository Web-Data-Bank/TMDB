Not to mention that the simplicity of the characters often make the movie very predictable. That said, romantic comedies often don't work overall and viewers are left with a few good moments here or there. All that is said to explain what you won't find in \"Fool For Love.\" That is because the two main characters, in particular Dustin Nguyen's character \"Dung\" have a complexity to them that creates a real life foundation from which the romance and comedy can be built.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2gsVKln2cGAb91OtgwgOCCDxCSc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2010-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fool for Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":4}
