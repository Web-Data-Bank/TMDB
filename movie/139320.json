His St. Nicholas wish list includes a pedal car, just like the one the sneaky mayor’s son Roderick has. These are the depression years in the 1930s and because the haul falls short, his father stays in Spain a little longer to earn some extra money. Bennie now only has one wish left: that his father will come home. If need be, he will go and get him from Spain himself. He catches Roderick erasing his name from the Bad Children list in St. Nicholas’ Great Book when an idea occurs to him. He quickly adds his name to the list, which lands him a place in St. Nicholas’ bag. But the saint does not understand that Bennie doesn’t mind going to Spain.","popularity":1.194,"poster_path":"/cHjMUQmIV2SCyz6f2PyTgvTTXyL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60652,"logo_path":"/pNlPbnwBkKgZsc2yXrDmkakCOyb.png","name":"Johan Nijenhuis \u0026 Co","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":85770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Farmhouse Film \u0026 TV B.V.","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":22071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mollywood","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2011-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bennie Brat","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":11}
