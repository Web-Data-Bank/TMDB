Hilarious and revealing, this is a film about women who choose between affection and money, film producers that don't really know what they're filming, and weary businessmen who sometimes say screw it, down a shot and leave their mother-in-laws to pay the bill. But most of all, it's about true love that favors noisy kitchen floor over gilded fine-dining halls.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/rX2NwDZImNUE4bk3RqpZLhKK3MA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103844,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Creative Union","origin_country":""},{"id":69021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Look-Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2012-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Till Night Do Us Part","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7}
