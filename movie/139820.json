A contemporary of Rembrandt and, indeed, more celebrated during his life, Goltzius seduces the Margrave of Alsace into paying for a printing press to make and publish illustrated books. In return, he promises him an extraordinary book of pictures of illustrating the Old Testament’s biblical stories. Erotic tales of Lot and his daughters, David and Bathsheba, Samson and Deliah and John the Baptist and Salome. To tempt the Margrave further, Goltzius and his printing company will offer to perform dramatisations of these erotic stories for his court.","popularity":7.767,"poster_path":"/z4KpZ7lQZFzKjALh8OpfgH2Jnmx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21446,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film and Music Entertainment (F\u0026ME)","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5056,"logo_path":"/kADFcjL04xe5HGBnlLjbfhliS2a.png","name":"Head Gear Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":25954,"logo_path":"/oga9DS7GZGbZ0iZ4JFuVTBMBv1C.png","name":"Metrol Technology","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2012-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goltzius & the Pelican Company","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":28}
