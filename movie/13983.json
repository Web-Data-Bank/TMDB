With the public hungry for more Lee, movie execs decide to find a replacement. This outrageous satire looks at the entire process, from the oddball candidates to the greed and racial motivations that drive the final decision. There's big business in the movies, and Finishing the Game skewers it with an eye for '70s detail.","popularity":3.018,"poster_path":"/seJXf2KFHJ4YdBMCt9L3CStj5Dd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cherry Sky Films","origin_country":""},{"id":129240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trailing Johnson Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":307,"logo_path":"/gUi3pAUznQJpR296lw4mSVbB7zx.png","name":"IFC Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":308,"logo_path":"/e8F3mQM7DkJ5SfYYDp8FYzPBOGX.png","name":"The Weinstein Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-21","revenue":52868,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finishing the Game: The Search for a New Bruce Lee","video":false,"vote_average":5.263,"vote_count":19}
