It is known as the Magic Train. With two state-of-the-art operating theatres, recovery rooms, offices and accommodation, each project requires a team of volunteer doctors, surgeons and nurses to give their services for free. For four weeks, cameras follow the Mandsor project as operations are carried out on poor rural people while the train is standing in a station in the middle of India.  Dashrath is going deaf, Bharat can't walk, and baby Shiva was born with a cleft lip. They cannot reach a hospital and they can't afford the operations. The operations change the lives of both patients and doctors. With compelling, dynamic and moving stories, the Magic Train opens a gateway to another India, where 21st-century medicine meets village India.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"India's Hospital Train","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
