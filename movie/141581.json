The two women had moved to NYC two years previously to try their luck. Samia shares a fabulous loft with a renowned American actress and works as her assistant. Gabrielle has a more mundane job in a small retirement home. Transposed to New York, the close bonds formed over the years between the five friends from a housing project on the outskirts of Paris take on a different aspect. The laughter and emotion is dictated by the adventures they share during their stay, from the daily lives of the women to the discovery of this cult city.","popularity":6.121,"poster_path":"/83W0Q8P6vzcJ6oKnVVKVfuxn5f3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10393,"logo_path":"/7MazD0kppT5OzdumzDi5IFYNthO.png","name":"Vertigo Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1115,"logo_path":"/ntH7T5gsN6wtyrfHGHJDTuneQ7o.png","name":"M6 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11261,"logo_path":"/g7p4vSwqsIo6zYptyN3hoDxFp7y.png","name":"M6","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8372,"logo_path":null,"name":"SPAD Films","origin_country":""},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7981,"logo_path":"/6Yv1gIAuGkHS5Vis4UjnqHhCPWV.png","name":"Pathé","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nous York","video":false,"vote_average":4.764,"vote_count":233}
