Cities are deserted, technology has been destroyed and the few remaining human beings eschew anything electrical in order to avoid a confrontation with the soulless ghosts that now wander the planet. Most of the ghosts are doomed to a repetitive loop of something they did while they were still despairing humans (a man repeatedly hangs himself, for example), but there are some ghosts so locked in denial, they do not know they are dead. They continue to haunt their homes, wrapped in fear that their souls will soon be torn from them.","popularity":7.536,"poster_path":"/z0SGvrvvTlGosfA16yPmp4HpfWg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dimension Extreme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pulse 2: Afterlife","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":63}
