A 1971 visit to a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) training camp while on the way back from Cannes resulted in Adachi's most infamous film, the agit-prop documentary Red Army/PFLP: Declaration of World War, which he co-directed with Wakamatsu. Soon after, Adachi joined a splinter cell of the Japanese Red Army in Lebanon, where he stayed from 1974 until he was deported to Japan in 1997 to serve time for passport violations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r3IkQdtabohLoTsC3tK8j5XlD0d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epileptic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It May Be That Beauty Has Strengthened Our Resolve - Masao Adachi","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
