Gabino eventually tracks his father down and spends time with him in his rundown apartment, trying to figure out if there is any possibility for the two of them to ever truly communicate. Though Greatest Hits continues Pereda's exploration of his perennial themes of absence, masculinity and the difficulty of maintaining a family, it opens up a whole new set of aesthetic questions through a bold formal gambit: halfway through, the entire narrative reboots and starts from scratch with another actor playing one of the key characters, leading to different iterations of events already witnessed.","popularity":1.184,"poster_path":"/syW6D3G5HtnMjzycFn5SjQFqai4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11214,"logo_path":"/a1wXMMOXQLa0KxBvDPp6CQo50EW.png","name":"Interior13 Cine","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2012-08-02","revenue":2333,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greatest Hits","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6}
