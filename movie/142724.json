Having grown up with Hong Kong's popular culture, Tsai Ming-Liang decided to pay homage by making a \"Walker\" film, contrasting the Walker's slowness with the frenzied pace of Hong Kong's cosmopolitan life. The film ends with a song by Hong Kong actor and singer Samuel Hui, who was Tsai Ming-Liang's idol during his youth. The film was invited to be the closing short film for the Cannes Film Festival in 2012.","popularity":0.956,"poster_path":"/mAnyPmrHM9I9FSL9fX1lFtUEQKh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hong Kong International Film Festival Society","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":97898,"logo_path":"/nELT9J1TWzh3qvVXP3vCz1Q0rMd.png","name":"YOUKU","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":8041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Homegreen Films","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2012-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walker","video":false,"vote_average":6.25,"vote_count":18}
