It shows the culture, fun and comradery of the surfing lifestyle starting with the Duke in the 1940's and continues through the decades on Maui with the Uchimura Bros. and many more.  You'll also see some great surfing on Oahu's North Shore in the 70's and 80's, clean California, Australia, and current footage of surf on Maui's west side.  This film was shot entirely on 8mm and Super 8mm film. It is 37 minutes of pure fun; a movie that anyone, surfer or not, will want to see over and over again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Short Surf Film in Super Eight","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
