Their shots captured on celluloid became the images for such films as Stylemasters, The Forgotten Island of Santosha, Big Wednesday, Pacific Vibrations, Uluwatu and many more. This documentary is a cinematic journey inspired by many of the reels that were lost in the making of these films. Since that time, these reels have resurfaced and are now brought to light. A fusion of rare super 8mm film, photo stills and contemporary interviews blend together to make Chasing the Lotus the most in-depth look at the evolution of the surf culture and surf discovery ever made.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pWw9H8K8lOeeNuB5qO0HQXu362w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The lost reels of Weaver and Wills","title":"Chasing the Lotus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
