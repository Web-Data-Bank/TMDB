It's only a matter of time before the army of creatures attacks the rest of civilization and wreaks havoc upon the world. At dusk, a beat-up truck containing a rag-tag team of hardened mercenaries rolls into town, and this is not the first time they've been called in to exterminate; they are part of a secret society that has been operating outside of the government and the public eye for thousands of years. Their mission is to keep our world safe from evil-of our own creation and from beyond.","popularity":1.308,"poster_path":"/tpBSKKFr5nJrRMl3vX7XczR1sYD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guardians","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":5}
