The three stories here include \"Daniel and the Lion's Den\" from the first VeggieTales video, Where Is God When I'm Scared?, and complete programs of Dave and the Giant Pickle and Esther, the Girl Who Became Queen. All three tales illustrate the VeggieTales' creed at its best: entertaining stories from the Bible with a good deal of wackiness that make the lessons go down easy--for both kids and grownups. \"Daniel\" showcases the remarkable variety of original music the series produces, while Dave may be the quintessential VeggieTales episode. Each segment begins with energetic youngsters discussing the themes. --Doug Thomas","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heroes of the Bible - Lions, Shepherds and Queens (Oh My!)","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
