The four are great friends of Carlos Alberto, a stock car driver who suffers from the frames of rival Hugo and his gang. By doing scientific research in his mini-lab, Jegue discovers two powerful formulas: one extracted through the Quince tree, an abundant fictitious plant in the Northeast; and another that turns Dr. Jegue into a big, bearded, moody man with powerful strength. The Marmeleiro formula is tested in a race at the Interlagos Autodrome in the old track and the news of a \"new fuel\" becomes the main news of the country. Soon, buyers from all over the world come to Brazil to try to buy the formula, offering a lot of money for it, but Jegue, not ambitious, decides not to sell the formula anymore and leaves it in his country.","popularity":0.812,"poster_path":"/xAP2ZzCdiOdrynIwPR702gMK668.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Renato Aragão Produções Cinematográficas","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Incrível Monstro Trapalhão","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":12}
