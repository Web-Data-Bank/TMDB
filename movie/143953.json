But he is destined to learn greater truths: shocked to discover the pain and suffering of so many in his kingdom, he abandons his privileged existence, and his wife Gopa (Seeta Devi), to become a wandering teacher, eventually finding enlightenment and founding Buddhism. Featuring superimposed images and deep-focus shots that were highly impressive for the time, Light of Asia astutely combines a deeply felt spirituality with the surefire attraction of Indian exotica, which helped make it a considerable success in Europe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8mk6yB2cpyWFFP8ClT1m02nLpbT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70360,"logo_path":null,"name":"MÃ¼nchner Lichtspielkunst AG (Emelka)","origin_country":""},{"id":70361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Great Eastern Film Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":70362,"logo_path":null,"name":"Himansu Rai Film","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1925-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Light of Asia","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7}
