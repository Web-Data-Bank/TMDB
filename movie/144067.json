Roaming the fertile fields of Australia, Dusty is captured as a puppy. Though dingoes are normally averse to human companionship, Dusty attaches himself to an old, worn-out shepherd, played by Bill Kerr. The dog gives Kerr a reason for living, and vice versa. Be sure to have plenty of Kleenex handy for some of the mistier passages of Dusty.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/iSXf3CjdWvd8ANqmt5vX4Z5vQJz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kestrel Films","origin_country":""},{"id":11840,"logo_path":"/8oyCRYf6ezxB5h8HJIPVG8JjzgL.png","name":"Film Victoria","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1983-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Loyalty and Trust â€” The Winning Combination.","title":"Dusty","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
