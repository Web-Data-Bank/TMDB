About 2.5 million people standing in front of the pyramidical stage all the way down to the Arc de Triomphe witnessed this event, setting a new Guinness Book of Records entry for Jarre. The concert was funded by Mairie De Paris, Ministry of Culture and a small cluster of high-profile Parisian business concerns. Later, a concert video as well as a photobook of the event were released.  The show featured new tracks from the Waiting for Cousteau album, and vast grotesque marionettes created by Trinidadian Peter Minshall.","popularity":1.196,"poster_path":"/63CFlvBSQAJXh7atFCz4uEHgKzm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean-Michel Jarre - Paris, La Défense","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
