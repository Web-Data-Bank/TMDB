King Standing Room Only","overview":"He's reigned as the \"King of the Blues\" since the early '50s, yet B.B. King continues to wear the crown with dignity and class. This outstanding performance was recorded at the Trump Marina Hotel on the Boardwalk in Atlantic City. B.B. delivers the goods on classics. This performance once again confirms that B.B.
