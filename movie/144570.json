'The Professor' is a man who lives by his own personal version of the Ten Commandments. After miraculously surviving imprisonment in a Nazi concentration camp through a bit of ironic fate, he writes a memoir of his life, which becomes the target of the Soviet censors. The so-called \"freedom\" of Communism becomes just as oppressive as the German concentration camp.","popularity":1.896,"poster_path":"/w0n9pJrwQ0hy4uxDzSV1B79RWrr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74862,"logo_path":null,"name":"IMS 6 LLP","origin_country":""},{"id":3222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baltic Film Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2005-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest of the Gods","video":false,"vote_average":8.167,"vote_count":6}
