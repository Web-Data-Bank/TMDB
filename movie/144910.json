Brian Keith is an officer who tries to keep the peace. However, peace is hard to come by with Ernest Borgnine as a stereotypical dumb hick sheriff who's quick to call in the local militia. Tony Curtis plays a skirt-chasing sergeant who can't stay out of trouble and soon lands in jail. Brian Keith borrows a tank to release his friend from jail. Things get more chaotic after that.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/enKEVCsH5PR6CdTKcE0YIUy26NJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The motion picture that will melt your chocolate bar.","title":"Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came?","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
