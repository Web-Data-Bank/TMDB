Along with Sedaris, there are stories by the now-famous Tig Notaro, Glynn Washington, Ryan Knighton and David Rakoff. Lots of the stories are funny. David Rakoff's is particularly touching. He talks about the abilities heâ€™s lost during his fight with cancer, and then, gracefully, beautifully, does a solo dance onstage. It was the last story Rakoff ever wrote for the radio show. He died three months later, in August.  OK Go provides music. Monica Bill Barnes &amp; Company dance. Ira Glass tells a story using things he normally can't: photos. Mike Birbiglia casts Terry Gross in a surprising, hilarious little movie.","popularity":0.603,"poster_path":"/2sVpmKPAXbaZKvt4HWVWfDUTNaT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This American Life Live: The Invisible Made Visible","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
