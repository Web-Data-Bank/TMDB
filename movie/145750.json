Did so because I lived in South Africa years ago and thought it'd be interesting to see this South African filmed movie. Also, I am a boxing fan and recall Duane Bobick. What a big disappointment; I'm talking major! Duane Bobick just can't act. The poor guy is stiff, machine-like, almost a walking-talking robot. You can see how his face was battered by over 40 professional fights. The rest of the cast is just as bad. The story-line is a bizarre mix of romance, incest, sadism, and boxing. If you blink your eyes you can see a host of well-known boxers from South Africa in uncredited roles. Billyboy is not worth a 3 dollar rental,let alone the money I paid for it. I gave my copy away to a friend, who in turn sold it at a garage sale for a buck!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1978-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billyboy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
