The changing economics of farming lead Raoul, in late middle age, to decide to sell and move to Toulouse. At least two neighboring farmers want to buy Biquefarre: Lucien and the young Marcel. Behind the scenes, Henri, whose brother is Marcel's father and who is also Lucien's brother-in-law, negotiates with Raoul so that Marcel's father can secretly sweeten Marcel's offer. Will dad and uncle succeed? In the background is the hard daily work of farming: milking cows, harvesting at night, and finding help when a farmer falls ill. Progress brings challenges: polluted water, factory farms, and skyrocketing land prices.","popularity":1.125,"poster_path":"/jYcofdLhwPdqK8zifIrKSFT7pOi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9205,"logo_path":"/xgWTV26uLEhZALJ3BxN9WZtmDUw.png","name":"Midas Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biquefarre","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
