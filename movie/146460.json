The transition from being underground to mainstream has taken a long time (much longer if you just look at North America). For instance, the scene in the UK has been a prevalent part of their popular culture for over two decades. In 2012, EDM has reached a fever pitch, becoming the hottest ticket in music since Hip Hop in the late nineties. With the mainstreaming of electronic music it has opened up the gates of a broader critical look at the genre as a whole. The Drop is a documentary film exploring the EDM culture explosion. From the Artists, to the fans, to the business to the festivals, the Drop will follow all aspects of the growth of a genre of music that is defining today's generation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The EDM Culture Explosion.","title":"The Drop: The EDM Culture Explosion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
