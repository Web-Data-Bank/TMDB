Sent to the countryside, Abdel has to work on a farm, but Messaoud is taken in by a childless woman, who conceals his Arab origins from her fiercely Gaullist ex-army husband. Re-named Michel/Michou, and with his hair comically dyed blond, the young boy quickly steals the hearts of both foster-parents, and eventually is instrumental in saving their troubled marriage.","popularity":3.651,"poster_path":"/lWxoe9i8nqdBwKZFP9TAh5FkdZb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21321,"logo_path":null,"name":"MP Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6896,"logo_path":"/2Q89KvzxTKB5BAv9RqFIPI1qb7E.png","name":"EuropaCorp","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michou d'Auber","video":false,"vote_average":6.406,"vote_count":69}
