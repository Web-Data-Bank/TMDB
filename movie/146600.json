They know the bag they have isn't theirs because it is stuffed with 500 million lire. At first they put out an ad for the owner; then they decide to keep it for themselves. Mayhem ensues when the bag's thuggish owners suddenly show up at the couple's housewarming party and demand they give every penny back. Later when one of them returns to threaten the bride, she accidentally kills him. His partner and a policeman chase the couple into the mountain retreat of the bride's brother, a frustrated writer. He finds the mess inspiring, and then is assisted by the gangster's ghost, who becomes his muse. The ghost gives them the advice they need for the couple to safely escape.","popularity":0.76,"poster_path":"/u5T0Az4KhDEz4ggsGD1VgVSKeUJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7699,"logo_path":"/fHasfMWVRXGOmao2p1ijwicv9f4.png","name":"Palomar","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":20769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banfilm","origin_country":""},{"id":48819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Angel Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1995-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peggio di così si muore","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5}
