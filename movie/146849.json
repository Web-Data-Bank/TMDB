Venturing beyond the frontiers of most mountain films, Solitaire is backcountry skiing forged in the tradition of Western cinema. Born in the spires of Argentina’s legendary Las Lenas, a lonely two-year journey begins through an abandoned world, wandering the length of a continent from Peru’s Cordillera Blanca to Chilean Patagonia. Lost in the winds of snowbound badlands and the blizzards of primordial forests; seen from a horse’s saddle and a paraglider’s wings; ridden on ski and board and telemark...Solitaire fuses western-inspired tales of backcountry gambles into landscapes never before visited on film.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/fcmthwcV3TBYnxlUdeqv3H4Wdla.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19469,"logo_path":"/9J7UPjnJ0AanK0BJLYKmikrVUS1.png","name":"Sweetgrass Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From these most inhospitable of lands, a handful of drifters emerge","title":"Solitaire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
