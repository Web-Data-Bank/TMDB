The film's director was supposedly driven insane by it, but that doesn't deter horror fans, including Bridget and her boyfriend, Josh, from attending the showing. When the lights dim and the movie starts, they'd better prepare themselves for the scare of their lives. That's because they're not just going to be watching this bloodbath -- they're going to be starring in it.","popularity":5.05,"poster_path":"/w2vlJHUpmDmw4XIDRCPtqDvDeS4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bigfoot Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The New Face of Horror","title":"Midnight Movie","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":64}
