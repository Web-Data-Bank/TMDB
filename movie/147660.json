We went to his village in Kurdistan, a region brought to a standstill by war. At this place, loving someone can become confused with having a hold over them. It is with humor that the characters featured in this film find ways, within their community, to affirm that they truly exist. A shaman goes into trance in front of the television, a hermit dreams of marriage, a shepherdess wants to leave the top of the mountain, soldiers watch over the village, a man from Europe goes off to request the hand of a young woman. It is through these situations that we discover the reality of families doing what they can to find a way of living together, to take the best – or the worst – from each moment.","popularity":1.559,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kurdish Lover","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
