Filmed in both Manhattan and Brazil and set against the background of the Vietnam War and its protests, Hunger for Love uses a rigorously abstract soundtrack and narrative structure to evoke the acute paranoia of the period building up to the December 1968 military coup that tipped Brazil perilously close to a conservative dictatorship. With its harsh critique of the decadent tendencies of the Sixties counterculture, Hunger for Love offers a key expression of the self-consciously “ideological” phase of Cinema Novo. -Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0.846,"poster_path":"/xQRYHny5F1XIQBPv0uTVWYov2lR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Herbert Richers","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1968-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunger for Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":8}
