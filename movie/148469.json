One is on the making of \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\" and the other deals with \"She's A B**ch\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7pYyAn2HUvj6CZUkjGhDCuWOX24.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott: Hits of Miss E...
