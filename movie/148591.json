Ukkonen starts his crusade to bring the company down and get his revenge.  Nice quality for an independent production, even some special effects and some funny, overdramatic monologue by Ukkonen. Unfortunately the film is very short, lasting only about 20 minutes.  Worth checking out if you somehow find this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rZHxoNMi6G4KpyOArgz1PtekGfd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Level","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2001-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ukkonen","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":8}
