When Santa receives an emergency wish from a little boy in Los Angeles, he puts Christine on a special assignment, sending her to L.A. to give the VanCamp family—mom Sara (Eva La Rue), dad Scott (Dan Gauthier), and their two kids Ally (Izabela Vidovic) and Will (Mason Cook)—a holiday wake-up call. Will Christine fail her assignment and be sent back to the North Pole for good, or will the VanCamps come to their senses about the meaning of Christmas?","popularity":5.648,"poster_path":"/pXKUeppxOmRIgL2Qyt7tIKrNQUA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Larry Levinson Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":40666,"logo_path":null,"name":"PixL Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":11982,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ashton Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":11611,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mediapool Production","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"because elves, after all, deserve happiness, too","title":"Help for the Holidays","video":false,"vote_average":6.205,"vote_count":56}
