On Sunday 27th of September 1998 the Galway Footbal Team put stop to a famine that had lasted over three decades. In a thrilling encounter in Croke Park, Galway beat Kildare and were crowned 1998 All-Ireland Champions. For the first time in 32 years the Sam Maguire Cup was coming over the Shannon and back to Connaught.  A Year 'Til Sunday reveals what is involved for a panel of thirty young men, chosen by their county, who set off in quest of All-Ireland glory. This film goes beyond the sidelines and into the dressing room for the pre-match, half-time and full-time action. Over a period of 12 months, the palyers are followed through the agony of the training fields to the ecstasy of victory.  This unique, behind-the-scenes material reveals an insight to sport and life as never before seen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÃ‰","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Walk the walk!","title":"A Year 'til Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
