Jan Gassmann follows Christian Ziörjen’s (Chrigu) fight to live, in a film less about death, but about living life. Christian himself had been making his own films since the age of 16: at parties, concerts, on a trip to India, his camera was always with him. With “Chrigu”, filmmaker Jan Gassmann succeeds in creating a moving and surprising portrait of his best friend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oZTn8yFAPi48POqUTji1UClCOIB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2007-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chris","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
