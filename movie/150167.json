Who is Beta? follows two statuesque survivors drawn irresistibly together only to be entranced by the arrival and sudden disappearance of a third, the bewitching raven haired Beta. With its cartoon-like depiction of extreme violence and desire, Who is Beta? offers a heady Pop-infused companion to Hunger for Love. Yet beneath its giddy play of surfaces, dos Santos' underappreciated film gradually reveals a darkly ambiguous metaphoric dimension. -Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e5a3dtmu6ztRUclQFOmnwjR4o9A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regina Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":88404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dahlia Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1972-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Is Beta?","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7}
