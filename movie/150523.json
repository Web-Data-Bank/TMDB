This collection of ancient Sanskrit stories (composed into the longest book ever written) comprises a series of enlightened fables at the heart of countless beliefs, legends, and teachings; indeed, its very title means \"the great story of mankind.\" Brook and  writer Jean-Claude Carriere worked for eight years to develop this epic concerning two sides of a royal family, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, whose struggle leads to a fascinating voyage of emotions, passion and vision of glory. Briefly, the Mahabharata is a tale of two rival sets of brothers, cousins to eachother, each born into royalty and with divinely guided paths in life. The result, however, is a great war, death, destruction - a vast epic.","popularity":2.809,"poster_path":"/vshPIXZ6kpaazO6odS5WtWPoa2J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21321,"logo_path":null,"name":"MP Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":112338,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Brooklyn Academy of Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":318,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mahabharata","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":16}
