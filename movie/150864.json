While passionately devoted to humanity, he was happiest in the isolation of the dark room. A pioneer filmmaker (Manhatta, Native Land, Heart of Spain, The Wave), he found the process of collaboration painful. Strand established himself in New York in the 1920's as a master of light and structure, with his now famous photo of Wall Street inspired by the forms and movement of European modernist painters such as Matisse and Picasso. His closeup portraits and landscapes were equally profound. John Walker's Strand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zZ8caF0QS7p6wfKPCZ8qiquARuD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strand, Under the Dark Cloth","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
