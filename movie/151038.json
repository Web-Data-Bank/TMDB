He possessed a very personal touch combined with a unique harmonic style. He played in many different instrumental settings, but he is best remembered for his many trio recordings and his less numerous solo albums. A very introverted figure, Evans' life was tormented by an addiction to drugs that proved fatal. The selections on this DVD—taken from a single concert—show him performing marvelous music with the members of his last regular trio—bassist Marc Johnson and drummer Joe La Barbera—nearly a year and a half before his tragic and untimely death. Among the highlights are versions of Gary McFarland's waltz \"Gary's Waltz\" and of Bill Evans' own composition \"Turn Out the Stars\".\r Live in Iowa, January 30, 1979.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qQkCDzBkDFv9uChxKNqZLkkK406.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salt Peanuts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2008-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Evans:  But Beautiful","video":true,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
