On July 9, 2002, the Jazz Festival in Vienna was a great night of gypsy jazz. It was a sold-out show, with eight thousand people packed on the stone steps of the sumptuous Theater Antique. They came to admire the greatest prodigies of this music, since the passing of the master, Django. Surrounded by his good friends - bassist Diego Imbert, rhythm guitarists Hono Winterstein and Thomas Dutronc, and violinist Florin Niculescu - Biréli Lagrène plays with stellar musical technique, virtuosity, speed, and great emotion.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":"/fYmAxCsRsbBPedSZK8ehtm2BcKP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18435,"logo_path":null,"name":"Disques Dreyfus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bireli Lagrene & Friends  Live Jazz A Vienne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
