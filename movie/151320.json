A musically conceived piece, referencing the video operas of Robert Ashley, the film explores the social imaginary of a utopian landscape through directed attention to the voices that inhabit it.Treating the medium of film as both a musical proposition and a proposal for collective production, A Necessary Music employs the resident of New York’s Roosevelt Island as its authors and actors, gathering together texts written by them and using them to construct a script for the film. Framed by a fictional narration taken from Adolfo Bioy Casares’ 1941 science fiction novel ‘The invention of Morel’, the film self-consciously dissolves from attempted realism to imagined narrative; what begins as a enthnographic study becomes instead an imagined fiction and an investigation into the mechanics of representation itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Necessary Music","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
