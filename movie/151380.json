They are on a journey back to the battlefield, the site of the last \"great\" battle of the Cold War - its inconclusive and a very secret Armageddon, where they as youngsters, once tried to kill each other. But now, twenty years later, they've come together as former enemies, a new unit of disparate souls joined together not only by the common haunting of war trauma, but also by their need to understand, to reconcile, to forgive.","popularity":0.907,"poster_path":"/i1LATZZwKu1vfA16AKp7Xfi6NPY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eden Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Four war-veterans, former enemies journey back to past battlefields deep within the African interior in search of reconciliation, forgiveness and ... atonement?","title":"My Heart of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
