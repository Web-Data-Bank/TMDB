Existentialist rather than optimist, the approach is one of humanistic atheism, accepting death as part of life. Interviews with doctors and nurses explore their outlook; all speak of death as a fact, without either sentimentality or religiosity. The studied objectivity of the film only imperfectly hides an intense emotionality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha – Studio dokumentárních filmů","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1966-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A multilayered documentary film draws the viewer into a hospital environment, where we meet not only patients, with their fears, pains, and joys, but also doctors.","title":"Reflection","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
