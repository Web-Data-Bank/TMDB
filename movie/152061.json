Debut director Pourya Azarbayjani presents the tales of several women who spend much of the film alone on the streets of Tehran after dark – a particularly fraught place for unescorted women in a Muslim nation.  The film's three primary stories each represents a different point in the cycles of courtship and childbirth. One young woman hopes to elope with her unseen fiance, but faces insurmountable problems when he doesn't show up. An older, married woman seeks to buy a pregnancy test, the results of which could dictate her marriage's fate. A new mother at a hospital resorts to drastic measures when a financial problem arises.\r (c) http://clatl.com/atlanta/iranian-film-today/Content?oid=1275194","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6WxphQJ1Danbk1y96A9GGIelvF9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unfinished Stories","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
