Eddy Ko is the maverick star pupil of an honorable school who secretly engages in underground \"Black Boxing\" bouts, a black market sport off limits to the school. The ambitious X-Gang, a bloodthirsty neo-Nazi-like organization, plots to take care of Ko and his friends and take over the city with their army of mind-controlled zombie soldiers. In true Hong Kong fashion, it boils down to a showdown of champions, and this one takes place in a boxing ring in an eerily empty warehouse with video coverage broadcasting the event all over.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":"/96vHLuc6K0zDdZsMNGfj0ZrJorc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46825,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bang Bang Film Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":147901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Verdull Film Dept.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1983-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The battle for survival rages in a computer-run world.","title":"Flash Future Kung Fu","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6}
