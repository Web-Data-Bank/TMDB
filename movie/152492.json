But in October 2008, less than a decade after Fred Goodwin took over as chief executive, it came within hours of collapsing. RBS later posted the biggest loss in UK corporate history - 24 billion pounds - which damaged the bank's reputation for financial prudence and Scotland's image as a global financial centre. Using previously unbroadcast footage of the bank's top executives and interviews with bank insiders, this documentary tells the compelling story of a national catastrophe.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RBS: Inside the Bank That Ran Out of Money","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
