Johnny Ears (Franco Nero) and his deaf-mute sidekick Erastus \"Deaf\" Smith (Anthony Quinn) go after a Mexican general (Franco Graziosi) under orders from Germany to agitate the populace. The film looks terrific, thanks to cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli (Once Upon a Time in America), but is often lacking in the story department. Perhaps part of the blame belongs to co-screenwriter Harry Essex, fresh off the dreadful sci-fi flop Octaman (1971). Pamela Tiffin appears as a prostitute, and the film co-stars Tom Felleghy and Renato Romano.","popularity":3.211,"poster_path":"/7rDxCIEuzAtSfEpMDFWco2yZe7n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Idea Film","origin_country":""},{"id":44722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnia Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1973-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The man who hears with his eyes and speaks with his gun...","title":"Deaf Smith & Johnny Ears","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":8}
