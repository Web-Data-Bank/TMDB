The twentysomething Lisbon resident has been hailed as the successor to fado legend Am√°lia Rodrigues; now, after two well-received CDs, comes Mariza's first filmed concert performance, and it is stunning. Mariza is backed primarily by acoustic guitar, acoustic bass guitar, and \"Portuguese guitar,\" a 12-string instrument that looks something like a lute and sounds a bit like a Greek bouzouki; there is some piano as well, and Guy Barker's muted trumpet provides \"O Deserto\" with a pronounced jazzy feel. But the singer is the main attraction here, and the power and passion of Mariza's delivery on \"Barco Negro\" and nearly all the others in the 16-song set, including more upbeat, celebratory numbers like \"Oica La o Senhor Vinho\" (the introductions are in English, but the tunes are all in Portuguese) are undeniable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6wFHLr9LgHjKqFUEm9LwyWIP3r4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mariza: Live in London","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
