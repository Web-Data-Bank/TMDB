To prove it he's looking for a greenhorn that can be turned into a candidate. A call is put out for would-be participants, and hundreds apply. A small group is selected and under go training. Polish master Marcel Lozinksi followed Tymochowicz and this project for three years, and this beautifully shot and edited work paints a compelling portrait of cynical (and quite familiar) demagogy and populism in action.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iXjGIVS6eWoXBDPEBoLxWyvp4I5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Kalejdoskop","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2006-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How It's Done","video":false,"vote_average":6.125,"vote_count":4}
