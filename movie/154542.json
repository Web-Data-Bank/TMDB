Three nights and seven sets of classic Umphrey’s McGee are now available for your viewing pleasure. Clocking in at almost nine and a half hours of music (gulp), these performances are raw, live and awesome. Live From The Pageant also contains unreleased bonus material from the Death By Stereo live in-studio webcast.  Both the video and audio were captured in real time, as it happened – no remixing, editing, 5.1 mixes or other blemish-reducing measures. What you saw is what you get.  Settle in and get after it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Umphrey's McGee: Live From the Pagent, NYE Weekend 2011","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
