For 10 months, director Michael Kleiman lived in small villages in the Andes Mountains and Amazon Jungle in Peru. While there, he lived with families and documented the villagers’ first experience with computers and the Internet via the One Laptop per Child program. As the children and their parents engage with communications technologies for the first time, the film is a deeply relevant consideration of the digital world we find ourselves in, the tremendous implications we are beginning to see all around us, and the changing definition of connection – both remote technological connection and face-to-face human connection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wG3vHyRAx93QvpltrJR36k3gl3E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Web","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
