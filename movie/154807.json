In addition to this Tilburg concert, fans can experience extracts from London's 2011 High Voltage Festival with Michael Voss (vocals), plus awe-inspiring guest appearances from Schenker's friends and musical companions including his brother Rudolf Schenker (The Scorpions), ex-Journey singer Jeff Scott Soto, and UFO bassist Pete Way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oPwS9if12fpreDCku2YyUAJQQvf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael Schenker: Temple Of Rock - Live in Europe","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
