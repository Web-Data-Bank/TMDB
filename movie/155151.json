While still in high school, Pickett and Prueher began collecting videos from garage sales, training videos from odd jobs, and copies of tapes from a video production house. The friends would then play selections from this collection for entertainment at parties. In 2004, Pickett and Prueher quit their day jobs to focus on production of their first feature documentary, Dirty Country. They started the touring Found Footage Festival show to fund the production of the documentary. In addition to its regular touring schedule, the Festival has appeared at the HBO US Comedy Arts Festival, Just For Laughs (the Montreal comedy festival), the New York Comedy Festival, the Impakt Festival in the Netherlands, and the Central Standard Film Festival in Minneapolis, MN. The Festival is currently based out of New York City.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fi6CyGgGRBi0JLtqLp0qPmx0Zj5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A celebration of odd and hilarious found videos!","title":"Found Footage Festival Volume 4: Live in Tucson","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
