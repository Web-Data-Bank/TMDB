When you're used to spending your day inventing the most cutting edge spy equipment known to man, adapting the stealth and guile needed to become a true secret agent doesn't come naturally. Unfortunately the invisibility cloak that the pair recently collaborated on has disappeared, and in order to ensure that it doesn't fall into the hands of KAOS they will have to master the skills of a true spy. But how exactly does one find an object that's invisible to begin with? As the search gets underway, these brainy inventors are given an eye-opening crash course in high-level espionage.","popularity":6.843,"poster_path":"/qvEYqTCbFVc0qaqDW3eSsa6TKTK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mosaic Media Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mad Chance","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4811,"logo_path":"/7xym5CnL4LcMPaWpp51cN1v73AR.png","name":"Warner Premiere","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Loved Get Smart?
