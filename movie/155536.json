The film portrays people who have a close relationship with a robot, and it takes us from the high temple of robot technology, Tokyo, Japan, to Braunschweig, Germany, to Italy and back to Copenhagen, Denmark. By this world tour director Phie Ambo seeks to highlight the human need for love and our craving to be loved by others - perhaps the two most important aspects of life. Through the main characters, she examines the cultural differences in how we accept emotional robots in the East and the West.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5vIg4CGaF73tcqBtgoq8RjcyvAG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mechanical Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
