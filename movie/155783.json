Pinatubo. With their settlements being closer to the government-funded schools of the Kapampangan townships, the Aeta children now have the opportunity to study. Jonalyn, one of the elementary school graduates of the ceremony depicted in the confused introduction and an Aeta, seeks to teach her elders to read and write a day before the National Elections. With Jonalyn's effort, the Aetas, for the very first time, have participated in the democratic process that has existed in the Philippines since the early part of the 20th century.  source: http://oggsmoggs.blogspot.com/2006/11/manoro-2006.html","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bcH0WfQVCOLdpk1No1FUJJjZexo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19505,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadrunner Network","origin_country":""},{"id":7008,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centerstage Productions","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":43428,"logo_path":null,"name":"Holy Angel University Center for Kapampangan Studies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2006-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The teacher.","title":"Manoro","video":false,"vote_average":8.1,"vote_count":4}
