Standing in their way are two clans who posses a magic mirror each. The two clans enjoy friendly relations, but when one mirror is stolen and the blame seems to rest with the other Clan, suspicions and tempers run high. It’s left to the young renegades from each Clan to find the true culprit or culprits, and to ease the tensions of their families. Not to mention ridding the world of the evil Jiuxian Witch.","popularity":0.9,"poster_path":"/mhtXFCrgA7hFh092E7gltXt0JTK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1972-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Mirror","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":7}
