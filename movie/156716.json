The result is their most accomplished work yet. \"The beats are sparse and liquid, and the transition from Buenos Aires bordello to European dance floor is seamless\" - Rolling Stone. \"A jiggy melange of tango with a dab of dub\" - Entertainment Weekly. \"...an intriguing blend of traditional, passionate tango with cool, contemporary electronica\" - LA Times.
