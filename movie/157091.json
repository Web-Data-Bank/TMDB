The scene eventually begins to warp and disintegrate. The result is equal parts mind-numbing and hypnotic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runaway","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":8}
