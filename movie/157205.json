Given the very tough topic of social deprivation, extreme poverty and shockingly appalling living conditions, I expected \"Cageman\" to be very tough to watch. This turns out not to be the case. Instead, \"Cageman\" is a warm, positive and loving film about friendship. People in the caged housing live as harmonious as possible, supporting each other by their limited means.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/kQZaaMJOdrXe4MGd9L5BqUURu5j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmagica Productions Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1992-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cageman","video":false,"vote_average":6.571,"vote_count":7}
