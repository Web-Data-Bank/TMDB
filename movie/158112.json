Over the course of a year, we follow her through her discontents: Antonio's lateness, his fatigue when she wants to make love, his insistence on her company when she prefers solitude, his treating her work as less important than his, his casual and cruel dismissal of her opinions, her boss assigning her an incompetent editor, bartenders ignoring her, her passage into middle age. She can be feisty and edgy, which sometimes gets in the way of what would make her happy. And she regularly threatens to leave Antonio. Will she, and on what terms? What will he do?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/e1cwOcr14KXdeYsd33JHGBCVoFy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1991-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Be a Woman and Not Die in the Attempt","video":false,"vote_average":5.765,"vote_count":17}
