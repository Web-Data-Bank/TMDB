Today as nearly one third of all US babies are born via C-section, they fight to protect their knowledge and to promote respectful, safe maternity practices all over the globe. From the backs of their technicolor school buses, these pioneers rescued American midwifery from extinction, changed the way a generation approached pregnancy, and filmed nearly everything they did. With unprecedented access to the midwives' archival video collection, as well as modern day footage of life at the alternative intentional community where they live, this documentary shows childbirth the way most people have never seen it--unadorned, unabashed, and awe-inspiring.","popularity":3.376,"poster_path":"/6hvZkYh8QIGeIaBQhOeRh0qpqDu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ghost Robot","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birth Story: Ina May Gaskin and the Farm Midwives","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
