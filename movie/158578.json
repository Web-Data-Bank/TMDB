Fourteen year-old Wanda moves with her family from Berlin to Switzerland. Everything will be better here. The move is meant to heal the open wounds of the family. Anna, the mother, has lost her self-confidence due to an affair her husband Joachim had in Berlin. The big house with the overgrown garden and the pretty small town all seems like one big promise. But the new beginning is difficult for everyone. Joachim, 40, throws himself into family activism while Anna, also 40, tries to strengthen the family with new rituals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ArxY1SMQpr0CDhAHLH0QbcQiIfj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65263,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zum Goldenen Lamm Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":6663,"logo_path":"/gVL9spqQwwCQPly6moVVWuofouy.png","name":"C-Films","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2012-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Outside","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
