Cairo’s Tahrir Square is the heart and soul of the film, which follows several young activists. Armed with values, determination, music, humor, an abundance of social media, and sheer obstinacy, they know that the thorny path to democracy only began with Hosni Mubarak’s fall. The life-and-death struggle between the people and the power of the state is still playing out.","popularity":5.314,"poster_path":"/fbhmYUTdRgnFvumVewTCLgbvYm9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roast Beef Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":9015,"logo_path":"/pRQLCm8AAPXL7H9MzX4xuS8GGg8.png","name":"Worldview Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":27197,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noujaim Films","origin_country":""},{"id":121268,"logo_path":"/vPtiQxlA2S3Z77eduT6TFqBG9NE.png","name":"The Othrs","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The people demand the downfall of the regime","title":"The Square","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":130}
