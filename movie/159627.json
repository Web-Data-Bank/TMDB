This might prove to be her biggest task so far, but also the one that will bring her renown. She brings along her son, Justin, who was recently involved in a car accident with his father. In the wilderness outside Los Angeles, the two of them find a man named Michael Brandeis, who seems to know an awful lot about what is happening. As expected, these are not natural earthquakes, but the work of a dangerous company selling nuclear weapons.","popularity":1.445,"poster_path":"/xjzm5F3vvdGJwbyRnprPpF2fB1A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156671,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wishing Star Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":28864,"logo_path":"/h9SuMmWNAaKNqCx0AJ58Qrn8ILz.png","name":"PorchLight Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":18298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Videal GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ground Zero","video":false,"vote_average":2.9,"vote_count":7}
