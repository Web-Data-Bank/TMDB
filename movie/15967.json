Sarah graciously offers Caroline a tiny room in her apartment and decides to help her find Mr. Right. Caroline isn't sure she's cut out for the dating game, but Sarah assures her there's nothing to it. Caroline is sent on a series of grueling and comic dates with everything from nimble pickup artists, to adventure sports freaks and a karaokesinging stockbroker. But in the end what the two sisters really find is themselves.","popularity":0.675,"poster_path":"/1yGxaYpPWVntqMg8g0NAV2KjHBC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeitgeist","origin_country":""},{"id":76,"logo_path":"/nebkQYtQKhZyHJfh5v0oGpNbPzu.png","name":"Zentropa Entertainments","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2003-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rule No. 1","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
