It begins with footage from a stylish old potboiler about an isolated convent, whose tale of passions leashed and unleashed provides the leitmotif for a young lesbian who watches it and the lonely nun she pursues and seduces. As the two women's lives come closer to joining, voiceovers from the biography of a 16th century lesbian nun and the reminiscences of a woman's closeted romances at a Catholic school flesh out the theme. When the two women finally meet and make love, the woman's careful unwrapping of the nun's complicated prison of clothing is both foreplay and liberating metaphor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xexMvCBH0S6nv0U98JgAQ47DPFI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Damned If You Don't","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":6}
