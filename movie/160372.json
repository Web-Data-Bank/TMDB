Whenever a match is broadcast live in the village of Makono, Bandian and his brother keep their ears to the transistor radio, spinning a picture of the game from the announcer's commentary much as they fantasize themselves on the field. A gift of a real soccer ball, which Bandian paints gold, like a magical object involves him in a series of adventures which bring him in reach of his dream, but which also require him to make difficult choices.","popularity":2.435,"poster_path":"/ukjN0Zv8V32JsorQYEpP2y6PbKX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chrysalide Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GN","name":"Guinea"}],"release_date":"1994-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golden Ball","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":39}
