His friends Mathias, a dumb jock, and Kathrine, who only comes to spend time wear her dad, who really wanted a boy, prefer childish fun, but get dragged in his quest for a treasure. Mats's strength, Kathrine's connections and even Nis's bratty kid sister's blunt remarks contribute to find out about two brotherhoods, heirs of 12th century factions in the Templar order and deal with danger.","popularity":2.281,"poster_path":"/snHsYUnPuQcxxJUKWlGZiLlSxo9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1789,"logo_path":null,"name":"M\u0026M Productions","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2006-02-03","revenue":9984,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Treasure of the Knights Templar","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":33}
