The moments that spring immediately to mind include some very funny sketches with Betty White, a superb comedienne. And besides being a great musician, Doc Severinsen can be very funny, as you'll see when he shares a Thanksgiving memory of the past.  Wild Kingdom's Jim Fowler and Joan Embry of the San Diego Zoo managed to bring to the show wildlife of every kind. One of the most requested involved a marmoset which showed no respect whatsoever.  Jimmy Stewart - what a class act! When Jimmy read a poem dedicated to his dog, it generated the most requests ever!  So sit back, relax and enjoy these special moments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d9rSyJR2d4viiSnH8dFBdAmtciO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnny Carson - His Favorite Moments from 'The Tonight Show' - '70s & '80s: The Master of Laughs!","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
