Some of today's top comedy stars made their Tonight debuts around this time. Roseanne Arnold was just a Domestic-Goddess-in-Training when she first appeared on the show. Other great comics like Steve Martin, George Carlin, and Albert Brooks continued to visit, and I'm delighted with their success.  This volume reminds me that our batting average with talking or singing birds was not good. Once they got in front of the lights, they clammed up like captured spies - except Pancho the Parrot.  This month of May, 1992, was an emotional one for all of us. Many friends dropped in to say goodbye. The program of May 21, 1992, provided some electric moments. My final guest was Bette Midler, and the memory of that night will be with me forever.  I hope you enjoy all the fond memories in this volume.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7DPSIcmdey96WrOAESizyS1rrk0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnny Carson - His Favorite Moments from 'The Tonight Show' - '80s & '90s: The King of Late Night","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
