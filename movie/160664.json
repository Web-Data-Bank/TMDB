Everywhere he applies for work, he is rejected. The reason is his last name. He also fails as a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. As a salesman he makes a house call and lets himself be nibbled by the green widow Clothilde Rieker. When suddenly the husband comes home, he has to flee, wrapped in an orange bed sheet. In doing so, he is mistaken by a reception committee for the announced guru. From now on he resides as a guru in the castle of Countess Falkenberg. Jakob's friend Tommi turns this delusion into a lively source of money.","popularity":0.9,"poster_path":"/2Kj3WplnbYUPntAuDZUGc53K2SC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29797,"logo_path":null,"name":"KF Kinofilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die unglaublichen Abenteuer des Guru Jakob","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
