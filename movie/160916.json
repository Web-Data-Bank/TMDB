She is sent by her mom to spend a month of her summer holidays with her grandparents on the family farm. While there she develops a love-hate relationship with her grandfather Joseph, a full- blooded Cree Indian who stresses rules and respect. Slowly her grandfather introduces her to traditions he learned on the reserve as a boy.

In the end the story is about redemptive love and the power of forgiveness woven into the traditions of First Nations culture.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Broken Yet Brave","title":"Run, Broken Yet Brave","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
