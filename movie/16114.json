First created for Flatley's last show as the \"Lord of the Dance\", the show was a one-off performance in London's Hyde Park on July 25, 1998, playing to approximately 25,000 people. The show itself closely resembles its predecessor, Lord of the Dance. However Feet of Flames doubles the dancers, adds new numbers, and a new stage with multi-level tiers for the dancers. Amongst the new numbers is Flatley's solo â€” \"Feet of Flames\", which the show is based around. The show introduced some of the key elements that are now featured when Flatley performs. His silver-heeled shoes made by Freed's of London were used for the first time in this show. TV screens on both sides of the stage were also installed and now used in all the shows that feature Flatley","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/eKs5VoQVh7emQFwkLhevgkTQ4GC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feet of Flames","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":7}
