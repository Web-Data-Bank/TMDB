She explores who he is and how he got there, working back and forth between archival and contemporary footage. Born in 1932 in Brooklyn, busking through the South and West in the early 50s, a year with Woody Guthrie, six years flatpicking in Europe, a triumphant return to Greenwich Village in the early 60s, mentoring Bob Dylan, then life on the road, from gig to gig, singing and telling stories. A Grammy and the National Medal of Arts await Jack near the end of a long trail. What will Aiyana find for herself?","popularity":1.033,"poster_path":"/kiZyaUQ3ttt15FK9SKR8Tn0Xj42.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crawford Communications","origin_country":""},{"id":2291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Journeyman Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":22567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plantain Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":22632,"logo_path":null,"name":"Verisimilitude","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"After Woody Guthrie and before Bob Dylan came Ramblin' Jack Elliott.","title":"The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":3}
