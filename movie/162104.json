His girlfriend Annette says that she will marry him only if he can stay employed for at least a week. Hired by Mr Grimwood's cleaning company \"Here To Service You\", Gil is unwittingly drawn into a series of bawdy misadventures: sharing a bath with a married woman and getting caught by her husband; having a threesome with a hospital patient and a woman doctor, followed by a foursome with Annette, Grimwood and a woman psychologist; awkward encounters with a gay man and a lesbian; and getting caught by Annette playing strip poker with a group of women. Incredibly, Gil remains in his job and Annette marries him, but before the couple can have their wedding night Gil collapses on the bed and passes out from exhaustion.","popularity":1.111,"poster_path":"/iuhCC8EdAmAfkgkdmd3QTWGJwkt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Can You Keep It Up for a Week?","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5}
