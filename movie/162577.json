When Minnie is captured by a bird's song, Mickey hides in his bird-house and pretends to be a bird himself, until a cat attacks and blows his cover. Then he does a dance while wearing the house; their song attracts more birds, and again the cat. Pluto chases, but he's still pulling the lawnmower, and it causes much destruction.","popularity":1.83,"poster_path":"/9cyOHHpukK3SQ9S1BiybUOluafw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1931-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mickey Cuts Up","video":false,"vote_average":5.444,"vote_count":27}
