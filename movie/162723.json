In it, the now almost unknown Kyiv of 1929 appears. Shots of the awakening of the city, renewal of its life, echo with lyrical pictures of the revival of nature. Kaufman's attentive camera stops for a long time on the smiling faces of the children, painting a lyrical picture of a confession of love for Kyiv.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/7QZy2UT5C5JZLDktXQW3X7KSyBU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/y1qBEXTFKt1TvGKKH9QAYiP3rPe.png","name":"VUFKU (All-Ukrainian Photo-Cinema Administration)","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1929-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Spring","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":10}
