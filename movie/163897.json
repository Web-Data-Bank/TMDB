Murphyâ€™s feature length experimental film is a meditation on light, chemistry, and the properties of photographic emulsion and can therefore be identified as a structuralist film. Beginning with points of red light, the film takes a single minute of film and reprints in over and over, moving through several levels of abstraction, then returning to them. Winner of several experimental film festival awards.","popularity":0.931,"poster_path":"/8WLU1lyzQxeEvZ23KA8qfisV6e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Print Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
