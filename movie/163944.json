This poetic tale begins with the locals' stories of Mohan, the feared river god known to lure fishermen into the water's depths, entangling their nets and stealing their fish. In time, a more frightening reality emerges, one that even the powerful Mohan now hides from, as the stories shift to the violence inflicted upon residents by Colombia's paramilitaries. Recounting the memories of lost loved ones who now rest beneath the surface of the Magdalena, this documentary is the second entry in the Campo Hablado trilogy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Embrace of the River","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
