Gordon Hempton is an Emmy Award-winning sound recordist who has spent the last 30 years trying to find and record the vanishing sounds of nature in an attempt to capture a disappearing sensory experience. Filmmaker Nick Sherman observes Hempton in the wilderness for 30 days and uncovers an obsessive artist on a quest for perfection in this obscure medium. Hempton’s natural ability to locate and articulate himself through sound has a contagious energy and gives his work a transportive quality. Soundtracker is a fascinating meditation on the world’s changing landscape and the things we may be leaving behind in the service of progress.","popularity":0.603,"poster_path":"/kteHNZrK1ZbXCoQSbg6Fdjo2EtL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soundtracker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
