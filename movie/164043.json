The film provides a personal glimpse of some of America's favorite actors as they step out of their comfort zones--from Cheyenne Jackson's \"fear, sweat, adrenaline and Red Bull\" to Rachel Dratch's mounting dread at the prospect of singing alongside Broadway's finest voices. Richard Kind sums it up: \"It's like a roller-coaster. You're terrified, but it's fun!\" Watching this insane theatrical challenge keeps you on the edge of your seat and laughing.","popularity":1.737,"poster_path":"/4thj0YN823EN13uXpmeYboAq3ls.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the blank page to the live stage, all within 24 hours.","title":"One Night Stand","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
