This family gathering provides the occasion for a dinner together, at which other relatives appear over the course of the day. While the family members animate the apartment’s space with their conversations, everyday activities and cooking preparations, the cat and dog range through the various rooms. they too become a central element in this quotidian familial dance that repeatedly manifests stylized elements, disrupting any naturalistic mode of presentation. In this way, adjoining spaces open up between family drama, fairy tale and the psychological study of a mother.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/nXsvN2QrwEJXJBNDW5WGqxrPZHl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strange Little Cat","video":false,"vote_average":6.435,"vote_count":23}
