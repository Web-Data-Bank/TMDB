This is not one of those times... Gram Parsons was one of the most influential musicians of his time; a bitter, brilliant, genius who knew Elvis, tripped with the Stones and fatally overdosed on morphine and tequila in 1973. And from his dying came a story. A story from deep within folklore; a story of friendship, honour and adventure; a story so extraordinary that if it didn't really happen, no one would believe it. Two men, a hearse, a dead rock star, five gallons of petrol, and a promise. And the most extraordinary chase of modern times.","popularity":4.344,"poster_path":"/5sWWj5tlTDyAi2yiEjQZUmJCoKr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-18","revenue":6876,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's better to burn out than to fade away.","title":"Grand Theft Parsons","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":26}
