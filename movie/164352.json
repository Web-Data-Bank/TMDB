The psychologist, Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), himself made such an expedition to survey the world of symbols and archetypes, asking about their relevance for our lives.  How do \"Nachtmeerfahrten\" appear today?  Are they dangerous in some ways and which potential do they have?  What are our spirits (\"anima\") and shadows telling us thereby?  Does the imagines of our subconsciousness contain spiritual messages?  This is a filmic journey to the biography of C. G. Jung and to the mighty world of myths, dreams and symbols.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yonHWdMSLpSSVMY2n4uXdMVYPUK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atalante Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nachtmeerfahrten","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
