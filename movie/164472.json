At its heart is Naseby, a town of character and community, bound together by their love of curling. They hunger for hard frosts and freezing lakes but their passion for ice is now been tested. A changing climate means that curling outdoors may soon become a thing of the past and these passionate curlers may never again be able to compete for New Zealand's oldest sporting trophy - the Baxter's Cup.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not just a game.
