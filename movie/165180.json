Can is a small-time dealer and errand-boy for drug boss Hakan, who has to keep his customers supplied within his narrowly staked out territory. Jale, who works in the ware-house of a department store, has been pressing Can to give up this activity. Can, also fed up with his situation, sees a bright new beginning for himself and his family when Hakan offers him the prospective chance to run a bar on his very own. But Can has little control over the pressures that gradually begin to build up around him and soon finds himself floundering in quicksand.","popularity":1.617,"poster_path":"/frgv1RknzDjSIhgBnrofiD7JDj9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2662,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trans-Film","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dealer","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":10}
