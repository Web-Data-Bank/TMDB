The seven days of the voyage are recorded by the lenses of the tourists who film everything, all the time. By casting its eyes on how the characters see things, the film is revealed to be an essay on the production of images in contemporary society and their political implications. In addition it throws the spotlight on a reflection on Brazilian society, using a social group rarely seen and one that is well beyond the stereotypes commonly observed in documentaries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/37Gg7kBhyk5atTATdL2wctCTfZ6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2009-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pacific","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1}
