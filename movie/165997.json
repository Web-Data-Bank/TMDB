This blatant rip-off of Disney's Mickey Mouse is indeed a fascinating effort. Not only is it most agreeably quaint, but it's remarkably fast-paced. And even better still, it's visually well-stocked with a host of neat gags. The superbly integrated music score rates as an outstandingly entertaining bonus.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5kFxyzhP4aAywDqNDkPcZRRu8b0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Beuren Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Office Boy","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
