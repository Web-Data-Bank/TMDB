We see underwater swimmers representing this. He is young, in a jungle setting, with two fanciful \"instincts\" guiding him as swooping bird-like acrobats initially menace, then delight. As an adolescent, he enters a desert, where a man spins a large cube of metal tubing. He leaves his instinct-guides behind, and enters a garden where two statues dance in a pond. As he watches their sensual acrobatics of love, he becomes a man. He is offered wealth (represented by a golden hat) by a devil figure. In a richly decorated room, a scruffy troupe of a dozen acrobats and a little girl reawaken the old man's youthful nature and love.","popularity":3.164,"poster_path":"/h2kFMJNhC9q1gL8YESKqW3yIouF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cirque du Soleil Images","origin_country":""},{"id":40414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cirque du Soleil: Journey of Man","video":false,"vote_average":7.08,"vote_count":25}
