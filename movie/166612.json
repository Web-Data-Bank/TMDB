Based on a play by Owen Davis Sr., the film  casts Errol as James Wilson, a kleptomaniac who starts with picking  pockets and ends up robbing a bank. Wilson's friend Lawrence Payne  (Richard Arlen) inadvertently aids our hero during one of his heists,  ending up in deep doo-doo with the law. Before Wilson is able to  extricate Payne from his dilemma for the sake of heroine Barbara Tanner  (Mary Brian), he pauses long enough to pose as a private eye -- and even  gives bellboy Oscar (Stu Erwin) tips on how to spot a crook! If only all of  Leon Errol's feature films had been as consistently hilarious as Only Saps  Work.","popularity":1.374,"poster_path":"/ftmL7tEik2mKg3PgGwH2aXiZuFu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We Promise -- You'll Shake With Laughter!","title":"Only Saps Work","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
