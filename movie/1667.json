They walk, marching day and night in single file 70 miles into the darkest, driest and coldest continent on Earth.  This amazing, true-life tale is touched with humour and alive with thrills. Breathtaking photography captures the transcendent beauty and staggering drama of devoted parent penguins who, in the fierce polar winter, take turns guarding their egg and trekking to the ocean in search of food. Predators hunt them, storms lash them. But the safety of their adorable chicks makes it all worthwhile. So follow the leader... to adventure!!","popularity":7.532,"poster_path":"/o9xJ1xG1WKlHkl8ACqq0LShOuMu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":856,"logo_path":"/z0vTTWBhZggM09oZWSY3hbXgPKv.png","name":"Wild Bunch","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8661,"logo_path":null,"name":"APC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":66329,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Institut Polare Français Paul-Émile Victor","origin_country":""},{"id":66331,"logo_path":"/n2gAOEA4q6bUiaHwo2mKWHGA1wm.png","name":"Bonne Pioche","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":114038,"logo_path":"/hgVQE5KwqBhYPKLC9lZmE6zarco.png","name":"National Geographic Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":11509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Independent Pictures (WIP)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":135745,"logo_path":"/uVLvZaUx7lw1K5d2dfOjYrbcpKd.png","name":"The Walt Disney Company France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-26","revenue":127392693,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the harshest place on Earth, love finds a way.","title":"March of the Penguins","video":false,"vote_average":7.012,"vote_count":1004}
