The cases plagued the city until 1982, when Wayne Wiiliams was convicted of the murders of two adult men. Authorities then considered the other cases closed. Some of the parents of the slain children were critical of the way the cases were handled and believed there was some sort of cover up. Nearly four years after the conviction of Williams, \"Spin\" magazine editor Ron Larson and reporter Pat Laughlin come to Atlanta in search of the truth.","popularity":2.529,"poster_path":"/hyG0vFNl4z9qctDe3R2ZoYYO0v5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Babelsberg International Film Produktion","origin_country":""},{"id":4343,"logo_path":"/rXq1B1Hnkdnw6soz1zoGcslK3wb.png","name":"Showtime Networks","origin_country":"US"},{"id":23308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victor \u0026 Grais Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":186212,"logo_path":null,"name":"South Side Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Killed Atlanta's Children?","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":11}
