But in a rigid society ruled by an uneasy alliance of aristocracy and clergy already undermined by the Plague and the Reformation, science is a threat and enlightenment is a luxury. Faced with either death at the hands of the Inquisition or recantation to a hypocritical but all-powerful Papacy, Galileo must choose between his own life and the restless scientific curiosity that he has spurned family, friends, and wealth to pursue.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/xLZb3WikNTGulOXNX93d4GsgZp4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20151,"logo_path":null,"name":"The American Film Theatre","origin_country":""},{"id":73904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinévision Ltée","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Galileo","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":11}
