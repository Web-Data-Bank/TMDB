The shy Elizabeth is overwhelmed by Brazilian sensuality. She is the antithesis to Mary’s dashing partner, architect Lota de Macedo Soares. Mary is jealous, but unconventional Lota is determined to have both women at all costs. This eternal triangle plays out against the backdrop of the military coup of 1964. Bishop’s moving poems are at the core of a film which lushly illustrates a crucial phase in the life of this influential Pulitzer prize-winning poet.","popularity":5.516,"poster_path":"/qTatiV0yzfLFLbBsFARNFYnTidL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7765,"logo_path":"/kyZyb7enWovBqmhIZNbseIT9GZI.png","name":"TeleImage","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":13118,"logo_path":"/cHKq00BCpqb4tLSMkoD48TZ6IyO.png","name":"LC Barreto","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":28212,"logo_path":"/1qNlLT42Po3Adj1q4OLo0kUHnDy.png","name":"Imagem Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":55110,"logo_path":"/8S3cr5oE58Tmvwdxkz4Lhh2vs37.png","name":"Globosat","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two iconic women.
