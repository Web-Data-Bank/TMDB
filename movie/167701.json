The sessions and locations were influenced by gangs, Hollywood, and Los Angeles culture. It wasn’t much of a stretch because skate crews can be very gang-like to begin with. The Deathwish dudes are a tight-knit crew. Overall, I don’t think this is too far from what these guys are actually like. It’s really close to the truth.
