She must help a mortal nerd attain his “manhood,” or she will be doomed to a thousand years as the sorcerer’s slave.  All without the help of her magic!  What happens next is a hilarious romp through Oak Valley Junior College, as “Jeannie” enlists the help of three beautiful cheerleaders, and battles a trio of nasty jocks, to break the curse before the clock runs out.  “Jeannie’s” journey takes her through astronomy class, cheerleading try-outs, and a provocative lingerie party.
