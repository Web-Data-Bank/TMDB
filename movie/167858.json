A kindly, wise philosopher-type by the name of Orlando joins Marta in her search, and together they survive a gigantic sleeping dragon and imprisonment in a tower with no clear means of escape. They overcome that hurdle, but later on, Orlando succumbs to the evils of The Plague (an all-consuming woman!) and Marta continues on her search alone. Eventually, she does find her brother -- but that only introduces problems she had never considered.","popularity":2.285,"poster_path":"/49uYjKwgW9sQ1jrOXL2eWPErAUN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1931,"logo_path":"/5erHhgvym2cTORao8ajtn2gbiTH.png","name":"Filmové studio Barrandov","origin_country":"XC"},{"id":7168,"logo_path":null,"name":"România Film","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1983-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of the Voyages","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":16}
