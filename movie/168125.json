St. Peter introduces him to the heavenly house rules: “rejoicing” and “singing hallelujah”. Of that, “Angel Aloisus” is not very edified, especially since he is supposed to get “heavenly manna” instead of Munich beer. Due to a few irksome events at the side, his dissatisfaction is only increased. Angrily, he sits down on his cloud in order to rejoice and sing hallelujah. But that sounds in such a way that the heavenly population’s hair stood on end. In his indignation, Alois even doesn’t mince his words towards the Lord. The latter gives in and orders Alois to deliver the divine afflatus to the Bavarian government. He sends him immediately with a corresponding letter to Munich. As “angel Aloisius” comes back home, he at once goes to the Hofbräuhaus. And like this, the Bavarian government waits till today for the divine afflatus in vain.","popularity":0.607,"poster_path":"/g4mYHtu9zw57Jkv0cPAjj6mSySW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein Münchner im Himmel","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5}
