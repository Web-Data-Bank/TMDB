Embroiled in a torrid affair with a buxom neighbor, Sayed pays his best friend Ringo to keep the neighbor's barber husband busy -- but the husband, as well as Ringo, Sayed's mother, father, sister and grandfather, have their own amorous intrigues brewing. Director Oussama Fawzi has been hailed as the brightest young director to have recently emerged in Egyptian cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7ulIWmMmmwhfPBh9SSUT9oGYHcx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142661,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aflam Guirguiss Fawzy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"1996-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Asphalt Kings","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
