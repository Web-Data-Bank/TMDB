An \"active health insurance\", in which the insured directly take over everything including medical activities and thus save costs. A new currency that expires in a few weeks and therefore stimulates spending. Unemployed people who, as \"loan siblings\", are given a new job and a good life. The traffic therapy group that wants to make you understand the snake as a \"unitary organism\". A therapy office in the fresh air, which finally gives musty psychotherapy a healthy freedom. Color the world back into balance, at least in the parking lot. Or use humans as a self-sufficient source of energy. Or a tangibly equal democracy: All people attain the same eye level, an optimal 1.9m [via platform shoes].","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/oWSYwBAMwtX7bmHuCakamAFA2Qe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Measures to Better the World","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
