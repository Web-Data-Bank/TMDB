She's an actress for a soft-core filmmaker and soon is the most popular courtesan in Paris, parlaying this into a house, bought for her by a wealthy banker. She tosses him and takes up with her neighbor, a count of impeccable rectitude, and with the count's impressionable son. The count is soon fetching sticks like a dog and mortgaging his lands to satisfy her whims.","popularity":3.537,"poster_path":"/8KZ9ryjH0DEvqbXQqWiwgPiiTig.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1444,"logo_path":"/1848gsFuV3EGewKg8xWADAyJUVy.png","name":"Cannon Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golan-Globus Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1983-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The True Key of Pleasure","title":"Nana","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":18}
