Bielecki discourages his friend Jerzy Gorski (Artur Socha) by telling him his new work is rather poor, driving him into despair. But Bielecki is such a good friend that he even provides Gorski with the morphine so he can overdose too. With Gorski out of the way, Bielecki can now peddle his friend's book as his own. However, it doesn't take long for Bielecki's evil ways to catch up to him.","popularity":1.972,"poster_path":"/ovZ4HFI0dOPEuEkvrYssQIFtV6D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gloria","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1929-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Strong Man","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":12}
