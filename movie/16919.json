The film follows metal fan and anthropologist Sam Dunn on a whirlwind journey through Asia, South America and the Middle East as he explores the underbelly of the world's emerging extreme music scenes; from Indonesian death metal to Chinese black metal to Iranian thrash metal. GLOBAL METAL reveals a worldwide community of metalheads who aren't just absorbing metal from the West - they're transforming it - creating a new form of cultural expression in societies dominated by conflict, corruption and mass-consumerism.","popularity":3.703,"poster_path":"/28f1iaERjW8pk39Ye5KpG7Xfqa4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banger Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Global Metal","video":false,"vote_average":7.449,"vote_count":59}
