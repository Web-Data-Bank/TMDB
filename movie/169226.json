In their school days, Chun-sam was always the ambitious class president, while Dae-gyu had to settle for a role as vice president. Twenty years later their roles are reversed: Chun-sam is now a humble farmer who has assumed the post of village chief in his hometown, while Dae-gyu is the newly elected county magistrate. At first, Chun-sam asks his old friend for favours regarding the development of his village, but these requests are turned down. Later, when Dae-gyu proposes building a nuclear waste disposal facility in the county, Chun-sam leads demonstrations against the plan, turning old friends into bitter rivals.","popularity":2.317,"poster_path":"/zTFd72VCQmFyYExc9WAzbfcuipe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3657,"logo_path":"/2YXnZa6yPjxdHKzBLgmf57D8QpM.png","name":"Sidus","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":7036,"logo_path":"/javbyY0ZCvlFJtly3tpZqf2NwLX.png","name":"CJ Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2007-03-28","revenue":8095062,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Town Rivals","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":5}
