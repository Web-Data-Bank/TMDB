The film was one of the first exponents of the mobile camera-rock track-optical effect school of filmmaking, and it is much a document as it is a documentary. A repellent and fascinating depiction of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, along with Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco and the East Village in New York. Tiny Tim amounts to something resembling a recurring motif and narrator.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/xnNlLbev56YqKVgf9Sk0b47eUrd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Natoma","origin_country":""},{"id":80984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cerberus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Are What You Eat","video":false,"vote_average":1.9,"vote_count":5}
