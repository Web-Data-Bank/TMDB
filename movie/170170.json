The decline has occurred amid a collapse of moral values and the victory of “Mala Italia” over “Buona Italia”. It has been lauded as being ground-breaking in its creative combination of animation, interviews and hard facts, and has caused fierce controversy in Italy.","popularity":2.556,"poster_path":"/nK8QagC0FmDWT0FzztLSIsYQH9g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13284,"logo_path":null,"name":"Springshot Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A campaign to wake Italy up","title":"Girlfriend in a Coma","video":false,"vote_average":6.816,"vote_count":19}
