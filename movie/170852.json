In the ads he announced that he was planning to blow up and mount the best of those movies into a feature documentary to be released in German cinemas. He was surprised how many home movies he received and how generously people allowed him to use them for his feature. Part 1 of \"Deutschland privat\" gives us typical German home movies of the 1970s, i.e. private holidays, family parties, etc. Part 2 consists of what is now called \"amateur porn\"; home made 8mm movies featuring real porn action.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mt6FAiOombnusXBjvHxdHu775aL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert van Ackeren Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1979-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eine Anthologie des Volksfilms","title":"Germany Private 1 - Ethnologist of a People","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5}
