Her husband, Ramón, wants more of her attention; her feelings are mixed, wanting domestic peace, feeling responsibilities to the revolution, and wanting to control her own life beyond doing dirty dishes. They separate; he begins an affair. When he wants a reconciliation, she asks what his response would be if she'd had an affair too. \"But men are different,\" is his reply. He's failed her test, and to hold on to independence and self-respect, she remains uncompromising and hard-edged.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hGbFBuC1U1mHhpMn1tSxqB347SU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"1979-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Teresa","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":6}
