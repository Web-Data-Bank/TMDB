The unapologetically sentimental classic was directed by Wilhelm Dieterle, who launched a successful career in Weimar cinema before becoming known for romantic, lush melodramas and technicolor extravaganzas, including 1945′s Marlene Dietrich unforgettable Love Letters. The dashing Dieterle himself plays Harrogate, Earl of Torstein, whose star-crossed love for the luminous Rosemarie of Brauneck (Lien Deyers, discovered by Fritz Lang) is further doomed by royal heroes and villains, the requisite evil stepmother, and fantastical elements that channel the intoxicating romance of Camille through the magic of the Brothers Grimm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x353Ake73IB0MFSHqvb0v3nns0S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Film-Union AG (Defu) (Berlin)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1928-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Saint and Her Fool","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
