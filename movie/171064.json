An individual’s story is told in all its absolute concreteness, the friends he meets, the snack bar he goes to for a bite, the roll of scotch tape he picks up on the street; whereas a multitude’s story is told in all its epic tragedy, the night under the rain, the colossal preparation against the march, the advance behind shields, the attack of which the multitude was victim, the defense that gets organized.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xCEDN0BD6b8ZBd9NmS0kA5xlcfF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mauro Berardi per Luna Rossa Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2002-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carlo Giuliani, a Boy","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
