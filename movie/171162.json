Her legal guardian, a lecherous old man who has the hots for her, hires a private detective to spy on her. He tails her to a train headed for New Orleans, but she catches on to him. She befriends a young woman aboard the train and they both give the private eye the slip. What Diane doesn't know, however, is that that her newfound friend is actually a notorious criminal known as The Moth, and she has her own reasons for helping Diane escape--she, too, is being tailed by a detective, who's after a cache of jewels she's stolen.","popularity":0.676,"poster_path":"/hn4OtpGHfHTMKZRvCT0vgPqiA8N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showmen's Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":36237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screencraft Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
