She can magically transform ordinary objects when she sneezes. She has even brought the dead back to life. We know about her, because she sneezed a movie camera into existence, and the film was (miraculously, of course) preserved in the Egyptian desert. However, she didn't live so long ago that she wasn't hounded by life insurance salesmen, just like everyone else in the modern era. Rather than being outcaste for her abilities, she is valued by a group of science-oriented men, who also manage to record on a sneezed-into-existence phonograph the sound which is later to be added to the film by its \"discoverers.\"","popularity":0.822,"poster_path":"/jKjTQPsxUNfuxP7a36VB63dsEUI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1990-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Liberté d'une statue","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
