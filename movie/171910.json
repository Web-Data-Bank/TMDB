Spitting in the face of the status quos of body image, gender identity, sexuality, and preconceived notions of beauty, Divine succeeded in becoming an internationally recognized icon, recording artist, and character actor of stage and screen. Glenn went from the often-mocked, schoolyard fat kid to underdog royalty, standing up for millions of gay men and women, drag queens and punk rockers, and countless other socially ostracized misfits and freaks. With a completely committed in-your-face style, he blurred the line between performer and personality, and revolutionized pop culture.","popularity":4.403,"poster_path":"/dVu4I4UPVJOY8LuW6fPojgSQUpL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11339,"logo_path":"/tvjthQph7f39rDOoJRolP0wJvhg.png","name":"Automat Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13097,"logo_path":null,"name":"Making it Big","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-09","revenue":115739,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of the most beautiful woman in the world","title":"I Am Divine","video":false,"vote_average":7.61,"vote_count":78}
