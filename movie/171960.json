In many ways, this recent film is a departure of Benningâ€™s earlier films which are characterized, at times, by extremely long, carefully planned takes and a minimal narrative approach. In NORTH ON EVERS, the shots are kept short with a narrative that is direct and detailed, like a diary or a long series of postcards to a friend. What this work shares with the other films is a dry wit and a deep interest in the American social landscape.","popularity":0.652,"poster_path":"/AmHK2TiEGQXRk9BP3JxcgqAyaOa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North on Evers","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":8}
