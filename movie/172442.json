It examines the evolution of the World of Warcraft from its infancy to its non-existent conclusion and beyond, into the world of obsession.  Through the lives of several key characters, it shows the joys associated with online games, and offers a objective look at some of its inherent trappings.  /afk seeks to create a dialog about gamers in an attempt to bring understanding to the online gaming phenomenon and the millions of gamers behind the World of Warcraft; the most successful MMO of all time.  In doing so, one might assert that gaming can no sooner be understood than that of any other form of addiction: if it's an addiction at all.","popularity":1.04,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"/afk: Away from Keyboard","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
