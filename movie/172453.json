They're called virtual worlds and are 3D computer generated universes where you sign up, choose a body, build a house and you're ready to live out your Second Life. In online virtual worlds, like Second Life, everyone is beautiful or exotic. You can chat up strangers, slay mythical dragons or create your fantasy business and even make real money.
