And being just what the department needed (someone who looks and acts completely unlike a spy), she's assigned to simple courier duty to pick up a book in Mexico City.

And it's up to her to get them out.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/2AbBnCxF6pyZex5XPcQEUWTBuAJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60,"logo_path":"/1SEj4nyG3JPBSKBbFhtdcHRaIF9.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"},{"id":132744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Meteor Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Before she joined the CIA, Mrs. Pollifax thought Red China was a set of dishes.","title":"Mrs. Pollifax — Spy","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
