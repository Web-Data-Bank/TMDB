There were 8000 people in attendance and the show drew a 4.5 rating on TBS. This show set up Starrcade '88: True Gritt. It was on this show that TBS/NWA experimented with a top down camera angle, which did not catch on. This is comparable to the \"refer-eye\" camera from Halloween Havoc '91. This is the very first supershow held by World Championship Wrestling.","popularity":1.172,"poster_path":"/erakIBCVi6GIdbEBHzgN49VDtiE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13510,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Championship Wrestling (WCW)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WCW Clash of The Champions IV: Season's Beatings","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
