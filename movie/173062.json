One out of every ten households in American owns a Sony Playstation. Children who own video game equipment play an average of ten hours per week. And yet, despite capturing the attention of millions of children worldwide, video games remain one of the least scrutinized cultural industries.  Game Over is the first educational documentary to address the fastest growing segment of the media through engaging questions of gender, race and violence.
