A nameless man sits in an unfamiliar bathroom, his bloodied hands trembling as he ponders his crime of passion. An amnesiac without an identity, he goes in search of himself, only to unearth a long-buried family secret surrounding the bizarre deaths of his parents. An abstract ghost story populated by ever-threatening specters, shadowy souls with evil motives who inhabit a nightmare world within a troubled killer's psyche. They might offer a smile or a kind word, but their only purpose is to snare others into their Hell. Before the killer can come to terms with his deeds and escape this esoteric prison, he must confront his dead parents and make good on an infant's promise made thirty years ago.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/5ZRExV9zhX9OIv9vAw7VhgCqr3O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Family, are they really gone?
