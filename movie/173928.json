Two writers, Eça de Queiroz and Ramalho Ortigão, decide to write a four-handed whodunit for the daily \"Diário de Notícias\". Could it be that the story they wrote as fiction is based on a real case?

Everything happens at frenzied pace, as in a game.","popularity":0.832,"poster_path":"/3zbXphRRh3VBtoskMzRwYRQtbEU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animatógrafo II","origin_country":""},{"id":4290,"logo_path":"/ocUWrkAx1627h3WeUENn17dAgOs.png","name":"Moonshot Pictures","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":16418,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instituto do Cinema, Audiovisual e Multimédia (ICAM)","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":11547,"logo_path":"/kyOeH5CwsaILcJItafIMAM4KElB.png","name":"Agência Nacional do Cinema - ANCINE","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2007-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A critique of the romantic Portuguese society of the nineteenth century.","title":"The Mystery of Sintra","video":false,"vote_average":5.25,"vote_count":8}
