A \"respectable\" couple of city \"card sharpers\" invite a distant country relative to visit, then use her as a pretty, unwitting decoy to lure rich victims. They flee town a step ahead of the law. At a resort, the innocent girl falls in love with the latest victim, but they help expose and apprehend the guilty parties.","popularity":0.636,"poster_path":"/5K2bBIRhI2B6DfQhqYV8d11oXjR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Decoy","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
