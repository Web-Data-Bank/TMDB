Leaving their matchbox, they line the film in circular, concentric movements.  In an almost aquatic momentum, the squadron of little bits of wood mould the contours of a character, a run-of-the-mill smoker, before transforming into a funny harness.  The film ends when the matches, again transformed, take on the appearance of a distinguished man who, after several attempts, finally finds a way of lighting his cigarette.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Générale des Cinématographes Éclipse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1914-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fancy Matches","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
