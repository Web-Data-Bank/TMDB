This film takes us through the exposition: from the Cabrillo bridge and a panoramic view of the site, to the facades of the California Building, Horticultural Building, Panama Canal Exhibit, and the reproduction of the locks at Gatuna. We see tourists on the isthmus and a crowd outside the Panama Film Company's exhibit of how movies are made. We watch the feeding of fish at the laguna, and we end at the Plaza de Panama where toddlers are surrounded by pigeons. Fatty Arbuckle makes a brief appearance outside the Panama Film exhibit. Titles give us each structure's cost.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/yOAPmQV93MjlG5hXC91uzDmqXog.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Glimpse of the San Diego Exposition","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
