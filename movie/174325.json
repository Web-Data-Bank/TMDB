Once billed as \"The Funniest Woman in the World,\" Mabley pushed the boundaries of comedy by tackling topics such as gender, sex, and racism and performed up until her death in 1975. A true passion project for first-time director Whoopi Goldberg, the documentary shows Mabley's historical significance and profound influence as a performer vastly ahead of her time.","popularity":1.885,"poster_path":"/hR6rugHHYlwJvLzCyqvh97CDkK6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81273,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whoop/One Ho Productions/Lil' Whoop Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Original Queen of Comedy","title":"Moms Mabley","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":9}
