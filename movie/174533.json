Out of the blue, Lloyd decides he's going to join the navy and you really wonder if part of the film leading to it is missing. After all, the decision seemed to come from no where and why Snub Pollard would also join is unclear. And, oddly, they seem to skip all training and are stationed on a navy ship. Soon Pollard's wife comes to the boat looking for him and she's put off the boat as the movie ends very, very anticlimactically.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8F3XUBHzkJSLoTPfZcrjBmIXrLS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rolin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luke Joins the Navy","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
