But less sophisticated: The Roman Emperor Mulius Caesar borrows more money than he should. The loan shark is all over him and exploits this to get near the emperor's daughter. A slave falls in love with the daughter and sends the loan shark in a rage â€“ unless the slave is sent to Colosseum he will foreclose the emperor's mortgage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Conquest Pictures Company","origin_country":""},{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friends, Romans and Leo","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":2}
