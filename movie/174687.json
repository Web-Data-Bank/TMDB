Many wild things occur to him in the cartoons and they are meant to be silly entertainment. Here, he gets into a fight with a kangaroo.

And, as a result, there is a funny lingering after-effect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1IzXQuYuoAlEJwreviTcNN8ul8d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colonel Heeza Liar on the Jump","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
