He is a clumsy guy working in a restaurant and oddly, everyone who works in the place as well as many of the customers are Kaiser-loving spies. Why they would be headquartered in a restaurant in California, I have no idea! Regardless, their aim is to steal some plans from some old guy and his daughter. When Semon finds out, he comes to the rescue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x96eFT890SdBtp0APYTukyw9y68.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Huns and Hyphens","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":5}
