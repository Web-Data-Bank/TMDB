Can cannabis cause schizophrenia? Is it addictive? Can it lead you on to harder drugs? Or is it simply a herb, an undervalued medicine?  Addiction specialist Dr John Marsden discovers that modern science is finally beginning to find answers to these questions. John traces the cannabis plants' birthplace in Kazakhstan; finds the origins of our sensitivity to cannabis in the simple sea squirt; and shows just what it does to our brains.  He meets people who have been changed by this drug in drastically different ways - from those whose lives have been shattered to those who lives have been revived.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/noQEl0zjbav9w1PvQZFGEOwNqYy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cannabis: The Evil Weed?","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":3}
