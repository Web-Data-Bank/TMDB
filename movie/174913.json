He's retrieved a letter she dropped and wants to return it to her, but it's pretty clear that his interest extends beyond mere politeness. (She's the adorable young Bebe Daniels, so this is easy to understand.) The movie studio setting provides Harold with lots of opportunities to do what comedians do in comedies like this one: flirt with actresses, anger the studio brass, and dash through sets disrupting everything.","popularity":0.771,"poster_path":"/xORrmdEAPA8xsgyEzFkR17lflQO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rolin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hey There","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6}
