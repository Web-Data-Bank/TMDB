A story of a Jewish girl forced to hide her identity in order to attend medical school in St. Petersburg, the movie is a melodrama of multiple oppression. Lea, as played by Negri, is at a disadvantage as a woman, an orphan and a Jew -- and yet has immense persistence and an insatiable ambition of becoming a doctor. The film includes more than one plot twist (the final one further complicating the issue of Lea's identity), but it's first and foremost a testimony to a spirit impossible to suppress.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/5uYzqspXz0VFlMWGyIU7DuWGSfc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions-AG Union (PAGU)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1918-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Yellow Ticket","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
