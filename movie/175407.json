Meanwhile, across the studio, Max is animating Koko. When he's called over to consult on the too-accurate bust, Koko gets mischievous and creates his own drawings. He then escapes and crawls inside the clay bust, eventually wriggling off like an inchworm. He gets into a fight with the man being modelled, both of them flinging wads of clay.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rJe6LUlqz3jfV6HugfTBr71PtQ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Out of the Inkwell Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modeling","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":11}
