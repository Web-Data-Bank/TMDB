The plot finds echoes throughout the Weimar period, including Sternberg’s The Blue Angel. Conrad Veidt appears in a supporting role as a sinister blind painter, whose entrance eerily presages Murnau’s Nosferatu. Der Gang in die Nacht, the earliest surviving film by F. W. Murnau, is also, paradoxically, the only Murnau film for which the original camera negative exists.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":"/p8YTVpLBJsJAUro6f42gvxig8Um.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goron Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1921-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey Into the Night","video":false,"vote_average":5.824,"vote_count":17}
