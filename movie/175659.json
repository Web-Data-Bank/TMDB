The leader of the sweethearts is Mizuki (Kaori Kobayashi), who loses whatever traces of sense she might have possessed when her teacher turns up knocked up! The girls form a “miscarriage club” to kill the unborn baby in order to show the insolent adult who calls the shots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/adfKr1pWbihTO3UiYo9ei11GD3r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Make the Teacher Have a Miscarriage Club","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5}
