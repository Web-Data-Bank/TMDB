In a simple, but powerful way Czekala presents a horror that happened in concentration camps – prisoners’ dread, humiliation and lost humanity. The everyday roll-call ends tragically because of prisoners’ “insubordination” in this black and white film. The Roll-Call crossed borders of what can be presented or not in animation. It is sometimes interpreted as a response to the trend of allegorical and philosophical films that dominated in Polish animation in 1960s.","popularity":0.749,"poster_path":"/bTQiuczOUkRDE3m5vBdBmznWFra.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Miniatur Filmowych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1971-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Appeal","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":20}
