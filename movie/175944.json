It's been in existence for over 100 years, although it's not on any known map. It's a nice place to visit, with lovely shops and friendly people. That is unless you are single, young, healthy and good looking! It's even worse if you are a female of childbearing age. The town has a very lucrative underground and Internet business specializing in selling human organs for transplant, selling babies to loving couples who are barren and auctioning young women into sex slavery.","popularity":1.461,"poster_path":"/zjoK1kyHYhKaAjIbhf5NVnfwUoy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orrichio Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to die there","title":"Abduction","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":8}
