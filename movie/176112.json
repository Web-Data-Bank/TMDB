While most of the attributes from 1995's Riverdance: The Show remain--the dazzling ensemble choreography, Bill Whelan's energetic score, and the New Age-y view of Celtic mythology--the most significant difference is at the top, where Colin Dunne replaced bombastic lead dancer Michael Flatley. Though lacking Flatley's bravura, Dunne is a superb technician who works well with Flatley's former co-lead, Jean Butler. Flamenco dancer Maria Pagis returns, as do the Riverdance Singers (formerly known as Anuna) with soloist Katie McMahon and the orchestra with fiery fiddler Eileen Ivers.","popularity":4.402,"poster_path":"/rcxc2lsEqNBpHmOYUo9dfjIYJ5z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riverdance: Live from Radio City Music Hall","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
