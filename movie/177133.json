When he manages to free himself, he finds a mobile phone, a light stick and a strange black stone. A number is tattooed on the inside of his wrist. From the way the container shakes can be deduced that Chiba is transported first in a truck and then on a ship. And he’s not the only one. People are trapped in the containers next to him as well, about a hundred in total.
