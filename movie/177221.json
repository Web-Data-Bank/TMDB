They are forced to form a battery: a catcher and a pitcher who work together to outwit the batter, the one who hits the ball. And the batter in this case just happens to be a zombie. Tough Ben and gentle Mickey frequently disagree on the best way to go about the situation. Then they suddenly hear a human voice through their walkie-talkies. Is salvation nearby, like Mickey thinks, or is Benâ€™s suspicion justified?","popularity":6.263,"poster_path":"/n7xjDQVdFQr6vNIN4kjKSPZYiMo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22633,"logo_path":null,"name":"O.
