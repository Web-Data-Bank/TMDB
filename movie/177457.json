Despite a defiant never look back philosophy, Miles was persuaded by Quincy Jones and Claude Nobs to take part in this tribute to his great friend Gil Evans, who had passed away in 1988. This truly unique concert was an historical event and a musical triumph, thankfully captured here for posterity. Miles Davis was a giant of 20th century music and this concert is as much a tribute to him as it is to the late Gil Evans.","popularity":0.958,"poster_path":"/2dqralEH1FVx31dFvx3V6eS03Li.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11701,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montreux Jazz Festival","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":214,"logo_path":"/qIptM4dZBNflgv2OXzYECv8iQNH.png","name":"Eagle Vision","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":20005,"logo_path":null,"name":"DoRo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miles Davis with Quincy Jones and the Gil Evans Orchestra: Live at Montreux 1991","video":true,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":2}
