A cortege of Arabs, about 20 persons in the party, walk past; the dignitaries are in front, attended by men with horns and drums. Coming in the other direction are local Swiss, who pay little attention, and a group of native-garbed Africans. The dozen or so well-dressed denizens of Geneva who are sitting on the steps of the Divan take it all in.","popularity":0.898,"poster_path":"/fQQlJRfjwbEBEDqaKA3ko492BOR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumière","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1896-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arab Cortege, Geneva","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":10}
