The wall looks to be about 20 feet above sea level and extend at least 100 feet into the water. A large wave rolls picturesquely along the wall toward the shore. Smaller waves follow. Then the scene changes to river water flowing. We see both shores: in the foreground a log and tree branch are visible; on the far shore, there appears to be a low wall with trees beyond it. The camera is stationary in both shots.","popularity":1.211,"poster_path":"/baCUxmBltzTcIfqRK1R7fXMg4Jt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Birt Acres","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1895-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rough Sea at Dover","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":32}
