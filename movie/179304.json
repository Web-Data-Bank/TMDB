This is a richly enjoyable exploration of the life of a born performer with some great archive footage and rare photographs. A highly successful career on the London stage was put on hold when Bette discovered gay liberation. But out of a gay drag commune in Notting Hill, Bette fashioned a glorious theatre troupe Bloolips, bringing together a unique blend of costume, camp and musical theatre leavened with sexual politics. The film offers an insight into a passionate and gifted actor who has made a great contribution to gay life, art and politics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/80ek7cMq2a0791A0pjsiGGbgqND.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bette Bourne: It Goes with the Shoes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
