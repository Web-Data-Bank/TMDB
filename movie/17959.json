Not only do the market and his career look like a Trabant from before the fall of the Berlin Wall, but he has a wife who is thriving in success; a family whose habits are driving him insane; clients with bad taste and too much money. Not to mention 14-year-old baristas who think they know the difference between highland coffee beans, picked by virgins at midnight and the coffee from the local supermarket. So there's a lot getting on his nerves, so much so, that one day, when things become real serious, he can only weather the storm in his own repelling way.","popularity":1.406,"poster_path":"/q3ewZN6KQFIkuKC6mfngCacEpjE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":155,"logo_path":"/cDY49SOQwJixJSMun9Haerx8dAQ.png","name":"Nimbus Film","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":6690,"logo_path":"/gilqi5hbNH7y9UlWg1P0TjAqZa8.png","name":"Sandrew Metronome Danmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2009-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Balls","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":24}
