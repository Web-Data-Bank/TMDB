The band was magnificent, the hits came like pearls on a string, both the audience and critics cheered - and now it is possible to experience the party night at home in their own living room.  Kaizers Orchestra - Live At Oslo Spektrum contains a large number of hits and favorites from one of Norway's largest rock bands by far, with songs that span the entire band's career. Here is everything from the EP debut \"Prayer from Hell\" to the singles from the fifth album Violeta Violeta Volume I, performed on an atmospheric stage full of pump organs, oil drums, chandeliers and red velvet. And, as I said, a band that bursts with energy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gqVW66k69Vdxp6ChzR1aaQ3nB6H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5458,"logo_path":"/rz6dc1VDwCM1KvlJj4L9gTytoiq.png","name":"Sony BMG Music Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2011-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaizers Orchestra - Live i Oslo Spektrum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
