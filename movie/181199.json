A few ominous omens try to avert him from his decision, like a bloodstain on the floor or his tongue turning black, but Damien pays little attention. He arranges a sojourn at one of Father Pierre’s centers. When he arrives, he’s greeted by the three employees of the center, a trinity as silent as disturbing who slurp from their soup as voraciously as Hannibal Lecter from a dish of lamb brains. Just like Alice In Wonderland, our reporter finds himself in a surreal universe. Every door he opens, will confront him with his own demons : his cowardice, his incapacity to decide anything and his continuous flight from responsibility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abracadabra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
