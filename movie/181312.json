The \"Golden\" 50s run in a serene potpourri of weekly clips, old cinema, and party advertising, demonstrate the attempts of the revived industry to change consumer habits.

All this in the nostalgia touch of a time when nylons triumphed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u1WhGwl9Equ74uLVuaNChAAfTSs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Starmedia Home Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1987-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rendezvous unterm Nierentisch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
