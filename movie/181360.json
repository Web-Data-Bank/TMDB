Osen, a middle-aged maid from a nearby inn, takes her in and nurses her, assisted by Dr. Minami, a young physician who diagnoses her illness as a mild case of pneumonia. With Masako in good hands and needing a few days to recuperate, her classmates continue their tour. Masako’s recovery, however, is hampered by her spoiled and immature nature and her determination to punish the world for the loss of her mother.","popularity":0.717,"poster_path":"/ghiwDFbsFGcImu6pz89KOgCv9Ue.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3094,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shintoho Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1951-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dispersed Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
