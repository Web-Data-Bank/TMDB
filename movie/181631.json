[The plot revolves around a public contribution campaign to buy airplanes.] The mayor's aviator son promises to fly over the village in salute, and much of the narrative concerns the preparations for this great event. Tasaka throws in a few songs, some village humor and satire, and tremendous camera mobility, finally wringing every possible effect from his climax.\" John Gillett, British Film Institute","popularity":0.668,"poster_path":"/A4qM7dOuZDutVvCaE7pZkAuL5sc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75364,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nikkatsu Studio","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1939-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Explosion!","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
