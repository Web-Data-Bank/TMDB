Witness Babe Ruth at bat; Lou Gehrig's \"\"luckiest man\"\" speech; Roger Maris breaking the Babe's home-run record; Pete Gray, the St. Louis Brown's one-armed outfielder; Ted William's final at-bat when he went out in grand style, ending his career with a home run, and other classic moments in baseball history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The \"Boys of Summer\" from the Games' Golden Age","title":"Reel Baseball - Baseball's Golden Era the Way Americans Witnessed It","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
