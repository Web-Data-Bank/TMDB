Actually what they are looking for is a permanent employment rather than non-stop gun action, extortion and dealing. Daddone, on the other side, is totally frustrated with the outcome of his criminal career and dreams of a coup that would make him the godfather of the gangs in town. Unfortunately, no one takes him seriously, least of all his own wife who treats him like a cheap small time hustler and she always sends him on errands.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wizZ0ZsRSx7vnh3xqVZG8YWcgSW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maxima Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":163916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Easycinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sodoma - The Dark Side of Gomorrah","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
