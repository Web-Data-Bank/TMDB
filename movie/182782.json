She always sang the truth, sometimes bitter, sometimes funny, sometimes cruel. She was feared, despised and coveted. Taarka sang throughout her remarkable life, throughout her fate, from a small Seto village to international fame. And she sang well. Really well. Taarka became the Mother of the Song, a legend. But as a woman, as a member of the community, the Seto people never really accepted her. Taarka - a despised woman and a worshiped singer.","popularity":0.74,"poster_path":"/6wZMSgLee7w4JZHbpem2t6p9sQr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6163,"logo_path":"/AlWeXHCWoJMx4HoZiOJ4GNjJ6qz.png","name":"Exitfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2008-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taarka","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
