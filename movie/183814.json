She ultimately lost the award to Dilba, and didn't take it very well. The day after, the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet published a story about Leila K peeing on the floor at the award ceremony. Leila K filed a lawsuit against them, and was offered a chance to redeem herself. The documentary also covers how Leila K built her career and stardom, from the beginning with Rob'n'Raz and their world wide mega hit \"Got To Get\" in 1989, up to her second album of her solo career.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/obcHfryVBGFl4t4CAV7DJMxrdfy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Story Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1998-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fuck You, Fuck You Very Much","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
