They talk about their first sexual experiences, the gay scene in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the pall cast by AIDS, the safe-sex movement, getting into serious relationships, the illness and death of partners, pornography, S/M and pain, race and stereotypes, personal fantasies, and bliss. Huestis has a thesis, that sex is going to be with us, so how best do we embrace it? His 15 subjects, archival footage, clips from porn films, and close-up looks at men loving men flesh out various answers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex Is...","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
