After robbing Jules Tulane’s (John Dehner, The Boys from Brazil) estate of his crop, Scarlet takes over Tulane’s land debt and forces him to pay or go to prison. In exchange for postponing his debt, Scarlet allows Tulane’s son, André (Lex Barker, Robin Hood and the Pirates), to work as her servant. When André and Scarlet fall in love, it leads to jealous rage from Scarlet’s former paramour, expert swordsman Hugo (Warren Stevens, Forbidden Planet) — and when Hugo looks to raid the Tulane estate again, it is up to André and Scarlet to take him down and save the estate.","popularity":2.534,"poster_path":"/bp1s7Ew0UJMH3myXX5tncclmmUP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sam Katzman Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Roaring Story of the Notorious Lili Scarlet -- Gambling Queen of the Mississippi!","title":"Duel on the Mississippi","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
