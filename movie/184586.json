They're hindered by a snowstorm, but make it none the worse for wear, warming themselves by a fire they help stoke. They play and sing some songs, and then a chaotic dinner ensues. This is followed by more singing and dancing, and a good time is had by all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parrotville Old Folks","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
