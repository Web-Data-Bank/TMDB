The building site is like a theatre in which the former inhabitants, the neighbours, the workers, the builder and the new owner all appear. Israeli television censured the film.  \"Gitai wants this house to be both a symbol and something very concrete; he wants it to become a character in a film. He achieves one of the most beautiful things a camera can register 'live', as it were; people who look at the same thing but see different things - and who are moved by that vision. In this crumbling shell of a house, real hallucinations begin to take shape. The film's central idea is simple and the film has simply the force of that idea, no more, no less.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cf4LS1zrX8aed54LaJ7XGGQ08M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bait / House / La maison (La casa)","title":"House","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4}
