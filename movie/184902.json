Meanwhile, the dark warrior Savage Opress returns to his creator, the witch Mother Talzin, who gives him a sinister mission: to search the galaxy for his brother, Sith Apprentice Darth Maul. Believed dead for over a decade after falling to the sword of then Jedi Apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul is nearly unrecognizable, residing in the bowels of a ruined planet and fueled by hatred. Savage Opress delivers the shattered Maul to Mother Talzin to restore his former powers, and the brothers vow an oath of vengeance against Obi-Wan Kenobi.","popularity":5.977,"poster_path":"/mOtQgGmdNxouIiMLIPUzIe94UbZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
