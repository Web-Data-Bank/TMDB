But the shortcomings of the new gangs mean that he is soon having to call on his old-school yakuza talents. And when he falls for Asako, a beautiful piano player, she unknowingly ignites a fire within Kuni that will immolate everything and everybody around him. Regarded by many as his masterpiece, Onibi has all the hallmarks of a Mochizuki film, with the gangster elements tightly compressed and controlled to allow space in which a subdued romance can bloom. Coming from a background in porno cinema, this master of sexual relations injects a fresh passion and tension into the macho world of the yakuza film.","popularity":1.318,"poster_path":"/aKPVWhRNPVzzzIRBdjvOjBvmG7F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3656,"logo_path":"/mY6L0bHRp8fNWfICPqLjxp3khvq.png","name":"GAGA Communications","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Onibi: The Fire Within","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":10}
