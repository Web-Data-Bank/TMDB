He was 10 years old when his family, members of the Beta Israel, a secluded 2500-year old community of observant Jews in northern Ethiopia, began their escape. Kidnapped from a refugee camp in Sudan, Avishai was eventually freed and transported to Israel as part of Operation Moses. As part of a racial minority in Israel, Avishai longed for a place where he wouldn’t be called “falasha” (outsider). Now a U.S. resident, Avishai draws on his experiences and launches an inquiry into other Jewish minority groups, leading him to other African, Asian and Latino Jews in Israel and the United States.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pkG1vBnh5XrFYUv119pNHzwEe1I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One family's Exodus - from Ethiopia to Israel","title":"400 Miles to Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
