With extraordinary access to devastated parents desperately searching for their stolen son; a man who brokers the deals and has sold his own offspring; and prospective parents grappling with giving up their soon-to-be-born daughter through lack of options, we are brought face to face with the crisis that such a stringent government policy has created among China's poorest people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"China's Stolen Children","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
