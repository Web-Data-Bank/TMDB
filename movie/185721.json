In this photo study, Ted talks about his store, the customers who have come and gone and the social changes his multicultural neighbourhood has seen. But most of all he wonders what will become of his store after he retires. He hopes his daughter will take over, but she wants to move away. The film is a wistful rendering of a shopkeeper's relationship with his daughter and a fascinating portrait of a neighbourhood and its inhabitants.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pZ9ycQPkPtJ8Cz9wo4OQTxcPvwB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1982-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ted Baryluk's Grocery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
