Inside, it is like a small city, with businesses and services abound. The prisoners make their living inside the enclosure as they would outside. There is a strong self-organization that plans every-body's lives. As if it weren't enough, there are hundreds of women, wives of the inmates, and almost 300 children, who chose to share their captivity. They are non-convicted beings that accepted living behind bars with the only purpose of preserving a united family. The documentary shows the life of a family inside the jail of La Paz.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iUfQoOAhrzU3IotVonQb1TQbvTC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"2012-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citadel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
