During his four decades career, he has been through many facets: from acoustic to electric guitar; from politicized to religious lyrics; from minimalist to very highly sophisticated arrangements. And his characteristic voice, for some, hoarse and full of style, for others a little out of tune, still influences many musicians. In this presentation filmed at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in Australia over February 24-25 1986, Dylan is accompanied by Tom Petty and the band The Heartbreakers, as well as a very fine selection of new compositions. To close the spectacle, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty perform a vocal duet in \"Knockin' on heaven's door\", one of the most famous songs of this compositor.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/1CpIGO2pBYylRDqUWbckirj9pHE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":127568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wolfboy Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hard to Handle: Bob Dylan in Concert","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
