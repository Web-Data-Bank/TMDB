Two decades later, Fujian is a microcosm of Chinese modernity: there are palatial suburbs populated by lonely \"remittance widows\"; neon-lit discotheques frequented by karaoke kids; coastal villages inhabited by impoverished fishermen and city centers dominated by gangs, snakeheads and language schools acting as fronts for organized human trafficking.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fDBwsuihp4tgQdqjRVGKBAcnTqD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2007-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fujian Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
