Only one thing is missing: the ship. According to legend, Vulchan, a 19th-century gypsy pirate, attacked three convoys laden with gold. He robbed them, sunk them and hid his treasure by the coast. Fast forward to present day. Captain Jack, an ex-con himself, leads a motley bunch of homeless outcasts—alcoholics and petty criminals—in a search for the hidden loot. But their hopes of riches and glory are threatened when the brother of the Bulgarian Prime Minister announces plans to build a new mega tourist resort by the Black Sea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jHK3TE4N6W7wvOm7HvRC3KofN9P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agitprop","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2013-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Black Sea Pirates","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":6}
