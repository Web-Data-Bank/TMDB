However, he doesn't let that stop him: he goes around impersonating an officer, investigating crimes and busting criminals. One day, he interrupts a bank robbery (by three men in drag), gets shot in the process and dies. When the case is assigned to a female investigator, he returns as a ghost to lend a hand at solving the robbery.","popularity":0.876,"poster_path":"/acDq8ZN48T6YUWgoSkf7jsdNVjb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72576,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Sun Light Production Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1989-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiritually a Cop","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
