Cho is a slacker who spends his day selling ice cream with his best friend/roommate Beer. Even though his ice cream truck business is failing, he still has a roof over his head because his apartment belongs to his uncle. When his cousin Tina decides to return to Hong Kong, Cho and Beer are forced to share their home with her, creating an antagonistic relationship between the three. However, Cho and Tina begin to bond over time, though they won't admit to having feelings for each other. When Tina's charismatic boss Machi enters the picture, Cho realizes that he may already be too late.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xCvJKw8LcEFweir4YWOKFenJsn0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2012-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love in Time","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
