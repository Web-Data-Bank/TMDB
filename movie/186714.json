Pablo is a typical teen, with a fondness for football and sneaking beers with his buddies. He enjoys a comfortable upper-middle class life with his mother (Assumpta Serna), a successful lawyer and former feminist rabble-rouser, but has a gaping hole at the core of his identity: he has no idea who his father is. Preoccupied with the question to the point of obsession, he sets out in search of answers, and finds himself on a trail that leads to the Canary Islands.","popularity":0.762,"poster_path":"/dZLZVyA067f1I03jjU6TdBJv232.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Los Films del Tango","origin_country":""},{"id":9335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ España","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":7868,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central de Producciones Audiovisuales S.L.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1996-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like a Bolt of Lightning","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
