Do the scholars side with the fox spirits, trying to achieve immortality or are they being bewitched by it? It leads to a wild ending with a battle between humans, fox spirits and ghosts that seems more like a Halloween costume showcase than anything else.","popularity":1.204,"poster_path":"/27GzLq7JTBHj5jKJFlxUppgH1Tc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1971-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come Haunt with Me","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
