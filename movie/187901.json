He created a hilarious and lovable comic persona that was both uniquely Asian but also universally beloved. This, his first film, not only showcased his incomparable sense of humor but revolutionized Hong Kong comedy. Evoking Chaplin, he plays a warlord in early 20th Century China, but makes the role his own with both laughs and some of the sexiest ladies on the Shaw Brothers lot.","popularity":3.315,"poster_path":"/zGDtUPC34d6cuw85XzonpqV0OQW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1972-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Warlord","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":4}
