Wilson is an FBI agent, George a mechanic, Phil teaches African-American studies, and Dre's a doctor. They tease and reminisce, mostly about sex; they argue, mostly about racial politics. Then, late on the second night of the trip, they stop at a roadside diner. Phil and a cracker get in a pushing match, and soon fists are flying. The four drive off, but their woes have just begun as they get lost on a county road and the deputy sheriffs get a call to watch for four drug dealers who tried to rob the diner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mzIRp6ITVOSeYx1oTbUmqokhnne.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back Road Diner","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":2}
