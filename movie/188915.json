THE LAST POGO documents the raucous 1978 punk concert held in Toronto's legendary Horseshoe Tavern-a night of unhinged music and unbridled mayhem. On December 1, 1978, legendary Toronto concert promoters Gary Topp and Gary Cormier-better known as The Garys-presented The Last Pogo, a rollicking, riotous concert at the venerable Horseshoe Tavern. On the bill were seminal bands from Toronto's punk rock scene: The Scenics, The Cardboard Brains, The Secrets, The Mods, The Ugly, The Viletones and Teenage Head. During the concert, the frenetic energy of 800+ thrashing fans in the club boiled over and a near-riot ensued. Filmmaker Colin Brunton was there with a camera crew to capture it all, from the irreverent punk musicians and the slam-dancing audience to the police who tried to stop the show and the firefighters called in to escort people from the premises.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xCqqr0cGNwcCg60Vx7mDpZI5eJN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Pogo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
