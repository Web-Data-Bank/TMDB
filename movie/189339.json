Their first release in 14 years, GREATEST HITS LIVE, doesn’t represent a new side to War, but that’s not why fans will pick up the disc. Instead, the large ensemble, famous for its mixing of rock, soul, Latin, and funk, recaptures the sunny, organic feel of its ‘70s albums with high-energy versions of “The World Is a Ghetto,” “Me and My Brother,” and “Why Can't We Be Friends.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qD0HfVb0obHtQTbD8kAHHOecJdM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War Greatest Hits Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
