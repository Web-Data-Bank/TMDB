While Pal discovers his newfound freedom, Arthur discovers how much he misses his dog. Good thing Arthur has the gang to turn to--especially his best friend, Buster Baxter who dusts off his old detective gear to get on the case. This canine quest leads Arthur and Buster across Elwood city, deep into the bowels of an ice cream factory, past a giant cow on ice skates, and right up to the point where all hope seems lost. Could the solution to this caper, though, be right in front of Arthur's eyes? And why has DW been acting funny so lately? One thing's for certain, Arthur is determined to get to the bottom of this case. Follow Arthur, Buster, and all their friends through the streets of Elwood City as they sniff out clues and chase after leads...and learn a valuable lesson about friendship, teamwork, and responsibility","popularity":3.288,"poster_path":"/p0UDF7ImnAVtmK7LQYetY6dIU0v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35,"logo_path":"/wxrHa3nZ1K4zo65p56991INkGo6.png","name":"Lions Gate Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5024,"logo_path":"/9CkYR0swSEj5iVi9bzx9erLnmzm.png","name":"Mainframe Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":80857,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marc Brown Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":80858,"logo_path":null,"name":"RichCrest Animation","origin_country":""},{"id":80859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kidtoon Films","origin_country":""},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Arthur Stars in His First Movie!","title":"Arthur's Missing Pal","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
