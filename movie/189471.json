This is one of a million comedy shorts of the 20s showcasing so-so pratfalls in the middle of Los Angeles, then a very pretty city. The comedy -- involving a collection agency employee who makes up wild excuses to explain his tardiness -- is better when the jokes are on the road, and involve how cars can be smacked into each other, flipped around, and seem to have mischievous minds of their own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Please Excuse Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
