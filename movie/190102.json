The comparison is unfair: Dreyer was an artist, but director Marco de Gastyne certainly proved himself a distinguished craftsman, and his emphasis on the Maid of Orléans early life in Domrémy serves as a picturesque, matching bookend to Dreyer's impassioned courtroom drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bhtoDUjmaXhfobsRAgdCqZDSgbl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rapid Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":9000,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé-Natan","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1929-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saint Joan the Maid","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
