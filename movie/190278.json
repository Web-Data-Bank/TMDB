This is the substance of Everything Turns, Richter’s first sound film. At its premier at Baden-Baden Richter got into a fight with two Nazi officials who disliked the film's ‘modernism.’ Yet in 1936 it was awarded first prize for artistic merit by the Nazis, with Richter’s name suppressed from the credits. He had long since left Germany.","popularity":1.012,"poster_path":"/17UFrKncqPX9Su1zynA8eosDJIA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57817,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis-Industrie GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1929-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Turns, Everything Revolves","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":18}
