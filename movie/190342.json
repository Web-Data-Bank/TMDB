He is panty-whipped by his social climbing second wife. She has recruited Clifford Figfield to stage and direct a charity pageant, which is more a means for her to hobnob with the social elite, and to nab Larry Lodge, the pageant's leading man, as a husband for her flighty daughter Phyllis, the pageant's leading lady. Larry ends up only having eyes for Sally McNitt, Mr. McNitt's visiting daughter, and she, in turn has eyes for him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3haiHqCnqOC8WqNt9WT56ftei1d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mack Sennett Comedies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matchmaking Mamma","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
