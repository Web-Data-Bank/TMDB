Brief glimpses of family, friends, girl-friends, the City, seasons of the year, travels. Occasionally I talk, reminisce, or play music I taped during those earlier years, plus more recent piano improvisations by Auguste Varkalis. It's a kind of autobiographical, diaristic poem, celebration of happiness and life. I consider myself a happy man.\" - Jonas Mekas","popularity":1.202,"poster_path":"/wdtjxYgmW0MElG8ynt7GWoL3ssy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anthology Film Archives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out-Takes from the Life of a Happy Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.063,"vote_count":8}
