The Labèque way follows the unique pianists as they trace their Spanish roots playing Ravel's Bolero accomplishing with Basque percussion, premiering a daring new concert they had been commissioned, and taking part in the most diverse artistic and personal adventures. Featuring friends and collaborators as Sir Simon Rattle, Semyon Bichkov and Alessandro Baricco among others, the film includes amazing performances of pieces by Mozart, Schubert, Ravel, Albeniz, Golijov and Gershwin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Labèque way","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
