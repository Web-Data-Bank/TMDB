Illness in this film is as much a psychic entity as a physical one and manifests itself in an array of theatrical tableaux from grotesque women rigorously brushing their teeth to a snooker game where the players in white face makeup behave like automata. A Tale of Smallpox uses a medical theme to chart the traumatic dream life of Terayama’s times, evincing deep-rooted concerns in the Japanese national psyche that hark back to the upheaval of Meiji modernisation and the devastation of World War Two.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tenjo Sajiki","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smallpox Tale","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
