Since the 1960s the world population has nearly doubled, adding more than 3 billion people. At the same time, talking about population has become politically incorrect because of the sensitivity of the issues surrounding the topic- religion, economics, family planning and gender inequality. The film illustrates both the over consumption and the inequity side of the population issue by following Beth, a mother, a child-rights activist and the last sibling of a large American family of twelve, as she discovers the thorny complexities of the population dilemma and highlights a different path to solve it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/drWpKoOe3xX2Ov6HjpMf35Wz8la.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother: Caring for 7 Billion","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
