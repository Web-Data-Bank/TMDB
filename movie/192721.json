He's engulfed in the war between rebels and government troops when a US advisor orders the army to open a staging area by the boy's hamlet. Alsino tries to be a child, climbing trees with a girl, looking through his grandfather's trunk of mementos and trying to fly; he goes to town to sell a saddle, has his first drink and is taken to a brothel. But the war surrounds him. The US advisor takes Alsino on a chopper flight, but he's unimpressed. The soldiers' cruelties awake rebel sympathies in Alsino, and after an army assault backfires, the lad is fully baptized into the conflict.","popularity":0.824,"poster_path":"/1DSrf8RKgyDf5AyuMZAflPYbAc2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"},{"id":17421,"logo_path":null,"name":"CRFC","origin_country":""},{"id":89825,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instituto Nicaraguense de Cine (INCINE)","origin_country":"NI"},{"id":89827,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productora Cinematográfica Latinoamericana de México","origin_country":""},{"id":89828,"logo_path":null,"name":"NFI","origin_country":""},{"id":89829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cooperativa Cinematográfica Costarricense","origin_country":""},{"id":89830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latin-American Film Releasing Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NI","name":"Nicaragua"},{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1982-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alsino and the Condor","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":15}
