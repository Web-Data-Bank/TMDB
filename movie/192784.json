Nadia, a Red Diaper baby, has a sister, Polish parents, and at 15 is an active Communist. When cops beat her during an anti-American demonstration, she's rescued by a \"Match\" photographer. As the friendship becomes a love affair and her slogans are tested by new knowledge and emotion, some of the Red youth want to expel her. When she goes with Stéphane to a seaside photo shoot, her father goes to the police. Stéphane faces charges, so leaving to cover the war in Indochina looks appealing. In a parallel story, Nadia's mother meets again her prewar lover, released from Siberia, who challenges the French Reds with very real scars and word of Stalin's anti-Semitism.","popularity":2.432,"poster_path":"/brluvhOPVp66TaAbC1bJ2yMLKUX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14435,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aldo Lado","origin_country":""},{"id":14436,"logo_path":null,"name":"C\u0026H-Film Berlin","origin_country":""},{"id":14437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Farena Films","origin_country":""},{"id":875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films A2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stéphan Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1985-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":13}
