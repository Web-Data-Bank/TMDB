They both love their cousin Zuo, but have ambitions other than marriage. Their lives change dramatically when both attend university in Shanghai and encounter modern urban life and rapidly changing society. The film also depicts the emergence of Chiang Kai-shek's 1934 New Life Movement. Lianhua Film Studio did the film to appease the Nationalist Party which accused it of primarily presenting left-wing films, which was true.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fzp9Z8uxVFylGiK50pswtjbsCw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lianhua Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1935-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Customs","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":4}
