A silent movie-style opening title informs us that the town needs a new fire engine, so they decide to stage a play to raise the money. (Nothing more is heard about this, but the finale involves a fire emergency at the theater.) In the opening scene the community players rehearse at the home of the director, a pompous lady named Mrs. Winters. Harry, of course, is The Stage Hand.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1933-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stage Hand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
