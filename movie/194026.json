It was a last hurrah for James, whose transplanted heart gave out on him the following year, but it's a worthy swansong. His unique brand of humour is captured here at its affable, non-PC, best, with Billy T giving everything he's got - every gag is rounded off with his trademark 'bro' laugh - for a loudly appreciative audience. Guests include Sir Howard Morrison.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy T James - Alive and Gigging","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
