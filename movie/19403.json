It's made him very rich, but as he hits middle age, he's so depressed and lonely that he takes on one of his victim's sons, Steve McKenna, as his apprentice. Arthur puts him through a rigorous training period and brings him on several hits. As Steven improves, Arthur worries that he'll discover who killed his father.","popularity":11.977,"poster_path":"/hizE0MwFJOBlfLSFqFNKv7cSxkT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12253,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carlino Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":8880,"logo_path":"/fE7LBw7Jz8R29EABFGCvWNriZxN.png","name":"Winkler Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":60,"logo_path":"/1SEj4nyG3JPBSKBbFhtdcHRaIF9.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He has 100 ways to kill... and they all work!","title":"The Mechanic","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":227}
