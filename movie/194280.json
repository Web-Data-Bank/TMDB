His shortcomings (drinking and smoking too much, as well as an inability to relate to his wife) are not overlooked, but Örnek suggests that they were chiefly due to his obsession with work. He had a lot to do in a very short time and achieved it.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ATATÜRK","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":3}
