He also wants to fall in love one more time before he dies. MAY I BE FRANK documents Frank’s transformation as he stumbles into the aptly-named vegan Café Gratitude, and, over 42 days, begins a life-changing journey during which he is coached physically, emotionally and spiritually by three twenty-something staff members on the path to enlightenment. Challenged by years of addiction, fatigue, and family dysfunction, Frank’s quest for a healthier lifestyle is both tense and touching. Through Frank’s metamorphosis, we witness the powerful effects of change upon one person’s life, and the potential we all have to find the most important love of all–love of ourselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jLIOSjdywBFk0PbN7dRiNz4HRz6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"May I Be Frank","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
