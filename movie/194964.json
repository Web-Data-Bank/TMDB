The videos featured crude MS Paint animation and a loud, highpitched, childlike voice narrating. On September 7, the fifth, final episode was released, but featured an unexpected twist - about 20 seconds into it, the crude sketchy animation switched to intricately crafted 3D with an orchestral soundtrack; the whole Octocat story (and as such, the Randy Peters persona) was revealed to be by David O'Reilly.[8] In an interview he said \"I wanted to try experimenting with the Youtube audience and Microsoft Paint. The story for Octocat came to me by reading the bible word-for-word backwards\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Octocat Adventures","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
