The inscription “Charlemagne 53790K” readable on the turret suggests that this view was shot in the vicinity of Saint-Chamond, a town where there are factories specializing in the construction of heavy steel. It is certainly a turret intended for the battleship “Charlemagne”. In addition, a view projected by the Aléthorama on January 20, 1898 in Saint-Étienne, and entitled “Transportation of the armored turret of Saint-Chamond by a team of 80 horses”, could represent the same event.","popularity":1.903,"poster_path":"/bqqEMl5v5a0Y7x0IiwNDweI5lGU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumière","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1897-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transport of a Turret by a Team of 60 Horses","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":22}
