U2 chose the castle venue because it marked two watershed moments for the band: their recording session for the landmark album THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE in 1984, and their first Slane appearance opening up for fellow Irish rock band Thin Lizzy in 1981. U2 GO HOME captures the emotional intensity of the homecoming with 19 live tracks culled from the concerts.","popularity":2.895,"poster_path":"/9NgFSXeZztxQ8Wokw3HMFJN5xd0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle, Ireland","video":true,"vote_average":8.261,"vote_count":23}
