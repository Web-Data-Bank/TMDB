One part \"ruin porn\", one part \"ghost story”, and entirely shot on 16mm, the film brings together performance art, narrative gesture, and social realism not only to play with convention and defy genre, but also to pay homage to a disappearing life-world and a fading medium.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pRK2m4WXOO4MVizh69QhswyfvCG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harvard Sensory Ethnography Lab","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2013-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"YUMEN","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
