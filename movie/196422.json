Nicole Molino (Catherine Spaak) and Nicola Molino (Gianni Garko) are not related to one another.  In fact, they don’t even know each other until both are inadvertently assigned the same hotel room on the island of Ischia.  Nicole isn’t interested in any hanky-panky, so Nicola reluctantly promises to keep his hands to himself.","popularity":1.281,"poster_path":"/33gO8HtDI7a0loYdDUqr3JEeYJf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1216,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1962-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bikinis...
