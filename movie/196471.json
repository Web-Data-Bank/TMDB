The housemaid enters, bringing a message from Franz, who convenes the Baron to an urgent meeting at the Club. Excusing himself, and thoroughly kissing his wife good-evening, the Baron leaves - to meet some lady of the night in the club's private room, with champagne and a sofa for two. At home, the Baroness gets bored, until she has an idea, soon put to practice. She sends a man a letter, signed Divine Lola, giving him rendez-vous at a discreet pension. The modern Eve is not taking her husband's infidelities sitting down. She lays in her undershirt on a bed inviting her lover in, in a long embrace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mOOY18SZu2O4iWf2c5egw3iE0Dp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saturn-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1907-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Modern Marriage","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
