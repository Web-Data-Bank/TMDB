The artist is wearing a white shirt over his grey trousers, shirt and necktie, and he is wearing black shoes. With hammer and chisel, he applies the last touches on his last piece of sculpture - The Three Graces, standing nude on a rectangular podium covered with a white bed-shirt. He steps back, contemplates his work, and rejoices on the beauty he has achieved. He goes out momentarily, and brings a bottle of champagne and a glass; before drinking, he makes a toast to his finished statue. He drinks, smokes a cigarette, and contemplates his work - until he falls asleep on the chaise lounge. Only then do The Three Graces stir, and tip-toe around their creator. One even dares to approach her lips to the artist's.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1j6EW15diEaheL8NMBnS2lq89CZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1907-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sculptor's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5.833,"vote_count":6}
