Two years later, everything changes. The land disappears and the young people grow up in a new state. The former director of studies Prof. Peter Forster manages to continue the study after the political upheaval until today. Thus, a remarkable collection of material has emerged, fully spent yet in the GDR over the last born, childhood, and adolescence. There are the personal biographies of the study participants who bear witness to the process of transformation from a socialist system of the GDR into the capitalist system of the Federal Republic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14611,"logo_path":"/zyYiJh2xwQl95KXc3g9CFRLLDCN.png","name":"Hoferichter \u0026 Jacobs","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Suddenly we were German citizens","title":"Generation Wende","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
