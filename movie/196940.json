In the story, a cheerfully naughty girl crosses paths with a witch who has the power to satisfy her curiosity about men by changing her into a young man. She then becomes one of the boy suitors for the amorous attentions of a policeman's daughter. Some of the men have unusual names and even odder magical gifts: one of them has the ability to make a man's genitals disappear when he shakes hands with him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/399VYKyl8sBpz3MEDunsyfgAl1z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kola Case","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quartier Mozart","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
