It also a sexually unresponsive wife's revenge against her cheating husband. Heiress Georgina Oliphant, the daughter of pharmaceutical magnate George Oliphant is on a mission to find a sculptor suitable of her father's sponsorship. Normally, George doesn't give a hoot about art, but tax time approaches and he needs a big deduction. Since large bronze statues are 100% deductible, that's what he wants. Georgina comes through with the lesbian sculptor Lily Carmichael who suggests a detailed male nude, sans fig leaf. For her model, lily chooses unemployed hunk Karl-Heinz Applebaum who at first doesn't realize he is to model totally nude. Fortunately, coquettish Georgina is around to convince him to shed those clothes.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/9IzqzKvOjUbz0gySTuHNysuZYNl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lust and Revenge","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
