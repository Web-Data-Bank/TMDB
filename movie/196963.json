Anguely V Rayou is another example of these \"youth without future\" films. Based on the novel Two Notebooks by Piotr Kojevnikov, the action takes place in the Leningrad of 1975, when the \"stagnation\" era is at its peak. Two teenagers, Micha and Galia, are experiencing a slow death in the slums of the city. Galia's aunt is going crazy in her desperation. Micha's mother is killed by a drunk. One of their friends has committed suicide. These kids are typical of a generation wasted by alcohol and misfortune. Some are bound to become outcasts, some will be destroyed, and others will be sacrificed in Afghanistan. The title is ironic, as there is neither paradise nor angels in this story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4K73cDLCupRU5XoBPVnFbDPgkKQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angels in Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
