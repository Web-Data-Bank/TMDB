Following the Meech referendum, Quebec and Canada found themselves at an impasse after a long and ultimately fruitless negotiation, various social and political actors spoke out.

Macdonald, Louis-Joseph Papineau...), draw parallels between the speeches of yesterday and those of the post-Meech era.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3nKYPycu674fzgM3QeAxtYNY1TQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":231,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Sheep","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
