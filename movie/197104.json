Ice Man or not, Albert was on fire the night of his taping on October 28, 1991. His performance was a wild ride, and the ACL stage proved too small for his antics, so with his long guitar chord in tow he took off into the audience during his ten-minute-plus finale of Frosty. He was first and foremost an entertainer, but nonetheless belongs up front in the pantheon of great blues guitarists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yYCekp6yyQQkGI6PV8YTq0Emw13.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albert Collins: Live From Austin, TX","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
