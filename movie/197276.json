The 23rd Headquarters Special Troops used inflatable rubber tanks, sound trucks, and dazzling performance art to bluff the enemy again and again, often right along the front lines. Many of the men picked to carry out these dangerous deception missions were artists. Some went on to become famous, including fashion designer Bill Blass. In their spare time, they painted and sketched their way across Europe, creating a unique and moving visual record of their war. Their secret mission was kept hushed up for nearly 50 years after the war's end.","popularity":2.227,"poster_path":"/hkXg7Gc2powdiprLtblMZEwBFPT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plate of Peas Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Illusion was their ultimate weapon.","title":"The Ghost Army","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":11}
