A film director (Meto Jovanovski) gathers information for his documentary about the Serbs being forced to depart by Albanian Moslems. As the region heads towards ethnic warfare, the young Albanian woman Nadira (Sonja Jacevska) falls in love with the Serbian Miloljub (Cedo Arobabic). He is captured and castrated, and the private lives of Milobjub and Nadira become part of the director's story in his film. He must answer to the financiers and producers who believe his film was to be a comedy. The events foreshadow a long and bloody conflict between two factions, a battle that has not abated in the ten years since this film's initial release.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/mh9s1Di4Y4aR9Y5nZCI8T2OgLbB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centar film","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":28221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beograd Film","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1988-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Film with No Name","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
