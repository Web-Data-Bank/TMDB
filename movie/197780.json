A wave of period details situate the film in both time and milieu. The culture of its audience, 1970s students, is evoked and displayed via a mattress on the floor, an ethnic rug, the kilim bedpsread, homebrew jars, denim clothes and by hair: long hair, facial hair - beards. The main actors are dead ringers for the infamous cover stars of Alex Comfort's The Joy of Sex, published the year before.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/2A19tnCRa6KWTH9MiNP24XnsA0a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":63539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oxford Polytechnic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's no need to make an abortion of it.","title":"'Ave You Got a Male Assistant Please Miss?","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
