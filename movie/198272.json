A mildly-mustachioed, 25-year-old Pinoy wrecking ball named Manny Pacquiao, fresh off a knockout of legendary Mexican warrior Marco Antonio Barrera, is making his third trip to the featherweight division. He has defended his super bantamweight titles eight times and, after taking home The Ring featherweight title at the expense of Barrera, is looking to expand his trophy case by adding the WBA and IBF featherweight titles.  Rather reluctant to part with them is 30-year-old Juan Manuel MÃ¡rquez. Aside from a highly-controversial split-decision loss in 1999 and a disqualification in his debut, he is unbeaten in more than 40 fights. Of his last 11 opponents, 10 have been stopped before the final bell, the sole survivor losing a technical decision.  Considering that Pacquiao has stopped 12 of his last 13, all but two inside six rounds, that this fight will be absolutely crazy is pretty much a given.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hearts and fists on fire.","title":"Pacquiao vs Marquez I","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
