In the beginning of the film, Angel is traveling with his friend Max on a ship to Honeyfield, a town on the coast of Australia. He is coming home to die. Instead, he dies on board the ship, willing his boots to Angel, and an unopened package to someone called \"The Dead Man,\" in Honeyfield. Also on the ship is a man named Tatts, a far less pleasant personality. When Angel gets off to head into Honeyfield, Tatts decides to follow along unseen. The package, Angel was told, contains something its intended recipient has been looking for without knowing it. On finding the recipient, a mean-spirited old man who is more or less the boss and owner of the town, he learns that the package contains opium.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c66K68p1ObmKwmGESCNbY8rDtBB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Highway","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
