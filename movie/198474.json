Mattia Pascal is a downtrodden average man, treated like trash by his fiancée, scorned by his associates, and cheated out of his inheritance by contemptuous relatives. The dispirited Pascal heads to Monte Carlo, accruing a fortune and also assuming the identity of a less fortunate gambler who killed himself. The \"new\" Pascal is treated with a dignity and respect that overwhelms him--and nearly kills him.","popularity":2.21,"poster_path":"/5QuLt0Y7BDdS6ljz0NzVHf33Yxn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1042,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinecittà","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":63890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Excelsior Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1985-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":178,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 2 Lives of Mattia Pascal","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":17}
