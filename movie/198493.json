This instigates a mid-life crisis over his own identity and his sense of security and self-worth, all exacerbated by a recent divorce and estrangement from his son. Recognizing that he needs help, the man goes for therapy and starts to face his problems. Therapy counteracts some of the damage of living, and the man starts to consider his son, his relationships with women, and his father in a different light.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/xpAGVKc6wmxsQ9NiR9KcmKHKCY3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Budapest Filmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1981-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Potteries","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
