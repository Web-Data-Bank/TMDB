Early in his regime, the resources and agricultural products his country sells command high prices, and he is a reasonably confident, even gentle, ruler who likes to take long vacations with his daughter in Paris. After World War I, with falling prices and a number of coup attempts behind him, his rule becomes quite cruel.","popularity":1.27,"poster_path":"/6DEhZcfvrnIsmZ5zowugNUFLPkB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones America","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1978-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Recourse to the Method","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":6}
