These lines, usually hidden by the projector gate, are revealed as subject matter and as a means of dividing the screen into as many as four very wide images, stacked one above the other. They represent many places, and a few people. My intent was to find ways to allow the images to interact in ways not usually possible. The track includes some Irish fiddle solos and intense recycled dialog.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yt4rVOvMzMIg8tfYrVB9ClzvLY1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horizontal Boundaries","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":8}
