In Disneyesque fashion, the film details the day-to-day existence of the Norwegian Laplanders. The \"story\" concentrates on the annual odyssey wherein the Lapland reindeer are shepherded to snow-free grazing lands. Not surprisingly, director Per Host is more fascinated with the reindeer than with the human characters -- and, by extension, so is the audience. The film was lensed in economical Eastmancolor, meaning that most existing prints have washed out over the past 40 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sY8M6Wqt2g3uBwZ8UZA52x248Nd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last of the Nomads","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
