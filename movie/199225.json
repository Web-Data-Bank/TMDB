The star runs the emotional gamut as Gabriela, who rises from the depths of poverty to the heights of Mexican society as a much-sought-after courtesan. Eventually, however, Gabriela proves that she is still true to her peasant heritage by casting her lot with the rebels in the 1916 Mexican civil war. Pedro Armendariz co-stars as Felipe, the charismatic rebel leader who wins Gabriela's heart - and inadvertently causes her downfall. La escondida is stunningly photographed by the late, great Gabriel Figueroa.","popularity":1.132,"poster_path":"/vIeusAEZ8BZ08SVDaQNoxSdW38r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alfa Film S.A.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1956-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hidden One","video":false,"vote_average":4.929,"vote_count":7}
