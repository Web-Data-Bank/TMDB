The cast of characters is extremely unlikely in almost every conventional respect. The action involves the household of the prominent Dr. Stepanov and his young wife, Masha, who share their large and richly adorned mansion with the parasitical Fedor Tsitronov, whose presence in the household is given only the most implausible of explanations. Equally implausible is the acquaintance of the family with the young and proud Grisha Fokin, whose leadership role in the Young Communist League is never clearly defined and who is never seen engaged in any work or professional activity.","popularity":0.792,"poster_path":"/vv6t0CkqnOmU8CCCFalxMu9wlmB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ukrainfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1935-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Severe Young Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
