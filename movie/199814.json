When he feels choked up, he tries not to let go of hope by playing on the drums. Out of guilt that he might have made Jongdae sexually handicapped during their younger days, Kisu took on a role as Jongdae's guardian on top of being his friend.

One day Kisu's older brother shows up and leave behind his son Yohan to Kisu's care.","popularity":1.003,"poster_path":"/zpR0HjRvTHd1L0st8VOebVrAzrR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79409,"logo_path":"/6Eoq8GPUXJtFGQSe99bc4YZHYg2.png","name":"Generation Blue Films","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":2467,"logo_path":"/xL4wmWQIOunKxEb89vtFrOlb0DD.png","name":"Sponge Ent.","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":11431,"logo_path":null,"name":"DCG Plus","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2007-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boys of Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8}
