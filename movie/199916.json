The smart but naughty farmhands son's eternal mischief, pranks and disobedience drive his elders (especially teachers, family and father's grumpy employer, a rich farmer, but also neighbors and even the kind curate whose liturgical server he is) and classmates to despair in a time when a boy's punishment was still inevitable, swift and often severe; thus when his mother catches him skinny dipping she takes all his clothes home, forcing him to a long walk of shame, dreading dad's wrath all the way. This version also stresses the story's social and Flamingant aspects.","popularity":1.672,"poster_path":"/4alMRfBtdnmfVfIOq2AORcHc8Mo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14859,"logo_path":null,"name":"New-Star Films","origin_country":""},{"id":57178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visie Filmproduktie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1980-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whitey","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":12}
