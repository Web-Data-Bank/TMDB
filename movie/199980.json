The island's intensity reminds Andrea of her schizophrenic brother Jacob, a young man who isn’t bound by the conventional standards. “Delusional” thought and “erratic” behavior seem not so different from Andrea’s untamed surroundings in which the wind rants, the clouds are grandiose and the seasons bi-polar.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fXucqYkGQgW9dUvKW51jCfKbGV2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Send You This Place","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
