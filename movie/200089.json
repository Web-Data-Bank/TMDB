With over 6,000 pages of handwritten notes and drawings, da Vinci’s private journals are the most comprehensive documents that chronicle the work of the world’s most renowned inventor, philosopher, painter and genius.  Using this precious collection of writings and drawings to recount Da Vinci’s story in his own words, and combining them with stunning visual effects and 3D technology, we re-create the mindscape and ideas of mankind’s greatest polymath.","popularity":1.974,"poster_path":"/7apE2u0IIzXd72Or345AHcZWn1h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30249,"logo_path":"/nHNMrZ0I1ybL1jzEbNPTZZkyLE2.png","name":"IWC Media","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":40449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Handel Productions","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside the Mind of Leonardo","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
