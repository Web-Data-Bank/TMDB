Six years later, Cici Shin (Charine Chan Kar-ling) and her cousin, Lily Li (Ann Bridgewater), open a boutique and need a mirror for their fitting room. The mall security guard finds one for them in the basement but, naturally, Pinkish Red resides inside it and, when Cici cleans the mirror’s surface, the ghost is able to enter back into the real world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5pk94kZ9Wqvm1MyCmGLVP8ql1HT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Long Shong Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abracadabra","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
