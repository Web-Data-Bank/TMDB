In the course of an ongoing career that encompasses ground-breaking music, global gigging, award winning albums, and as many front covers &amp; critical backslaps as one lifetime can sensibly handle, Malmsteen has virtually reinvented the guitar as an instrument to be seen with. This DVD set includes 4 promo videos (\"Bedroom Eyes,\" \"Heaven Tonight,\" \"Save Our Love,\" and \"You Don't Remember\"), plus an interview with Barry Barnes conducted in 2006 at Malmsteen's studio in Miami, FL.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bz3jD1AxKYgwSbGzMN0x3piTSSq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Pictures UK","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yngwie Malmsteen: Far Beyond the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
